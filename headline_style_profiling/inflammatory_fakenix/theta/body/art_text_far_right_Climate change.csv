Few people now deny that the natural environment is in profound peril from climate change. But recognising the dangers and doing something tangible about it are two different matters – as we’ve seen during the COP27 conference in Egypt.

Alok Sharma, the UK government’s representative, said the goal of keeping global warming within 1.5c was now on life support and many delegates were sorry that no progress was made on a commitment to cut fossil fuels. But it was not all doom and gloom. We welcome the creation of the so-called ‘loss and damage fund’, whereby rich countries will pay poorer countries for the damage and economic losses caused by climate change. This ends several decades of agonising debate on the issue and we hope this creates some much-needed momentum in the fight to preserve our planet for generations to come.

Qatar is already a loser The World Cup is underway and it was an underwhelming opening day for the hosts. FIFA must have hoped that the first game would in some small way have vindicated the extraordinary decision to give the tournament to a country which has never before qualified. But it did not turn out that way. Qatar lost to Ecuador – the first time a host nation has lost its opening match - and by the end of the 90 minutes, many of the seats in the stadium were empty. World Cups normally are joyous festivals of football but this one already has been bogged down by controversy. Indeed, British broadcasters chose not to show the glitzy opening ceremony. Holding the World Cup in winter clearly is absurd. Holding it in a country where we might never know how many migrant workers died building the stadiums is nothing short of a scandal. Even so, we wish the England and Wales teams well. Victory in that heat and against such a fiery backdrop would be a huge achievement.

67c1b5e6-4fc4-4139-b203-9b0ba6c47117,"The Biden administration has signed onto a UN-backed agreement to pay poor countries dealing with extreme weather disasters worsened by climate change.

Biden’s special climate envoy John Kerry was part of the deal making at the UN climate summit in Egypt that established a long-discussed fund early Sunday that some call reparations from rich countries with high carbon omissions.

A larger agreement was still in the works at the 27th UN Climate Change Conference, or COP27, as debate continued over emission-reduction efforts.

But the US could chip in $1 billion this year and billions more in years to come – even as China won’t be contributing to the fund.

The fund will include money from developed countries and other sources including private enterprises but “emerging economy” China won’t be required to put any money up front. The European Union and US have argued China and other developing countries are big-time polluters and should fork over some of their wealth into the fund.

The option of China chipping in remains on the table and could be negotiated in the future.

Countries pushed to establish the fund because poorer countries often face climate-driven crises but don’t largely contribute to global pollution.

The US and allies have long resisted such a plan but a spokesman for Kerry confirmed before the deal was struck that the US was also working to join the deal, CNN reported.

Diplomats attending the COP27 climate conference told the Washington Post that they still have to negotiate other aspects of the conference’s final agreement, including how diligent countries have to be in their efforts to curb emissions.

Previous 1 of 2 Next Countries attending the UN climate summit in Egypt are hammering out an agreement to create a historic climate fund for nations. A group of climate change activists held banners and signs during a demonstration.

But many at the conference in the Egyptian resort in Sharm El-Sheikh were already the agreement to create the fund, which would be the first in the 30-year history of UN climate conferences to help developing countries cope with “loss and damage” from irreversible climate disasters.

“30 years of patience,” tweeted Alpha Kaloga, Guinea’s lead negotiator at the summit. “YES a new Fund for responding Loss and Damage in developing countries….This is a unique moment a win for all citizens of the world.”

The annual budget deal signed by Biden in March authorized a $1 billion expenditure for international climate finance – a figure far lower than the eye-popping $11 billion of taxpayer money that Biden has pledged to spend by 2024, climate activists complain.

A new study found climate change was linked to an increase in symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, dementia, and multiple sclerosis, according to the American Academy of Neurology.

American Academy of Neurology included the results of the study in their medical journal Neurology.

The research also found warmer weather increased the transmission of insect-borne infections, underscoring the devastating effects of increasing worldwide temperatures.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration claims temperatures have increased by 0.32 degrees each decade since 1980.

Researchers combed through hundreds of studies on pollutants, climate and temperature changes and neurologic disease in adults dating back to 1990.

Scientists found hotter warmer summers and more severe weather events increased stress on the human heart as it worked harder to pump blood and stay cool, exacerbating both major and minor medical conditions.

The host of affected medical conditions were also aggravated by dehydration, which is increasingly common in hot climates. A lack of water can cause human brain tissue to shrink and put pressure on nerves.

Airborne nitrates and fine pollutant particles caused by climate change are also absorbed into the bloodstream, driving up the risk of brain disorders and neurological diseases, the non-peer-reviewed study found.

“Although the international community seeks to reduce global temperature rise to under 2.7 ºF before 2100, irreversible environmental changes have already occurred, and as the planet warms these changes will continue to occur,” said review author Andrew Dhawan, MD, DPhil, of Cleveland Clinic in Ohio and a member of the American Academy of Neurology.

“As we witness the effects of a warming planet on human health, it is imperative that neurologists anticipate how neurologic disease may change.”

The study found that climate change expanded areas where weather conditions expose more people to West Nile virus, meningococcal meningitis and tick-borne encephalitis.

In addition, stronger and more frequent natural disasters caused by global warming result in medical care disruptions. Researchers said there was an “unmet need in planning” for neurologic care “in the face of ecological instability.”

“Climate change poses many challenges for humanity, some of which are not well-studied,” said Dhawan, the study’s lead author.

“For example, our review did not find any articles related to effects on neurologic health from food and water insecurity, yet these are clearly linked to neurologic health and climate change.”

Dhawan said more research was needed on how air pollution affects the nervous system and how to mitigate and treat the spread of climate-related sicknesses."
267737c2-3571-4965-a6b5-da6008e05b25,"Ugandan climate activist Vanessa Nakate slammed world leaders Tuesday who persist in backing new fossil fuel projects as other activists held a symbolic human and environmental rights protest and called for financing for vulnerable nations suffering devastating impacts of climate change.

Countries agreed in the 2015 Paris climate accord to limit global warming to 2.7 Fahrenheit by the end of the century if possible. But scientists say that with about 2.1 Fahrenheit of warming already reached, that target is likely to be missed, pushing temperatures to dangerous highs.

""The focus for many leaders is about making deals for fossil fuel lobbyists, surviving the next election cycle and grabbing as much short-term profit as possible,"" Nakate said at an event on the sidelines of the U.N. climate talks in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt.

She warned that the annual meeting is being infiltrated by oil and gas representatives who are turning it into ""a sales and marketing conference for more pollution and more destruction and more devastation.""

NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS URGE WORLD LEADERS TO RAISE HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES AT EGYPT CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE

Environmental groups have counted more than 600 delegates with links to the fossil fuel industry at the two-week meeting.

Nakate cited research from the International Energy Agency stating that there can be no new investment in coal, oil or gas if the world is to stay below 1.5 C.

This was being undermined by massive public spending on fossil fuel subsidies, partly as a result of the fallout from Russia's attack on Ukraine which has triggered a scramble for alternative sources of oil and gas.

""You are sowing the wind and frontline communities are reaping the whirlwind,"" she said. ""You are sowing seeds of coal, oil and gas while frontline communities are reaping havoc, devastation and destruction.""

Many developing nations are disproportionately impacted by climate change as they are less able to adapt to extreme weather exacerbated by global warming.

Nakate called out those countries that have issued new licenses for oil and gas exploitation in their territorial waters, or promised investments in new fossil fuel infrastructure in Africa.

EGYPT'S MOST PROMINENT IMPRISONED ACTIVIST HAS BEGUN A 'FULL HUNGER STRIKE'

Jochen Flasbarth, a long-time German climate negotiator, said Nakate was right to highlight the urgency of tackling climate change but questioned her criticism of politicians concerned about elections.

""You might be right that politicians sometimes have a short-term view, but (you should) still make the best out of these elections,"" he said, adding that ""it is young people who increasingly did not go to elections over the last ten years"" in many democratic nations.

Flasbarth told Nakate that young people ""need to collaborate"" with democratic processes to help ""strengthen democracy around the world.""

Later Tuesday, a handful of climate activists gathered outside the conference venue in a symbolic protest to highlight what they said was restrictions and clampdowns on environmental and human rights defenders.

Organized by the Fridays for Future Movement, the brief demonstration took place in the official designated protest area amid tight security. Organizers said they received the required permission from the Egyptian authorities, but they declined to speak to media at the protest venue saying they didn't want to legitimize it.

They said the symbolic protest aimed to showcase ""restrictions on civil society and protest"" at this year's conference.

SEWAGE PIPE IN EGYPT BURSTS AFTER COP27 ATTENDEES COMPLAIN ABOUT LACK OF BASIC NECESSITIES

""We are protesting on behalf of and in solidarity with all those who can’t raise their voices, we are here demanding the liberation of those who have been silenced,"" said activist Luisa Neubauer in a speech.

Protests at this year's conference have so far been broadly limited to the ‘Blue Zone,’ which is considered a U.N. territory.

Climate activists have repeatedly complained that restrictions and costly accommodation has discouraged large protests this year, in a stark contrast to previous years that featured large demonstrations. Last year's COP26 in Glasgow in Scotland, saw some 100,000 people marching through the streets in one rally and protesters frequently gathered in public squares and parks.

Street protests are virtually banned in Egypt, but the government set up a designated area outside the negotiating venue for demonstrations.

Activists also called for the establishment of a new body to be in charge of climate-related loss and damage for developing funding for nations vulnerable to global warming.

The demonstrations come as negotiators at the conference haggle over numerous thorny issues including increasing efforts to cut greenhouse gases and providing more financial help to poor nations.

NPR's comically titled newscast ""All Things Considered"" ran a U.N.-boosting story on Nov. 7 that they headlined ""U.N. climate conference opens with alarming warnings about the global climate."" There was no dissent allowed from the ""highway to climate hell"" talk.

Anchor Elissa Nadworny helpfully asked reporter Ruth Sherlock what the U.N. hoped to accomplish. Sherlock touted ""developing"" countries demanding ""loss and damage"" money, insisting ""wealthier countries that are responsible for most of the carbon dioxide emissions should pay reparations to emerging economies.""

Conservatives are calling this the ""Sharm el-Sheikh-down.""

The only dissenting note on NPR, naturally, was from the left of the U.N. establishment, from Greta Thunberg-style extremists who want to ban capitalism. Nadworny asked about Egypt hosting this conference, since they do not typically tolerate much dissent.

NPR was proud to push the U.N. leader's warnings, but they didn't quote from this protester sign photographed in Egypt: ""Climate change denial deserves the death penalty."" Let's hope that's just one doomsday crank. But the authoritarians at the U.N. clearly need the doomsday sound because they want a climate crackdown more severe than the COVID shutdowns.

They define that as the sensible governing center, with Greta Thunberg -- Time's 2019 Person of the Year -- goading for more. Authoritarian extremism is painted as idealism.

Every democratic nation on Earth has to attempt to translate these demands into policy that doesn't cause a voter revolt. The result is a whole lot of verbal deference to globalist demands, followed by policies that ""fall short.""

The media yelled at Team Trump for pulling out of the Paris Agreement. What they wanted was an insincere endorsement of environmental extremism, and then a policy that was far less severe than what the U.N. wants.

Fears have emerged that King Charles III risks destorying the legacy of Queen Elizabeth II if he follows advice from Andrew Marr. The new sovereign has previously been warned about meddling in politics, but now as Liz Truss' Government threaten to accelerate fossil fuel extraction by introducing more oil drilling and fracking, Charles' passion for environmentalism could be the country's hope for a greener future, some commentators claim.

But Charles's input on political matters around environmental issues could ""risk everything his mother worked so long to protect"", journalist Dominic Lawson warned. As head of state, the monarch is expected to remain strictly neutral with respect to political matters. The monarch does, however, retain the right to appoint and also meet with the Prime Minister on a regular basis. Queen Elizabeth II is said to have remained neutral throughout her 70-year reign, but some claim Charles' dedication to green issues could now be needed as Ms Truss' policies threaten to cause further damage to the environment.

King Charles III has been a strong advocate for environmentalism since the 1970s

Writing for the New Statesman, Andrew Marr, the former BBC political editor and presenter, said the current state of politics in the UK had caused him to ""rethink"" his stance on Charles's involvement in government matters. He said: ""Like many, I've always argued that on the throne he must relinquish his previous views and campaigning… a King who meddles in politics would seem to be in particular danger."" But he has now decided, ""to put it bluntly, right-wing ministers thinking about a difficult election in 2024 and with a record of hostility to 'green c**p', can't be trusted"". ""A King who feels differently … might be the best short-term argument for the monarchy,"" he added. READ MORE: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry 'tried to do Megxit by email'

The UK has previously committed to legally-binding targets to reduce carbon emissions by 2050 to achieve net zero. But Ms Truss, who became Prime Minister on September 6, has already lifted the ban on fracking with plans to potentially cut out the consent process from local communities. The Truss administration has also ditched schemes intended to block North Sea oil and gas projects deemed ""incompatible"" with net-zero targets. Despite the new King's passion for environmentalism, he previously confirmed he would not intervene in such political issues once he ascends the throne.

A “United in Science” report notes that greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise to record-breaking highs, with fossil fuel emission levels having now exceeded pre-pandemic levels following a temporary lull amid the Covid lockdowns. The experts warn that emissions reduction targets for 2030 need to be a whopping seven times higher in order to meet the goal of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 2.7F (1.5C) above pre-industrial levels. In fact, following the seven warmest years on record, scientists have predicted that there is now a 48 percent chance that the mean annual temperature will exceed this threshold for at least one year in the next five — worsening extreme weather conditions that hit the most vulnerable the hardest.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres said: “Floods, droughts, heatwaves, extreme storms and wildfires are going from bad to worse, breaking records with alarming frequency. There are, he noted, “heatwaves in Europe. Colossal floods in Pakistan. Prolonged and severe droughts in China, the Horn of Africa and the United States. “There is nothing natural about the new scale of these disasters. They are the price of humanity’s fossil addiction. “This year’s ‘United in Science’ report shows climate impacts heading into uncharted territory of destruction. Yet each we double-down on this fossil fuel addition, even as the symptoms get rapidly worse.”

UN Secretary-General António Guterres said extreme weather events like heatwaves are getting worse

The ‘United in Science‘ report notes that greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise

The alarming findings of the report come amid fresh warnings from scientists last week that Earth is on the brink of various climate “tipping points”, past which it will be difficult to return. According to the World Meteorological Organization, the number of weather, climate and water-related disasters has increased by a factor of five over the past half-century, to the cost of some 115 lives and $202million in losses daily. A spokesperson said: “As attribution science continues to improve, evidence of the link between human-induced climate change and observed extremes — such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation and tropical cyclones — has strengthened.” For example, the international World Weather Attribution initiative has concluded that climate change likely increased the intensity of the rainfall experienced during recent tropical cyclones hitting south-eastern Africa.

Kardashian recently graced the cover of Interview Magazine, and gave an extensive interview to journalist Mel Ottenberg. Their discussion veered onto the topic of global warming, and Kardashian revealed that in spite of caring deeply about the environment, she believes “you have to pick and choose what really works for you in your life.” Evidently, what “works for” her happens to be luxurious trips in a private jet that leaves a huge carbon footprint — because it’s essential to her lifestyle.

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Interview Magazine (@interviewmag)

Ottenberg discussed a variety of issues with Kardashian ranging from fashion to her new blonde look, then steered the conversation toward the environment. “Global warming. It is actually insane. There are fires in the south of France, the tarmac is melting in England,” Ottenberg said.

“Do you feel like you do anything to combat and prevent that?” he asked Kardashian. Ottenberg then interjected and said, “I don’t think I do that much, to be honest, and I’m curious what your thoughts are?”

Kardashian revealed her true feelings, but they weren’t what most fans expected to hear.

“I believe in climate change, and I believe that anything can help,” Kardashian said.

This comes on the heels of a report that revealed the celebrities with the biggest carbon footprints — a list that featured Kardashian’s sister, Kylie Jenner, on, according to a study conducted by Yard.

“But I also believe in being realistic and I think sometimes there’s so much to worry about on this planet, and it can be really scary to live your life with anxiety,” Kardashian continued. (RELATED: REPORT: Leo DiCaprio Used Dark Money To Annoy People With Climate Lawsuits)

The reality TV star then started dancing around the topic and quickly lost any credibility she may have had. “I have super climate-change-involved friends, and I love learning from them,” she said before burying herself with the next sentence.

“I do what I can, but you have to pick and choose what really works for you in your life.”

Kardashian’s claim to care about the planet extends no further than having friends that do their part. She, of course, doesn’t feel she has to do hers — unless she feels like it. She’ll pick and choose her environmentally-sound moments but is definitely not prepared to give up her jet-setting habits.

The only thing Ottenberg could mutter after her deep revelation was the word “yeah.”

Kardashian sealed her fate when she concluded the conversation by defending her laissez-faire approach. “No one’s going to be 100 percent perfect,” she said."

Estimated read time: 4-5 minutes

WASHINGTON — Zombie ice from the massive Greenland ice sheet will eventually raise global sea level by at least 10 inches on its own, according to a study released Monday.

Zombie, or doomed ice, is ice that is still attached to thicker areas of ice, but is no longer getting fed by those larger glaciers. That's because the parent glaciers are getting less replenishing snow. Meanwhile the doomed ice is melting from climate change, said study co-author William Colgan, a glaciologist at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland.

""It's dead ice. It's just going to melt and disappear from the ice sheet,"" Colgan said in an interview. ""This ice has been consigned to the ocean, regardless of what climate (emissions) scenario we take now.""

Study lead author Jason Box, a glaciologist at the Greenland survey, said it is ""more like one foot in the grave.""

The unavoidable 10 inches in the study is more than twice as much sea level rise as scientists had previously expected from the melting of Greenland's ice sheet. The study in the journal Nature Climate Change said it could reach as much as 30 inches. By contrast, last year's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report projected a range of 2 to 5 inches for likely sea level rise from Greenland ice melt by the year 2100.

What scientists did for the study was look at the ice in balance. In perfect equilibrium, snowfall in the mountains in Greenland flows down and recharges and thickens the sides of glaciers, balancing out what's melting on the edges. But in the last few decades there's less replenishment and more melting, creating imbalance. Study authors looked at the ratio of what's being added to what's being lost and calculated that 3.3% of Greenland's total ice volume will melt no matter what happens with the world cutting carbon pollution, Colgan said.

""I think starving would be a good phrase,"" for what's happening to the ice, Colgan said.

One of the study authors said that more than 120 trillion tons of ice is already doomed to melt from the warming ice sheet's inability to replenish its edges. When that ice melts into water, if it were concentrated only over the United States, it would be 37 feet deep.

(Photo: Mstyslav Chernov, Associated Press)

This is the first time scientists calculated a minimum ice loss — and accompanying sea level rise — for Greenland, one of Earth's two massive ice sheets that are slowly shrinking because of climate change from burning coal, oil and natural gas. Scientists used an accepted technique for calculating minimum committed ice loss, the one used on mountain glaciers for the entire giant frozen island.

Pennsylvania State University glaciologist Richard Alley, who wasn't part of the study but said it made sense, said the committed melting and sea level rise is like an ice cube put in a cup of hot tea in a warm room.

""You have committed mass loss from the ice,"" Alley said in an email. ""In the same way most of the world's mountain glaciers and the edges of Greenland would continue losing mass if temperatures were stabilized at modern levels because they have been put into warmer air just as your ice cube was put in warmer tea.""

Although 10 inches doesn't sound like much, that's a global average. Some coastal areas will be hit with more, and high tides and storms on top of that could be even worse, so this much sea level rise ""will have huge societal, economic and environmental impacts,"" said Ellyn Enderlin, a geosciences professor at Boise State University.

Time is the key unknown here and a bit of a problem with the study, said two outside ice scientists, Leigh Stearns of the University of Kansas and Sophie Nowicki of the University of Buffalo. The researchers in the study said they couldn't estimate the timing of the committed melting, yet in the last sentence they mention, ""within this century,"" without supporting it, Stearns said.

Colgan responded that the team doesn't know how long it will take for all the doomed ice to melt, but making an educated guess, it would probably be by the end of this century or at least by 2150.

Colgan said this is actually all a best-case scenario. The year 2012 (and to a different degree 2019) was a huge melt year, when the equilibrium between adding and subtracting ice was most out of balance. If Earth starts to undergo more years like 2012, Greenland melt could trigger 30 inches of sea level rise, he said. Those two years seem extreme now, but years that look normal now would have been extreme 50 years ago, he said.

""That's how climate change works,"" Colgan said. ""Today's outliers become tomorrow's averages.""

Melanoma UK founder Gillian Nuttall said: ""I would expect much clearer advice to be given from our Deputy Prime Minister. ""To tell us to ‘enjoy’ the sunshine, without bothering to mention the dangers of overexposure, is wholly irresponsible."" According to the Telegraph, Dr Faisal Ali, a consultant dermatologist, said Mr Raab’s comments ""risk trivialising the immediate risk of sunburn and the recognised longer term risk of life-threatening skin cancers"". Temperatures on Monday are forecast to exceed 35C in some areas, with Peterborough expected to hit 37C and Milton Keynes, Norwich and Lincoln set to see temperatures of 36C. DON'T MISS
