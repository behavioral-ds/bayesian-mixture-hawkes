A group of children and young adults including Greta Thunberg have filed a class-action lawsuit against the Swedish state for failing to take adequate measures to stop climate change.

The lawsuit is part of an international wave of climate-related legal action, some of it targeting national governments.

It follows a high-profile case in the Netherlands, where the country's highest court ruled in 2019 that the government had a legal obligation to take action to mitigate global warming.

The Swedish suit involves Thunberg, possibly the world's best known climate activist, and more than 600 others who claim that Sweden's climate policies violate its constitution as well as the European Convention on Human Rights.

""The Swedish state fails to meet the constitutional requirement to promote sustainable development leading to a good environment for present and future generations,"" the group said in a statement.

In 2017, Sweden adopted a climate law that requires the government to work to reduce emissions of planet-warming gases toward a net-zero target set for 2045.

Cutting greenhouse gas emissions is key to meeting the 2015 Paris Agreement target of keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century.

However, Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February triggered a scramble for energy that's set back efforts and this year's U.N.-sponsored climate talks in Egypt failed to step up ambitions.

In an interview with Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter, Thunberg said she believes climate laws should be tightened.

""We don't have laws that provide long-term protection from the consequences of climate and environmental crises, but we need to use the methods at our disposal and do everything we can,"" she said.

The lawsuit, which has been in the works for two years, comes as the new Swedish government's policies on climate change face intense scrutiny.

The Cabinet, which assumed power following elections in September, has announced plans to scrap the environment ministry altogether. Its 2023 budget has been criticized for including measures that are set to increase emissions from the transport sector.

""The Swedish state has never treated the climate crisis as the crisis it is, and the new government has clearly signaled that it won't do that either,"" 20-year-old Anton Foley, who is formally the main plaintiff in the case, said in a statement.

The lawsuit, filed in Stockholm on Friday, urges the court to require that the government undertake its ""fair share"" of global measures to keep greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the Paris Agreements goals.

54858014-26c2-4a64-aa1b-474d2914f2d1,"In all the debates on how to curb climate change, hemp is hardly mentioned. Better known as cannabis, modern varieties of hemp are too weak to use as narcotics, but they are extremely efficient at absorbing and locking up carbon.



Hemp is one of the fastest-growing plants in the world and can grow 4 metres high in 100 days. Research suggests hemp is twice as effective as trees at absorbing and locking up carbon, with 1 hectare (2.5 acres) of hemp reckoned to absorb 8 to 22 tonnes of CO 2 a year, more than any woodland. The CO 2 is also permanently fixed in the hemp fibres, which can go on to be used for many commodities including textiles, medicines, insulation for buildings and concrete; BMW is even using it to replace plastics in various car parts.



But unlike many other countries, the UK still classifies industrial hemp as a controlled drug, and growing the plant needs a Home Office licence. Cultivation in Britain is only about 800 hectares but work at the University of York and Biorenewables Development Centre aims to increase this to 80,000 hectares and make hemp a leading UK crop."
50d5f238-6e97-4d6f-b083-8edba14685cd,"A team of scientists from Hudson Carbon, a research center in upstate New York that studies carbon storage, say cannabis could be the missing player in humanity’s fight against climate change. How? Hemp absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere more than twice as effectively as trees.

Although the U.S. only accounts for about five percent of the global population, it is responsible for 28 percent of the world’s carbon emissions, so it behooves us to take notice.

“Roughly speaking, if [the US] did 50 million acres of hemp, we would be sequestering a couple hundred million tons of carbon per year on that acreage,” said Ben Dobson, founder and president of Hudson Carbon.

Dobson is considered a pioneer in the carbon farming space. His farm in New York's Hudson Valley is a soil laboratory where researchers found that, while trees can capture about six tons of CO2 per year, hemp can suck up to 16 tons. CO2 also becomes permanently encased within hemp fibers, which can be used as raw material to manufacture a wide variety of products, ranging from textiles and construction to car parts to medicine.

Considering cotton alone, which represents 43% of all fibers used for clothing and textiles worldwide, hemp can provide enormous benefits in view of the vast difference in the water needed to grow hemp vs. cotton.

Hemp, or industrial hemp, is a subspecies of the cannabis plant but lacks most of marijuana’s psychoactive compound tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).

Fastest-Growing Plant On Earth

Another benefit of hemp includes the fact that it is one of the fastest-growing plants in the world, reaching four meters in height in only 100 days.

Besides purifying the air of greenhouse gases, cannabis plants can also absorb carcinogenic heavy metals such as mercury, lead or cadmium from soils – elements which, although suitable for crops used for food, are highly dangerous for people who consume these plants.

And Hemp Is Destined To Be Wildly Profitable

Industrial sales are expected to triple in the next 7 years, rising from $4.71 billion in 2019 to $15.26 billion in 2027.

Story continues

The work Dobson is doing now could lead to farmers getting paid for their practices and ability to sequester carbon.

Farmers, after all, are collectively responsible for 60% of the Earth’s surface and how it’s treated, according to Dobson.

“We’re really managing and stewarding over half the Earth’s surface,” he said. “We need to regenerate this Earth surface into a healthy ecosystem in order to assure a future for our children and mitigate the worst effects of climate change.”

725dd99b-6c13-4cec-be95-f2ce6eb14851,"The annual United Nations climate talks, known as the Conference of Parties (COP), have traditionally promised much but delivered little. This year’s COP27 was no different, with most observers noting that it even backtracked on commitments made at COP26 in Glasgow.

What was less observed was that the summit faced a major additional obstacle in 2022. This year, the climate crisis was overshadowed by the war in Ukraine which has been the foreign policy priority of the United States and the European Union since the beginning of Russia’s invasion in February.

The difference between the way the world’s richest countries responded to the Ukraine war and the carbon war on our whole planet is undoubtedly stark.

Since the beginning of Russia’s invasion, the US and its NATO allies provided Ukraine with military assistance worth more than $25bn, welcomed nearly seven million refugees, and willingly absorbed severe economic shocks caused by energy price increases triggered by the war.

Despite a global recession looming on the horizon, these countries did not hesitate to increase their military expenditure. Germany allocated 100 billion euros ($104bn) of its 2022 budget for the armed forces, for example, and the US House of Representatives approved a record $840bn military spending.

Yet at COP27, these same wealthiest nations were not even able to deliver the $100bn in climate finance that had been promised as far back as 2009 to the world’s most climate-vulnerable countries. A recent report co-published by the organisation I work for, the Transnational Institute, found that the richest countries spent $9.45 trillion on their militaries between 2013 and 2021 compared with an estimated $234bn on climate finance – in other words, they have spent 30 times as much on the military as climate finance.

After many years of pressure, at COP27, nations finally agreed to create a loss and damage mechanism to provide funds to impoverished countries suffering severe climate impacts, but it is so far just an empty pot. The accelerated arms race that has emerged since the Russian invasion and rising US-China tensions signal that filling that pot will not be a priority for most wealthy nations in the near future.

These spending choices matter not just because they are diverting resources from urgently needed climate action, but also because every dollar spent on the military is worsening the climate crisis. Most militaries consume significant amounts of fossil fuels. One estimate calculates that military emissions may make up 5.5 percent of global emissions. If the global military were a country, it would be the fourth biggest emitter in the world, ahead of Russia.

Furthermore, most of the world’s military spending goes towards the purchase of equipment and vehicles that are among the worst offenders when it comes to carbon emissions. In 2022 alone, for example, 475 new F-35 fighter jets, which use a whopping 5,600 litres (1,480 gallons) of oil per hour of flight, have been ordered. These fuel-guzzling planes could be flying for the next 30 years.

The emissions increase even further when war breaks out. The Ukrainian government at COP27 presented research showing that the first eight months of war had already led to 33 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions, equivalent to adding 16 million cars to the United Kingdom’s roads for two years.

US and UK military chiefs argue that they are committed to reducing military emissions, but their plans so far remain undetailed, opaque and unconvincing. Adding solar panels to a military base is easy to do, but does nothing to tackle the main challenge, which is fossil fuel consumption by military jets, ships and tanks. For now, there is no alternative, green fuel that can be produced at the scale needed and without triggering unacceptable social and environmental consequences, such as increased deforestation and the dispossession of Indigenous peoples.

The uncomfortable truth is that there is no way of ensuring that our planet remains habitable in the long term while continuing to increase military spending. In the midst of an intense and brutal war in Ukraine, this fact is too easily lost as governments are able to justify any increases in military spending to deal with the new immediate “threats”.

Moreover, the military spending of many rich countries is already way out of proportion to any real or perceived threat. NATO member states, for example, already spend 17 times as much on the military as Russia. The US spends more on its military than the next nine countries combined.

Meanwhile, the world has an ever smaller window to tackle climate change – the most pressing threat to our collective future. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says the world must cut emissions by 45 percent by 2030 to have any chance at keeping global average temperature increases below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). When every month counts, embarking on an accelerated arms race is the worst path the world’s most powerful nations can take. It diverts money and attention from urgent climate action, it increases emissions and it fuels conflicts at a time of increased climate instability.

Climate change can teach us a critical lesson about security. Carbon emissions do not recognise borders. It is not possible for any nation to shield itself from the effects of climate change using tanks or fighter jets. The only way to tackle the climate emergency is through global cooperation. Demilitarisation and peace are the best and perhaps the only ways to ensure that humanity has the capacity and resilience to respond to this crisis.

Only if the world’s leaders recognise that uniting to confront the threat of global heating is more important than any imperialist strategy or narrow economic interest, may we have a chance to avoid climate catastrophe. A secure nation in the end depends on a secure planet.

e570eb67-ffe0-45f6-b842-3512de319516,"In a historic ruling today, a Queensland court has said the massive Clive Palmer-owned Galilee Basin coal project should not go ahead because of its contribution to climate change, its environmental impacts, and because it would erode human rights.

The case was mounted in 2020 by a First Nations-led group of young people aged 13 to 30 called Youth Verdict. It was the first time human rights arguments were used in a climate change case in Australia.

The link between human rights and climate change is being increasingly recognised overseas. In September this year, for example, a United Nations committee decided that by failing to adequately address the climate crisis, Australia’s Coalition government violated the human rights of Torres Strait Islanders.

Youth Verdict’s success today builds on this momentum. It heralds a new era for climate change cases in Australia by youth activists, who have been frustrated with the absence of meaningful federal government policy.

Read more: Australia violated the rights of Torres Strait Islanders by failing to act on climate change, the UN says. Here's what that means

1.58 billion tonnes of emissions

The Waratah Coal mine operation proposes to extract up to 40 million tonnes of coal from the Galilee Basin each year, over the next 25 years. This would produce 1.58 billion tonnes of carbon emissions, and is four times more coal extraction than Adani’s operation.

While the project has already received approval at the federal government level, it also needs a state government mining lease and environmental authority to go ahead. Today, Queensland land court President Fleur Kingham has recommended to the state government that both entitlements be refused.

In making this recommendation, Kingham reflected on how the global landscape has changed since the Paris Agreement in 2015, and since the last major challenge to a mine in Queensland in 2016: Adani’s Carmichael mine.

She drew a clear link between the mining of this coal, its ultimate burning by a third party overseas, and the project’s material contribution to global emissions. She concluded that the project poses “unacceptable” climate change risks to people and property in Queensland.

The Queensland Human Rights Act requires a decision-maker to weigh up whether there is any justifiable reason for limiting a human right, which could incorporate a consideration of new jobs. Kingham decided the importance of preserving the human rights outweighed the potential A$2.5 billion of economic benefits of the proposed mine.

From a legal perspective, I believe there are four reasons in particular this case is so significant.

1. Rejecting an entrenched assumption

A major barrier to climate change litigation in Queensland has been the “market substitution assumption”, also known as the “perfect substitution argument”. This is the assertion that a particular mine’s contribution to climate change is net zero, because if that mine doesn’t supply coal, then another will.

Kingham rejected this argument. She noted that the economic benefits of the proposed project are uncertain with long-term global demand for thermal coal set to decline. She observed that there’s a real prospect the mine might not be viable for its projected life, rebutting the market substitution assumption.

This is an enormous victory for environmental litigants as this was a previously entrenched argument in Australia’s legal system and policy debate.

2. Evidence from First Nations people

It was also the first time the court took on-Country evidence from First Nations people in accordance with their traditional protocols. Kingham and legal counsel travelled to Gimuy (around Cairns) and Traditional Owners showed how climate change has directly harmed their Country.

As Youth Verdict co-director and First Nations lead Murrawah Johnson put it:

We are taking this case against Clive Palmer’s Waratah Coal mine because climate change threatens all of our futures. For First Nations peoples, climate change is taking away our connection to Country and robbing us of our cultures which are grounded in our relationship to our homelands. Climate change will prevent us from educating our young people in their responsibilities to protect Country and deny them their birth rights to their cultures, law, lands and waters.

This decision reflects the court’s deep engagement with First Nations’ arguments, in considering the impacts of climate change on First Nations people.

3. The human rights implications

In yet another Australian first, the court heard submissions on the human rights implications of the mine.

The Land Court of Queensland has a unique jurisdiction in these matters, because it makes a recommendation, rather than a final judgment. This recommendation must be taken into account by the final decision-makers – in this case, the Queensland resources minister, and the state Department of Environment and Science.

In an earlier proceeding, Kingham found the land court itself is subject to obligations under Queensland’s Human Rights Act. This means she must properly consider whether a decision to approve the mine would limit human rights and if so, whether limits to those human rights can be demonstrably justified.

Kingham found approving the mine would contribute to climate change impacts, which would limit:

the right to life

the cultural rights of First Nations peoples

the rights of children

the right to property and to privacy and home



the right to enjoy human rights equally.

Internationally, there are clear links made between climate change and human rights. For example, climate change is worsening heatwaves, risking a greater number of deaths, thereby affecting the right to life.

4. A victory for a nature refuge

Kingham also considered the environmental impacts of the proposed mine on the Bimblebox Nature Refuge – 8,000 hectares semi-arid woodland, home to a recorded 176 bird species, in the Galilee Basin.

She deemed these impacts unacceptable, as “the ecological values of Bimblebox [could be] seriously and possibly irreversibly damaged”.

She also observed that the costs of climate change to people in Queensland have not been fully accounted for, nor have the costs of mining on the Bimblebox Nature Refuge. Further, she found the mine would violate Bimblebox Alliance’s right to family and home.

Making history

This case has made legal history. It is the first time a Queensland court has recommended refusal of a coal mine on climate change grounds, and the first case linking human rights and climate change in Australia. As Kingham concluded:

Approving the application would risk disproportionate burdens for future generations, which does not give effect to the goal of intergenerational equity.

The future of the project remains unclear. But in a year marked by climate-related disasters, the land court’s decision offers a ray of hope that Queensland may start to leave coal in the ground.

9b231488-40f6-412c-839c-6317bdc47ed9,"To gain insight into the driving mechanisms that made the extreme PNW heatwave possible, we analysed meteorological data such as temperature, soil moisture, pressure and wind fields, investigating the interrelation of these variables during the event and over the past four decades. We also used climate model experiments to better understand the role of the land surface in catalysing simulated heatwaves in the PNW.

Our study revealed that the 2021 heatwave was amplified by a combination of processes (Fig. 1). Jet-stream waviness — a series of north–south wobbles in the jet stream encircling the Northern Hemisphere — and remote convective activity over the western Pacific contributed to the formation of an unprecedented atmospheric ridge over the northwest United States, demonstrating that atmospheric dynamics had a crucial role2. Additionally, it is likely that feedbacks between land surface dryness and near-surface heating contributed to some of the highest temperatures. In our model experiments, we found that in the PNW, the interaction of soil moisture with the overlying atmosphere can amplify hot months, increasing the likelihood of month-long high-temperature anomalies such as that seen in June 2021.

At the peak of the PNW heatwave, conditions departed sharply from well-established linear relationships between climate variables (Fig. 1a), which suggests that physical relationships between the variables may be modified under extreme conditions. Ongoing climate-change-driven trends in these variables have catalysed such nonlinear behaviour. More fundamentally, even gradual warming over recent decades has greatly increased the probability of such an extreme heatwave1 (Fig. 1b): we estimate that the PNW heatwave would have been nearly impossible a few decades ago, but is now a once-in-hundreds-of-years event, and is likely to become a once-a-decade event before 2070 under a moderate emissions scenario."

The heat wave that hammered western North America in late June and early July 2021 was not just any midsummer event. Over nine days, from British Columbia through Washington and Oregon and beyond, it exceeded average regional temperatures for the period by 10 degrees C (18 F), and on single days in some locales, by an astounding 30 C, or 54 F. Among many new daily records, it set a new national benchmark for all of Canada, at 121.3 F in Lytton, British Columbia. The next day, the entire town burned down amid an uncontrollable wildfire—one of many sparked by the hot, dry weather. Across the region, at least 1,400 people died from heat-related causes.

Within weeks, scientists blamed the event's extremity largely on climate change. Now, a new study in the journal Nature Climate Change affirms that conclusion, and for the first time comprehensively elucidates the multiple mechanisms—some strictly climate-related, others more in the realm of disastrous coincidences—that they say led to the mind-bending temperatures.

""It was so extreme, it's tempting to apply the label of a 'black swan' event, one that can't be predicted,"" said lead author Samuel Bartusek, a Ph.D. student at the Columbia Climate School's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. ""But there's a boundary between the totally unpredictable, the plausible, and the totally expected that's hard to categorize. I would call this more of gray swan.""

The study pulled climate data starting in the 1950s together with daily weather observations from the weeks preceding and during the heat wave to form an intimate portrait. A core conclusion: Such an event would have been virtually impossible absent human-induced warming. It was impossible in the 1950s, but atmospheric warming since then has moved the needle to a prospective 1-in-200-year event—still rare, but now feasible. The researchers predicts that if warming continues at even a moderate pace, such heat waves could hit the region about every 10 years by 2050.

Average global temperatures have risen less than 2 degrees F in the last century. But small upward increments may shift interactions between atmosphere and land in ways that drive chances of extreme temperature spikes far beyond just the average temperature rise. Boiled down to the simplest terms, the study says much of the 2021 heat wave arose from the multiplying effects of higher overall temperatures, including drying of soils in some areas. Additionally, about a third of the heat wave came from what the researchers call ""nonlinear"" forces—short-term weather patterns that helped lock in the heat that may also have been amplified by changing climate.

One major driver, they say, was a disruption of the jet stream, which normally carries air west to east across the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes along a more or less circular path. Preceding the heat wave, though, the jet stream stalled and bent into huge waves, with four north-south peaks and troughs. These concentrated high-pressure systems underneath each peak; high pressure compresses air more and more as it approaches the surface, and this generates heat. One of those systems settled on western North America, then stayed there there day after day, creating what meteorologists call a ""heat dome.""

Some scientists believe big jet-stream waves are becoming more frequent and extreme due to human-induced warming. The jet stream normally forms a boundary between frigid polar air and warmer southern air, but recent outsize warming in the Arctic is breaking down the temperature difference, destabilizing the system, they say. This idea is still being debated. That said, part of the groundwork for the new study was laid by coauthor Kai Kornhuber, who published a 2019 study identifying such meanders as threats to world food security should they hit multiple major agricultural regions simultaneously. In 2021, concurrent major heat waves tied to the meanders hit not just North America, but within a dome spanning much of Scandinavia, Eastern Europe, western Russia and the Caucasus; and another over northwestern Siberia.

Western North America's was by far the worst. One factor, the authors say, was a series of smaller-scale atmospheric waves generated in the western Pacific Ocean. These moved east, and upon hitting land, latched onto the larger jet-stream wave and amplified it. Meteorologists could see these patterns coming some 10 days out, and thus accurately warned of the heat wave well in advance.

A longer-term key factor, the researchers say, is climate-driven drying that has overtaken much of the U.S. and Canadian west in recent decades, reducing soil-moisture levels in many areas. During the heat wave, that meant reduced evaporation of water from vegetation that previously would have helped counteract heating of the air near the surface. With less evaporation, in some places the surface more effectively heated the air above it. Indeed, the researchers found that the heat wave was most extreme in areas with the driest soils.

""Global warming is gradually making the Pacific Northwest drier,"" said study coauthor Mingfang Ting, a Lamont-Doherty professor, pushing it into a long-term state where such extreme events are becoming ever more likely.

Extraordinary heat and drought continue to affect the region. In mid-October of this year, many daily temperature records were shattered with spikes more characteristic of high summer than mid-autumn. These included 88 degrees in Seattle on Oct. 16—a full 16 degrees above the previous daily record. The same day, there were records in Vancouver (86); Olympia, Wash. (85); and Portland, Ore. (86), its fifth consecutive day in the 80s. The hot, dry weather has sparked forest fires so fierce and widespread that on Oct. 20, smoke caused Seattle to see the worst air quality of any big city in the world, ahead of usual favorites like Beijing and Delhi.

""We can certainly expect more hot periods in this area and other areas, just due to the increase in global temperatures, and the way it shifts the probability of extreme events by huge amounts,"" said Bartusek.

In 1992, the United Nations classified China as a developing country, as hundreds of millions of its citizens lived in poverty. A lot has changed since then: China is now the world’s second-largest economy and the biggest annual emitter of planet-warming greenhouse gases. Average Chinese today are 34 times richer and nearly four times more polluting. But the classification has stayed the same for the past three decades, frustrating diplomats from developed nations who say it has allowed Beijing to avoid paying its fair share to help poor countries cope with the ravages of climate change.

The debate over what China owes to countries that are least responsible for global warming — but most harmed by its effects — has dramatically intensified in the wake of the recent U.N. Climate Change Conference in Egypt. At the end of the two-week summit, known as COP27, negotiators from nearly 200 nations agreed to establish a fund to compensate vulnerable countries for the costs of addressing rising seas, stronger storms and other effects of a warming world.

Analysts say it is unlikely that China will pay into the fund, despite the country’s rapidly rising contribution to the greenhouse gases heating the planet.

“The facts are clear: China is the largest emitter in the world now,” said Li Shuo, a senior policy adviser at Greenpeace East Asia. “So it is a very valid question to talk about growing responsibility from China on the international stage.”

The question is a politically sensitive one. Beijing policymakers bristle at the suggestion that China should be considered a developed nation, pointing to pockets of extreme poverty that persist across the country. They also highlight the obligations of the United States, which has pumped more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than any other nation in history, even as China surpasses America in terms of annual carbon dioxide emissions. (America also has far higher per capita emissions than China.)

“Developed countries, including the United States, must shoulder more responsibilities,” Liu Pengyu, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said in an email. “This is not moral but with reason. From mid-18th century to 1950, developed countries accounted for 95 percent of all the carbon dioxide released.”

Liu added that developed countries have still not followed through on their 2009 pledge to provide $100 billion annually to help developing countries transition to greener economies and adapt to mounting climate disasters. In 2020, rich countries fell nearly $20 billion short of what they had promised.

“China still stands with developing countries on this funding issue,” said Byford Tsang, a senior policy adviser at the international climate think tank E3G. “Richer developed nations have made it easy for China to take that position because they haven’t been fulfilling their pledge on climate finance that was made more than a decade ago.”

Tsang added that he does not expect China to try to take money from the new fund aimed at helping vulnerable countries cope with the irreversible effects of global warming — known as “loss and damage” in the parlance of U.N. climate negotiations.

“I don’t think Beijing policymakers are taking the position that they should be on the receiving end of the loss and damage financing,” he said, noting that the fund is reserved for the most vulnerable countries, such as island nations that face an existential threat from rising seas.

Chinese officials have not officially said whether they will contribute to the fund. When asked about the issue at COP27, Chinese climate envoy Xie Zhenhua said: “China strongly supports the claims of developing and vulnerable countries for ‘loss and damage.’ China is also a developing country, and this year climate disasters have also brought huge losses to China. We sympathize with the suffering of developing countries and fully support their demands.”

Xie added that although it “is not our responsibility,” China has provided 2 billion yuan ($280 million) to help developing countries cut emissions and adapt to global warming through a separate South-South Climate Cooperation Fund.

Analysts said it appears unlikely that Beijing officials would send climate aid through U.N. channels or commit to more aggressive pledges when they are under pressure at home to address an economic slowdown caused in part by China’s strict “zero covid” policy and a property market downturn. In response to an energy shortage last year, China has approved a huge buildup of coal capacity.

Lauri Myllyvirta, a researcher at the Helsinki-based Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air, said paying into the fund could set an unwelcome precedent for Chinese policymakers, forcing them to take on more responsibility within the U.N. system.

“It would be tantamount to accepting developed country responsibility, and that has always been a red line for China,” he said.

While American diplomats agreed to establish the fund for loss and damage, reversing long-standing U.S. resistance to the idea, there is no guarantee that Congress will appropriate the money. Last year, President Biden requested $2.5 billion for international climate finance but secured just $1 billion, and that was when Democrats controlled both chambers.

This year, Biden has asked for a record $11.4 billion. But Republicans, who generally oppose climate aid, are poised to take control of the House in January, further dampening the prospects for the funding.

“The idea that we owe developing countries some sort of climate reparations is absurd,” Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said in an interview. “If anything, we could send them a bill for all the things we’ve done over the decades on their behalf.”

Cramer called on U.S. climate envoy John F. Kerry to ensure that Beijing contributes money to the effort. “I would think that if John F. Kerry had any patriotism whatsoever while negotiating this nonsense, he would insist that China pay in,” he said.

Asked for comment, Kerry spokeswoman Whitney Smith pointed to a previously released statement that said the United States will “continue to press major emitters like China to significantly enhance” their climate ambitions but did not specifically address whether it would push China to pay for climate damages.

During the COP27 negotiations, the European Union tried to split China from other developing nations by offering to pay into a fund for the most vulnerable countries — so long as big emitters like Beijing were included as potential donors and ruled out as potential recipients.

“We call it 1992 world versus 2022,” said one European negotiator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.

In the final hours of the talks, negotiators compromised, agreeing to prioritize the most vulnerable countries and allowing China to contribute — but only if it wants to.

At past U.N. climate summits, China has allied itself with a group of more than 100 developing countries that have pressed the rich world for more financial assistance. Leading this push at COP27 was Pakistan, one of China’s closest diplomatic partners, which is relying heavily on Chinese investment for its energy transition. Pakistan, historically responsible for less than 1 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, was devastated this summer by catastrophic flooding that killed nearly 1,500 people and caused more than $40 billion in damage. Scientists have said the flooding was supercharged by climate change.

The United Nations defines developing countries as those with a relatively low standard of living, a smaller industrial base and lower indicators such as average life expectancy, education and per capita income.

While developing countries negotiate as a large group at U.N. climate conferences, they often have vastly different interests. Saudi Arabia, which is still considered a developing country despite its wealth from its oil reserves, has sought to scrap language in U.N. climate agreements calling for phasing out fossil fuels. Meanwhile, the tiny island nation of Vanuatu — which could be swallowed by rising seas — has fought to include language calling for rapid emissions reductions.

For some countries, the mismatch is sustainable so long as China is willing to use its weight to advocate for the interests of those more vulnerable.

“China has always stood by the interests of the developing countries,” said Malik Amin Aslam, who until earlier this year was Pakistan’s minister of climate change. “That is different from the developed world.”

He said that from his perspective, it is more important that China advocate for assistance from richer nations than contribute its own cash. “I don’t see China as the big villain here,” he said.

Other policymakers feel differently.

“They are always seeking language that would protect them, give them less responsibilities, no obligations for developing countries,” said a former climate diplomat from a coastal developing nation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid retaliation from Beijing. “That firewall between developed and developing [has] protected them.”

Ultimately, any future move by the United Nations to reclassify China as a developed country would need the unanimous consent of nearly 200 nations. An objection from one country could derail the entire effort.

“It is a political nonstarter,” said Li of Greenpeace. “We will never be able to recategorize.”

Transportation Dept. approves oil export terminal in gulf despite climate concerns

The Transportation Department’s Maritime Administration on Tuesday gave the green light to a proposed oil export terminal in the Gulf of Mexico despite environmental and public health concerns, Politico’s Joshua Siegel reports.

Advertisement

The Sea Port Oil Terminal off Freeport, Tex., would allow companies to ship about 2 million barrels of oil abroad per day through 50 miles of new pipeline. Environmentalists and residents had urged Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to reject the terminal, saying its emissions would undermine President Biden’s climate agenda and further burden environmental justice communities.

In July, the maritime office released a final environmental impact statement that found oil processed at the terminal would generate planet-warming emissions equal to 233 million tons of carbon dioxide each year.

A spokesman for Enterprise, which is jointly developing the project with Enbridge and Chevron, said the company is “pleased” with the approval and still assessing the construction timeline. The Transportation Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Labor Dept. finalizes rule on climate-friendly funds for retirement plans

The Labor Department on Tuesday finalized a rule that makes it easier for employers to consider climate change and other environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors when choosing investment funds for their 401(k) plans, Greg Iacurci reports for CNBC.

The rule, which will take effect in 60 days, undoes regulations put in place by the Trump administration that made it difficult for businesses to weigh ESG factors when selecting 401(k) funds, senior Labor Department officials said during a Tuesday call with reporters.

Lisa Gomez, assistant secretary of labor for the Employee Benefits Security Administration, called the new rule “common sense.”

“While climate change is a critical issue, that’s not [just] what this rule is about,” Gomez said.

U.S. and allies near deal on Russian oil price cap

The United States and its allies are expected to reach an agreement as soon as Wednesday for a price cap on Russian oil that could be set at $60 a barrel, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private talks, Laurence Norman and Andrew Buehren report for the Wall Street Journal.

A plan by the Group of Seven nations and Australia to cap the price of Russian oil will take effect on Dec. 5, while the European Union is set to ban Russian crude imports starting on the same date. The plans are aimed at hurting Moscow’s economy amid its ongoing war in Ukraine by banning shipments of Russian oil unless it is sold below a certain price.

Also on Tuesday, the Treasury Department issued guidance for complying with the cap that says shippers will not be financially penalized for transporting Russian oil that was loaded and shipped before 12:01 a.m. Eastern on Dec. 5 and unloaded at the destination port before 12:01 a.m. Eastern on Jan. 19, Chelsey Cox reports for CNBC.

Biden administration unveils environmental justice screening tool

The White House Council on Environmental Quality on Tuesday released a screening tool to identify disadvantaged communities as part of the Biden administration’s Justice40 Initiative, which seeks to deliver 40 percent of the benefits of all federal climate and clean energy investments to communities overburdened by environmental hazards.

The Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool does not include race as a factor for identifying disadvantaged communities, as administration officials reportedly worried that using race would make the tool vulnerable to legal challenges.

The White House did, however, make two notable changes since the beta version of the tool was released in February: It mentions historical redlining as an indicator of marginalized neighborhoods, and it includes federally recognized tribal nations.

The recent COP27 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Egypt ended with an agreement in which wealthier countries, including the United States, would pay into a ""loss and damage"" fund to support less wealthy nations that are being battered by the effects of climate change. Notably, however, the world’s second-largest economy, China, has been able to avoid having to pay into the fund. That's a problem because China is the world’s biggest polluter.

China’s negative impact on global climate policy cannot be overstated. One need only look to Africa, where Chinese investment through the Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, is driven by debt-trap diplomacy. A prime example of China’s recklessness can be found in Kenya, where recently revealed details of a 2014 secret railway contract show that the $4.7 billion railway project was over budget at Kenya's expense. Judges ultimately declared the deal illegal for not being in alignment with Kenyan procurement laws. It is doubtful that concerns over environmental damage were ever considered in the structuring of this project.

DEMANDS FOR 'CLIMATE REPARATIONS' ARE LAUGHABLE

Top line: China has demonstrated time and time again that it wants all the trappings and benefits that come with being considered a superpower and none of the responsibilities. According to the World Wildlife Fund, ""BRI corridors overlap with the range of 265 threatened species."" The Chinese Communist Party’s attempts to present BRI as environmentally responsible are disingenuous and a blatant example of ""greenwashing.""

The world faces many urgent and long-term challenges. But confronting climate change is of utmost importance. International forums such as COP27 are essential in fostering dialogue and cooperation toward a better future. It will be a terrible shame if China is able to skirt its international responsibilities at the very moment that the world’s biggest polluter needs to change its ways. The world must demand that China pay into the climate support fund.

9396deff-62f9-4e5b-8acb-5568994aea15,"In the late 1920s, a young working-class boy nicknamed Ritty spent most of his time tinkering in his ""laboratory"" at his parents' home in Rockaway, New York.

His lab was an old wooden packing box, equipped with shelves that contained a storage battery and an electric circuit of light bulbs, switches and resistors. One of his proudest inventions was a homemade burglar alarm that alerted him whenever his parents entered his room. He used a microscope to study the natural world and he would sometimes take his chemistry set into the street to perform tricks for other children.

Ritty's early academic record was unremarkable. He struggled with literature and foreign languages, while, in an IQ test taken as a child, he reportedly scored around 125, which is above average but by no means genius territory. As an adolescent, however, he showed a flair for mathematics and started teaching himself from elementary textbooks. By the end of high school, Ritty reached the top place in a state-wide annual maths competition.

The rest is history. You might know Ritty as the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman, whose new theory of quantum electrodynamics revolutionised the study of subatomic particles.

Other scientists found the workings of Feynman's mind to be unfathomable. To his peers, he appeared to have an almost supernatural talent, leading the Polish-American mathematician Mark Kac to declare in his autobiography that Feynman was not just an ordinary genius, but ""a magician of the highest calibre"".

Can modern psychology help us to decode that magic and to understand the makings of genius more generally?

You might also like:

Simply defining the term is a headache: there is no obvious objective criteria. But most definitions identify genius with exceptional achievement in at least one domain, with originality and flair that is recognised by other experts in the same discipline and which may spur many more advances.

Identifying the origins of genius, and the best means of cultivating it, has been an even harder task. Is it the product of a high general intelligence? Limitless curiosity? Grit and determination? Or is it the lucky combination of fortunate circumstances that are impossible to recreate artificially? Research on the lives of exceptional individuals – including studies of Nobel Prize winners such as Richard Feynman – can provide some clues.

The Termites

Let's begin with the Genetic Studies of Genius, a hugely ambitious project led by Lewis Terman, a psychologist based at the Stanford Graduate School of Education in the early 20th Century.

Terman was an early pioneer of the IQ test, translating and adapting a French measure of children's academic aptitude developed in the late 19th Century. The questions looked at a range of different abilities, such as vocabulary, mathematics and logical reasoning, which were, together, assumed to represent someone's capacity for learning and abstract thinking. Terman then created tables of the average scores for each year group – against which he could compare any child's results to identify their mental age. The IQ score was then calculated by dividing the mental age by the chronological age and multiplying this ratio by 100.



A 10-year-old who scored the same as the average 15-year-old would have an IQ of 150, for example. A 10-year-old who reasoned like a nine-year-old would have an IQ of 90."

Since he purchased his 311-acre property in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, in 1998, John Allaire has watched 60 acres of it disappear. He has witnessed a series of climate disasters rapidly wash away Louisiana’s coastline, devastating already-overlooked communities like his.

In 2005, he lost his home to Hurricane Rita. He applied for federal assistance to rebuild his home but was rejected. Instead, he was compensated with a temporary trailer, which he then lost to Hurricane Ike in 2008. He has been moving between Texas and Lafayette, Louisiana, for work since then.

Climate events like these are becoming more frequent and higher in magnitude across the U.S. Gulf and Coastal South, and they’re displacing more and more people—especially BIPOC folks, who have been disproportionately affected by climate change across the globe.

“We have to acknowledge that disaster outcomes exacerbate sociopolitical inequalities,” says Sara McTarnaghan, senior research associate at Metropolitan Housing and Communities Policy Center at the Urban Institute. Underserved communities are already at a disadvantage from the inception of a climate event, and the institutions set up to provide relief often aren’t accessible or relevant to their particular needs.

In the aftermath of the 2020 Hurricanes Laura and Delta, for example, Allaire says the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) came and did an assessment but offered no direct relief. “It was all community organizations,” Allaire says.

In 2021, 59.1 million people were internally displaced worldwide by the climate crisis, and there will be more than 200 million climate migrants by 2050. Yet institutionalized protections for climate-displaced people are not guaranteed.

In the U.S., the national apparatuses for disaster and displacement management—the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Housing and Urban Development—are marred by discrimination scandals and perpetually stuck in the dysfunctional dynamics of determining the jurisdictions of state versus federal government. Globally, climate migrants can’t be granted asylum and have no legal protections under international law.

Operating outside the limitations of these institutions, community organizers are tackling climate displacement from all angles—advocating for climate-displaced people, providing them with resources, and making their communities more climate-resilient.

The Limits of Institutional Support

Right before Hurricane Ida struck his community in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana, in 2021, Justin Fitch of the United Houma Nation—the largest state-recognized tribe in Louisiana—made the decision to stay in his home with his wife, and used the family’s funds to have their children stay in Texas, away from the storm.

Fitch is an activist who works for the nonprofit Healthy Gulf and says that those hit hardest by climate disasters and who most need to leave are usually BIPOC like him. “People do not have an extra $4,000, $5,000 to leave,” Fitch says. “That’s the reason I didn’t leave.”

In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, Fitch says residents turned to groups like Gulf South Rising and The Gulf Coast Center for Law & Policy (now Taproot Earth) for help. Mutual aid can help mitigate some of the financial stress that affects homeowners dealing with buyouts, or help unhoused people who have lost access to shelters and resource centers impacted by climate events. Hotel assistance, for example, can provide a person with a few days of shelter, but it requires an application and is often an outright cost to be reimbursed later. That makes this option out of reach for many.

To combat this exclusion, Roishetta Ozane has been helping temporarily shelter people in disaster-prone areas. Her organization, The Vessel Project of Louisiana, put an estimated 300 people in hotels across Louisiana, Texas, and Mississippi during the winter storm in 2021.

“I started Vessel because I realized a lot of organizations had a lot of red tape,” Ozane says.

Instead, her organization meets folks where they’re at: no demands for documents or proof. It works to provide emergency shelter, food, oxygen tanks, and document recovery. It even helps folks apply for more traditional forms of aid.

In her work, Ozane has assisted undocumented people, unhoused people, and other marginalized folks who are sidelined by restrictive assistance. Her no-questions-asked policy is key to establishing trust while providing support.

The approach is based on her own experience: Faced with a series of climate events and the pandemic, Ozane struggled to support herself and her children after their home became unlivable in the aftermath of Hurricane Laura in 2020. She tried to obtain a mobile trailer from FEMA but didn’t receive it until a year later. So she knows how hard it can be and how individualized the struggles are.

“I can’t tell you what’s an emergency to you,” Ozane says.

Around 7,500 people in Louisiana live in FEMA’s interim mobile shelters, many of whom have received temporary housing assistance since 2021. Some people are there because they have nowhere to go, others because they were renters before the storms, and still others are facing an unstable housing market that is particularly tumultuous in a climate-unstable environment.

Others are awaiting assistance to rebuild or relocate. Those who choose to relocate may find themselves in an endless web of insurance companies, lawyers, government officials, and protocols. FEMA runs buyout programs that allow residents in disaster-prone areas (particularly flooding) to sell their homes to the government and relocate to areas with lower risk.

Buyouts can be risky, they require extensive paperwork, the requirements are inaccessible for many, and there’s no guarantee of success. The median wait time from the aftermath of the disaster to the completion of the buyout can be as long as five years. And oftentimes, people are pursuing buyouts for uninhabitable homes, which means this effort is on top of finding a place to live.

Other residents are shut out of traditional systems altogether, including homeowners without insurance, homeowners with heirs’ property, renters, and undocumented folks. These populations don’t typically have access to a dignified move that utilizes traditional modes of assistance, though their immediate needs are still ever-present.

Thirteen months after Ida made landfall, Fitch says, “I still have friends and family that are homeless, living in FEMA trailers.”

Lacking a Legal Framework

While folks in climate-unstable areas are making decisions in reaction to climate change, “climate change might not be how people conceive of their experience,” says Ama Francis, climate displacement project strategist for the International Refugee Assistance Project, “even as they are experiencing climate change.”

In many parts of the world, people still don’t consider their negative climate experiences as catalysts for their migration. Unfortunately, neither does the law.

“One of the constraints that I work with is that people need to fit into frameworks to access a legal benefit,” Francis says. “We have asylum law, for example, and for that framework, you have to experience harm or persecution from a human.”

Currently, there is no legal framework that denotes climate change as a driver for migration. Not only does this make a pathway to asylum for climate migrants cumbersome, but it also creates difficulties for climate migrants trying to receive resettlement assistance.

Part of systemic advocacy like Francis’ is to bring awareness to this fact. So, while the International Refugee Assistance Project champions the expansion of temporary protected status, new Department of Justice opinions, and other legal recompenses to help climate migrants, the organization is also working to document the experiences of those displaced by climate change and sociopolitical events surrounding it. These stories can then inform policy recommendations.

For this reason, equitable access to climate education is imperative to address climate displacement. It enables people to correlate their experiences in the larger context of the global issue. In the context of the U.S. South (and the Global South at large), anti-climate-change propaganda is rampant, even as these communities are impacted by its effects.

Resource extraction and manufacturing put food on the table. Talk of climate change signals a possible disruption to even basic needs being met, especially to those who don’t speak the “highfalutin language” in which these issues are explained in policies.

“That’s the case in impoverished communities that have been exploited,” Rev. Michael Malcom of The People’s Justice Council explains. “They just want to get out of [poverty].”

Speaking to folks’ priorities is the best way to get people to engage with climate change as a concept. Local southern organizations, like the Partnership for Southern Equity, are running programs to combat the effects of the climate crisis on public health, focusing on communities that have been excluded from equitable access to health care. The People’s Justice Council promotes solar buybacks and weatherization programs, and the Athens Land Trust’s invasive-plant removal program has encouraged buy-in from communities. The programs are economically advantageous while making people environmentally conscious.

Organizers are already seeing the benefits of climate education in their efforts to mobilize communities: The People’s Justice Council received an estimated 90,000 signatures on its “No Dirty Deals” collaborative petition to reject the contradictory climate actions in the Inflation Reduction Act that it says would disproportionately impact already marginalized communities.

Standing With Community

After Hurricane Ike destroyed John Allaire’s FEMA trailer in 2008, he was lucky enough to have the means to relocate temporarily. Since 2020, John has returned and is working toward building a home on his property in Cameron. Allaire talks of the good life he and his family have there, close to nature and his community of friends—a community he refuses to give up on.

Discussions on climate displacement often focus on the simple facts of who leaves or stays, and they exclude the real connections people have to their homes—their ties to the land, their livelihoods, and their communities. The overarching goal of efforts to address climate displacement, therefore, should be to provide a range of possible solutions: solutions to curb climate change, solutions to help facilitate safe and dignified migration, and solutions to support those who stay in climate-unstable areas.

“Some people do need to move, and we want to facilitate and ensure that people do so with dignity,” Francis says. “For some people, the right to stay is important, and we need to support that as well.”

In case you’re keeping track, last week the Biden administration did something else they said they’d never do. But succumbing to pressure from Europe is expected when abdicating American leadership. Our jet-setting climate czar, John Kerry, agreed on your behalf, at a meeting of folks who specialize in bilking America, to create what amounts to a climate reparations fund.

The fund is intended to compensate those nations in the developing world that have allegedly suffered the ill effects of global climate change because of productive Western economies. It seems that punishing success is more than a domestic political trend.

With Europe’s climate cultists now in the driver’s seat of U.S. policy, Americans will potentially be funneling money into countries known for brutality, corruption and mismanagement — all in the name of apologizing for our free-market economy and republican form of government.

The insanity of it all is plain. Government failure in the Third World is a long-standing, self-inflicted wound on humanity by phony democracies and dictators that have used essential services as weapons. They’ve intentionally withheld funding for water treatment, waste management, sewage systems, water purification, crop irrigation and other basic infrastructure needs that would improve the natural environment and human health.

Nations are responsible for their own environmental conditions that affect the health of their citizens far more than any marginal rise in temperatures could do. The Biden administration, however, is now on record saying Americans should be held liable for smog, devastating droughts, crop failures and famine in developing nations.

It’s victimization culture on steroids driven by Europe’s left-wing climate cultists. It’s a marrying of climate change fanaticism, globalization and reparations lunacy. The United States and its allies need to reject this position forcefully or it will continue to weaken the West’s ability to counter an ascendant Communist China.

Of course China, which emits some 66% more CO2 than the U.S. and Europe combined, will have no part in this scheme, again leaving U.S. taxpayers on the hook for nonsensical global policy that is anything but global. In addition, the nations where China has invested billions over the last decade that now suffer at the hands of their debt trap diplomacy and continuing deplorable conditions could now likely benefit from U.S. tax dollars, even though the CCP has enormous influence over their governments and economies.

In the vein of never letting a little common sense get in the way of climate change hysterics, President Biden will likely now try to plow billions of dollars into other nations through an alphabet soup of multilateral organizations.

Legitimizing the concept of reparations internationally in this way could also lend legitimacy to the left’s efforts to champion reparations domestically. Mainstreaming universal basic income and slavery reparations continue to be key goals of the American left. Now that the midterms are over, expect those favorite leftist social experiments to rear their ugly heads again, particularly in blue states and cities. The Biden administration’s decision to pay for alleged “climate wrongs” perpetrated by America will give domestic reparations activists political cover.

Mr. Biden’s latest capitulation will allow the climate cultists to achieve further global redistribution, but perhaps more importantly institutionalize the concept that the West has victimized nations. This flies in the face of the basic fact that Western free-market capitalism has provided more innovation, freedom and economic opportunity to more people in more places than any other system in history. Those nations and their people that became a part of that success have benefited from better health and natural environments.

Climate profiteers and their naive zealots in the activist community have driven Europe into an energy crisis that is making them vulnerable to aggressors like China and Russia and sinking their economies.

Here in the U.S., the Biden administration continues to follow their lead. Just last week the president suggested that if your heating bills are too high, get solar panels. Between now and 2030, the climate activists in our government are looking to eliminate between 10% and 20% of capacity from our electrical grid while replacing only a fraction of it with less reliable systems.

House Republicans and all Americans concerned about inflation need to send a message to the administration that they will fight — by whatever means necessary — any effort to prevent more of our money from feeding this global cabal that has no hope of changing the climate.

Rep. Andy Biggs Would Reject Biden ‘Climate Reparations’ Deal as Speaker. Would McCarthy?

Deal is 'purely hypocrisy,' says energy expert

Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) opposes the Biden administration’s ‘climate reparations’ commitment to climate losses and damages, made on Nov. 19 during last-minute negotiations at the United Nations climate summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt.

Yet, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

Both Biggs and McCarthy want to be Speaker of the House of Representatives in the upcoming Congress. While McCarthy beat Biggs in a Nov. 15 internal vote among House Republicans, he still needs to earn 218 votes in a House floor vote on Jan. 3 to become speaker. He garnered just 188 votes in the Nov. 15 contest, suggesting he still has a way to go before securing the leadership role.

“The congressman does not support climate reparations—they’re nonsense. This is not a priority for him, nor will it be,” said Matt Tragesser, communications director for Biggs, in a Nov. 21 email to The Epoch Times.

In response to questions about how, specifically, Biggs would put a stop to the financial commitment as speaker, Tragesser pointed to Congress’s authority over the budget.

“Since Republicans will have the majority in the House, it’ll be tough sledding for the admin,” he said.

The latest U.N. climate deal sets the stage for a “losses and damages” fund, benefiting countries alleged to have been harmed by man-made climate change. The Wall Street Journal editorial board and other critics have described the arrangement as “climate reparations.”

The details of the funding mechanism will be finalized at next year’s U.N. climate conference, which will be held in Dubai.

“This COP [Conference of the Parties] has taken an important step towards justice. I welcome the decision to establish a loss and damage fund and to operationalize it in the coming period,” said U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, the former leader of Socialist International.

The Biden administration’s Special Climate Envoy John Kerry previously vacillated on a climate losses and damages fund.

“It’s a well known fact that the United States and many other countries will not establish … some sort of legal structure that is tied to compensation or liability. That’s just not happening,” Kerry said on Nov. 12, as reported by Reuters.

Yet in a Nov. 20 statement, Kerry said the U.S. was “pleased” to be part of “a decision to establish funding arrangements related to loss and damage, including a fund as part of what many are calling a ‘mosaic’ of responses.”

E&E News reported that Kerry said he “welcomes” such a fund.

“There is no liability or compensation in the agreement for this fund,” said a State Department spokesperson.

Between Nov. 12 and this past weekend, it became clear that Republicans would take control of the House. That means they can exercise significant influence on any spending directed to the climate losses and damages fund.

The Epoch Times reached out to the State Department to see if the Biden administration’s shifting stance has anything to do with that development.

Energy Expert: ‘It’s Purely Hypocrisy’

Kevin Dayaratna, a senior research fellow in The Heritage Foundation’s Center for Data Analysis, told The Epoch Times that the latest U.N. climate deal is exceptionally hypocritical.

“What we’re seeing is a loss-damage fund for developing countries, for so-called damage associated with climate change, and the deal is, the plans are absolutely backwards. They’re actively discouraging the use of fossil fuels. And it’s purely hypocrisy because these developed countries, these wealthy countries, have acquired their wealth due to fossil fuels,” he said during a Nov. 22 interview.

Dayaratna’s research has shown that the most expensive and aggressive climate policies appear to have little environmental upside.

In one recent report, he sought to calculate the costs of implementing Biden’s climate agenda. He found that a carbon tax would lead to the loss of more than a million U.S. jobs while curtailing the country’s gross domestic product over 18 years by $7.7 billion.

“Eliminating all U.S. emissions would reduce global temperatures by less than 0.2 degrees Celsius by 2100—wrecking the economy for a negligible climate benefit,” the report concluded.

“I think it’s becoming clear that there’s a lot of uncertainty regarding the climate alarmist policy agenda, where fossil fuels are actively discouraged and alternative forms of energy seem to be actively propped up,” Dayaratna told The Epoch Times.

“These policies are not going to meaningfully impact the climate either way.”"

John Kerry, the U.S. special envoy for climate change, had the correct position heading into the 2022 U.N. Climate Change Conference of the Parties.

“It’s a well-known fact that the United States and many other countries will not establish some sort of legal structure that is tied to compensation or liability,” Kerry said before the conference. “That’s just not happening.”

UN CLIMATE CONFERENCE SKETCHES TENTATIVE AGREEMENT TO FUND CLIMATE ENDANGERED COUNTRIES

But then it did.

Desperate to avoid headlines announcing yet another Biden administration failure, Kerry agreed to the creation of a fund, administered by U.N. bureaucrats, that would transfer wealth from industrialized countries like the United States to developing countries that claim they have suffered damage from climate change.

Kerry was right the first time. The Biden administration’s cave will do nothing to stop climate change, but it will needlessly expose U.S. taxpayers to frivolous legal liabilities.

There are many problems with starting a new climate change fund that will allegedly benefit developing countries, but the most obvious is that we already have one. The United Nations previously established the Green Climate Fund during the 2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference. Theoretically, wealthy nations are supposed to be committing $100 billion a year to this organization. Instead, only $10 billion has been pledged so far. The Obama administration pledged $3 billion but only gave $1 billion to the fund before it left office. The Biden administration has only secured another $1 billion so far. Former President Donald Trump gave the fund nothing.

So why are international climate bureaucrats creating a new climate fund when the first one has fallen so woefully short of its goals?

At least the Green Climate Fund had a worthwhile goal — to help developing countries adopt more efficient energy technologies and adapt to climate change. It would be progress to spend money on projects that actually accomplish these goals.

This cannot be said of a fund based on giving developing nations more money for damage they claim was caused by climate change, which is a terrible idea. It creates perverse incentives that will increase economic damage and get more people killed.

Consider Pakistan, one of the biggest proponents of the new climate reparations fund, which has tried to claim recent flooding is a result of climate change. “This all happened despite our very low carbon footprint,"" Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif told conference attendees, “and yet we became a victim of something with which we had nothing to do.”

Nothing to do? Really?

Pakistan’s government has encouraged a policy of extreme deforestation to the point that only 5% of the nation's land is now covered by forest. The government has also allowed farmers to cultivate much-needed flood plains that would have mitigated intense rains. It is these non-climate-related policy decisions that made Pakistan so vulnerable to heavy rainstorms. Pakistani policy had everything to do with its own country getting flooded, yet Americans could be forced to pay for the damage. Even worse, a climate fund designed to compensate for climate damages will only incentivize countries not to better adapt themselves to extreme weather events.

Climates change; it’s what they do. The best thing humanity can do to continue coping with climate change is to make sure everyone the world over is as wealthy as possible so that they can best adapt. Paying reparations to countries that do nothing to adapt is a step in the wrong direction.

Developed countries at the UN COP 27 summit agreed to create a ""loss and damage"" climate change fund.

The fund would compensate less developed countries bearing the brunt of climate change.

The agreement comes after 30 years of pushback from countries like the US.

World leaders from developed nations, including the United States, agreed Sunday to set up a fund for poorer nations at the United Nations COP 27 climate summit in Egypt, reversing on 30 years of hesitation to set up such a fund, the New York Times reported.

According to the Times, the final agreement for a ""loss and damage fund"" would require 24 countries to work together to arrange the details of who will contribute to the fund, who will receive funds, and where the money would go — the US is looking to exclude China as one of the developing countries that could benefit from the fund.

It also adds a stipulation that developing countries cannot sue developed countries for these payments.

COP 27, or the Conference of the Parties, is an annual summit put on by the UN to address the adverse impacts of climate change. Following the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992, the COP began meeting every year since in 1994, making this summit the 27 th.

Since the 1992 convention, developing countries have demanded that a ""loss and damage fund,"" facilitated by the UN, be implemented.

The decision will pave the way for developing countries, who are often the least responsible for the effects of climate change, to be compensated for losses and damages that they have endured as a result of the richest countries emitting the most greenhouse gases.

Dozens of developing nations, including small island nation like Vanuatu and much of Africa, pressed the rest of the world during the two-week summit in order to make headway on the fund. These countries were successful in getting it on the official agenda for the first time at an annual COP summit, the Times reported, signaling the urgency of the agreement.

Story continues

Pakistan, a country that experienced record-setting deadly flooding at the end of summer this year, was one of the countries that pushed for the fund.

Before this year's summit, Scotland was the only developed nation that offered to begin putting money towards the ""loss and damage"" of other nations. Other countries, including the US, have side-stepped the agreement in order to avoid legal repercussions — a fear that experts have said is misplaced.

However, developing nations in Europe changed course during this year's climate talks, pledging millions of dollars to assist developing nations combat damages and loss as a result of climate-induced natural disasters, the Times reported. After some pushback, the US soon agreed to the fund.

""The announcement offers hope to vulnerable communities all over the world who are fighting for their survival from climate stress,"" Sherry Rehman, Pakistan's minister for climate change, told the Times.

5f4e632c-2ab0-4958-a231-d203d59ed477,"The Biden administration has agreed to pay “climate reparations” because Democrats love nothing more than a good, old-fashioned climate scam.

President Joe Biden and his administration have, in principle, reached an agreement to pay money to poor countries as a form of “climate justice.” The logic goes that the U.S. and other wealthy countries are most responsible for carbon pollution, and so we have to pay money to poorer countries to offset the costs. This is because we are supposed to now pretend that any time a hurricane or a mudslide or some other extreme weather event happens, it is because of the mystical magic of “climate change,” regardless of evidence to the contrary.

TEXAS GROUP SUES BIDEN ADMINISTRATION OVER CLIMATE AGENDA

So, will China, the “world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases,” be paying climate reparations? Of course not. According to the New York Times, “the United States and the European Union are pushing for assurances that China will eventually contribute to any fund created.” So Biden has agreed to spend taxpayer dollars on “climate justice” for other countries even before acquiring a pinky promise from China that it would do the same.

It’s worse than that, though. Given that this scam runs through the United Nations, China is actually eligible to receive these funds. According to the New York Times, “the United Nations currently classifies China as a developing country, which would make it eligible for climate compensation.” But Biden committed to this even before seeking “assurances” that China would not be receiving any funds, let alone that it would be contributing.

A 2021 estimate by the United Nations would put the annual price tag for such a fund in the hundreds of billions of dollars. And you can bet, as is often the case with the United Nations, that the U.S. will be footing most of the bill while China gets all of the benefits.

Of course, no one in the Biden administration truly believes that climate change is as destructive as they claim. Otherwise, John Kerry and his private jet wouldn’t be in charge of climate policy. The same is true for the United Nations, who welcomed elites and their private jets to yet another climate conference to brainstorm this scam where normal taxpayers in the U.S. and European countries need to pay China for “climate justice.”

Fortunately, these funds would need to be appropriated by Congress, and House Republicans won’t go along with this farce. But it serves as yet another reminder of how Biden views taxpayer money and the issue of “climate change.” Biden and the Democratic Party are unserious environmental zealots, and their negotiations somehow favor China and the bloated bureaucracy of the United Nations more often than U.S. taxpayers."
12bc31e5-48b8-474c-ac1f-37fa65145b06,"© PR HANDOUT IMAGE PHOTO Australia can expect longer bushfire seasons, the new State of the Climate report warns.

As a new climate report paints a damning picture of the state of the Australian environment, the federal government says preparations must go beyond emissions reductions.

The country's climate has warmed on average 1.47C since national records began in 1910, according to the State of the Climate report released on Wednesday.

""That's why we have set aside a billion dollars for a disaster-ready fund,"" Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek told the ABC.

""It reminds us too that we need to prepare for the worst - you already have governments talking about changing land use in the future, how to better prepare our emergency services, how to better prepare our health system for these extreme events.""

The report found Australia is facing longer fire seasons, more intense tropical cyclones and oceans riddled with acidity due to rising global temperatures.

The eight years from 2013 to 2020 were the warmest on record, with 2019 taking top spot for the hottest recorded year.

""Concentrations of greenhouse gases are at the highest levels seen on Earth in at least two million years,"" director of the CSIRO's Climate Science Centre Jaci Brown said.

Since the 1950s, extreme fire weather has increased and fire seasons are starting sooner and ending later.

More rain like in recent La Niña seasons can heighten fire risks because thick vegetation dries out and creates fuel loads.

During question time on Wednesday, Climate Change Minister Chris Bowen said the government was committed to action, with an emissions reduction target legislated at 43 per cent by 2030 and the Senate ready to pass the government's electric vehicle tax cut.

""These are all important steps that are necessary and vital for Australia to act,"" he said.

However the Greens have remained critical of Labor's climate change policy, arguing the report reinforced the need for no more coal and gas plants.

""The government notes the State of the Climate report but then hides behind targets that are too low to fix it while also opening up new coal and gas mines,"" party leader Adam Bandt said.

The report from the Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO found Australia in the coming decades will experience increasing air temperatures and decreasing cool-season rain, with short but heavy rains expected.

Sea levels will continue to rise and warmer ocean temperatures will mean coral bleaching becomes more likely.

Australians will experience fewer tropical cyclones but the ones they do will be more intense.

As those in flood-affected areas could attest to, the intensity of short rainfall events has increased 10 per cent per storm.

The report comes following widespread flooding in parts of NSW and Victoria.

Government Services Minister Bill Shorten said the cost could run into the billions of dollars."

Read Transcribed Audio

The COP27 climate conference led to a major breakthrough, with the approval to create a fund to help poor countries most affected by climate change, but activist Catherine Abreu said more work is needed to phase out fossil fuels.

The deal on a loss and damage fund was reached at the end of the global climate conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, which started earlier this month. This fund is for countries battered by climate damage, such as the flooding in Pakistan and drought along the Horn of Africa.

Abreu is the founder of the climate advocacy group Destination Zero, a Canada-based NGO that's pushing to accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels.

She spoke with Matt Galloway on The Current. Here is part of that conversation.

You said in some ways that this has been a tale of two COPs. What did you mean by that?

So the top issues being discussed at COP27 were loss and damage and the phase-out of fossil fuels. And these are both issues that this process has failed to address for over 30 years. And so it was really significant to see them coming to a head here in Sharm el-Sheikh.

However, we unfortunately got a great outcome on one of those issues and a not-great outcome on the other. We did establish a loss and damage fund, but calls by multiple parties to include language in the final outcomes of COP27 that would suggest all parties have to phase out fossil fuels — so that's coal, oil, and gas — didn't make it into the final text.

People have been pushing for this for years and we have seen the urgent need for it when it comes to the effects of the climate crisis right now. From your perspective, how significant is this?

This is a landmark achievement for this process, particularly in a year like this which, as you say, has witnessed so many devastating climate impacts on communities around the world. I mean, you mentioned a few examples from outside of Canada, but we here in Canada have experienced loss and damage as well.

When I took a look at the coastline of Prince Edward Island after Hurricane Fiona, I thought: that's loss and damage right there. We're never getting that coastline back.

And so having a fund that helps the world's most vulnerable and poorest nations to address those devastating impacts is so critical to climate justice.

What do you think Canada's role will be in this fund?

I think it's important to note that on both of these key issues that I mentioned, Canada actually showed up at COP27 much more constructively than it ever has before. And that's particularly true on the issue of loss and damage.

Canada ... provided $7 million in funding to a project called Global Shield, which is linked to issues of loss and damage.

So what Canada needs to do is to keep being that constructive player and to think about how to bring real money to the table. $7 million isn't a whole lot to deal with these kinds of crises, so we're going to have to figure out how to increase that funding.

On the other side of things, when you look at the final text, you said the weasel words were in full force. What was wrong? What was missing in the final text?

With loss and damage ... we see that this COP had something meaningful to say about dealing with the consequences of climate change. However, it still missed the boat on having something meaningful to say about the cause of climate change, which is fossil fuels.

About 80 countries in total were asking the presidency of this COP to include a phase-out of all fossil fuels in the text. Just a handful of parties, really less than 10, were able to stall that progress.

Instead, we got text in the final decisions that calls for a phase-down of unabated coal and a phase-out of inefficient subsidies, and makes lots of references to things like low-emissions technologies.

And all of these, we know, are secret loopholes or backdoors that can really open the door to keeping up the production and consumption of fossil fuels, which we know we have to dramatically decrease and transition to renewable energy if we're going to address the climate crisis.

Canada's federal environment minister, Stephen Guilbeault, said last week that this country would not agree to adding that language, calling for a phase-out of all fossil fuels. What do you make of that?

That has been Canada's position for as long as we can remember, resisting any calls to really double down on the cause of climate change and to use the U.N. climate talks as an opportunity to think through how we move away from coal, oil and gas and toward renewable energy.

But it was really interesting, I think, to see Canada kind of change its position at the last minute at COP27. So while we heard earlier in this week that Canada would not support that statement, in the end they did actually voiced their support.

And I think that that's a sign of Canada coming around along with its major allies, including the U.S. and the U.K. and Australia. They also said: let's include a phase-out of all unabated fossil fuels.

So they included some of that weasel language, but they were willing to let the oil and gas element of it come into the text.

The message that is directed to those who are feeling this crisis right now — what do you think they should be thinking coming out of this conference? Will they feel as though the discussions met that urgency that they're feeling right on the ground?

I'll be honest that as much as we might have some critiques about the failings of this COP to really step up to the plate and have the guts to finally talk about phasing out all fossil fuels ... the fact that we made this leap on the issue of loss and damage does really give me hope.

I wouldn't have believed that we would be here, let alone a year ago. Not even two weeks ago would I have believed it.

And we were able to push to land this outcome on loss and damage. And we got so close to landing an outcome on fossil fuels as well.

I actually am walking away from this conference feeling a little more hopeful that it will be a constructive space for countries to really grapple with the depths of the climate crisis from now on.

That being said, the reality is what matters is what we do when we go home. And so for Canadians listening in on this, my message is the same as it often is, which is tell your elected official that you were expecting them to take action on climate change regardless of their political affiliation.

In the summer of 2022, scientists predicted that a ""third-year"" La Niña is very likely to occur during the winter of 2022.

Now, a team of researchers set out to study what the Eurasian climate will be like in the upcoming 2022 winter. Their findings were published in Advances in Atmospheric Sciences on Nov. 19.

La Niña is a climate pattern in the Pacific Ocean that can impact weather worldwide. During La Niña winters, the northern hemisphere often experiences frequent cold air outbreaks and heavy snowfalls.

To better understand the current La Niña, the team studied a variety of climate models. ""Almost all the climate models we examined predict an overall warm condition over most of Eurasia. It somewhat contradicts the knowledge that La Niña facilitates cold Eurasian winters, especially when the Arctic sea ice is still at its low level compared with the historical average,"" said Wang Lin from the Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).

The team suggested that these results may arise partly from global warming or the models' biases. ""Nevertheless, some post-processes to the model outputs indicate a possibility of below-normal temperature over mid-latitude Eurasia. Hence, there is still a chance of severe winter or some cold spells over Eurasia in the upcoming winter,"" said Wang.

""How the 2022–2023 winter weather and climate over the Eurasian continent respond to such a significant global climate signal and whether the Eurasian continent will experience a cold winter or not is an urgent question for seasonal climate prediction,"" said Zheng Fei from IAP.

The team used an ensemble approach, based on four different state-of-the-art coupled general circulation models developed by IAP to study the weather in the coming winter. They conducted seasonal predictions for surface air temperature and precipitation anomalies using this ensemble approach. To increase the accuracy, they calculated the prediction anomalies relative to the average of hindcasts for the years from 2002 to 2021.

How the future Eurasian climate will evolve in winter is still subject to some uncertainties, mostly according to the unpredictable internal atmospheric variability. ""Persistently improving the seasonal forecast skills of climate models and further understanding the influencing factors and physical processes on controlling the winter Eurasian surface air temperature, especially under a global warming background, should be our ultimate goal,"" said Zheng.

Looking ahead to future research, the team sees opportunities for improved predictions. Winter climate in Eurasian continent is closely associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation, but the predictive skill for the North Atlantic Oscillation needs to be improved. ""We need to solve this problem by improving our models in North Atlantic Oscillation simulations and developing a more advanced coupled assimilation scheme,"" said Wu Bo from IAP.

The team wants to continue to improve the capabilities of short-term climate prediction. ""In particular, in the context of global warming, the multi-system synergistic effect on climate has become increasingly significant. How to transform the synergistic effect into an effective predictor in the model is an important scientific problem to be solved, and also a great challenge,"" said Yao Yao from IAP.

Just when you got used to blaming La Niña for all of your problems, experts are now predicting that the weather will soon begin to invoke her dry sarcastic brother, El Niño.

According to a new prediction from Weatherzone, we will likely remain in La Niña weather for the next three months before pivoting to El Niño in April.

“The graph shows that La Niña has a 90 percent likelihood of remaining in place over the next three months,” Weatherzone said.

“Further into the future, this outlook suggests that El Niño becomes the most likely state for the Pacific Ocean late in the Southern Hemisphere’s winter in 2023.”

However, it’s worth noting that the predictions are based on US forecasting, which is different to how BOM, uhh, I mean The Bureau do things over here in Australia.

The news comes after BOM predicted that La Niña would end in early 2023, which is pretty close to the Weatherzone prediction.

For those unfamiliar with weather patterns, an El Niño event happens when sea surface temperatures are warmer than normal.

“An El Niño occurs when sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean become substantially warmer than average, and this causes a shift in atmospheric circulation. Typically, the equatorial trade winds blow from east to west across the Pacific Ocean. El Niño events are associated with a weakening, or even reversal, of the prevailing trade winds,” the BoM website reads.

Warming of ocean temperatures in the central and eastern Pacific causes this area to become more conducive to tropical rainfall and cloud development. As a result, the heavy rainfall that usually occurs to the north of Australia moves to the central and eastern parts of the Pacific basin.

Unfortunately, this means that on top of the current threat of flooding, experts are warning people to start stressing about the potential of a drought."
72a379c1-efa7-4179-8f39-a087bba97b1e,"As the COP27 climate summit drew to a close over the weekend, it’s important to acknowledge that progress was made on climate adaptation – even if more can be done.

“Climate adaptation” is a term for how countries adapt to the impacts of climate change. It could be, for instance, by strengthening infrastructure to better withstand disasters, moving towns out of floodplains, or transforming the agriculture sector to minimise food insecurity.

As the costs of disasters climb, working out who will finance climate adaptation has become increasingly urgent for developing nations. For decades, they’ve called upon wealthy countries – largely responsible for causing the climate crisis in the first place – to foot the bill.

So let’s explore what COP27 achieved, how these achievements might translate into tangible commitments, and what must happen now to give everyone a fighting chance to survive on a hotter planet.

A thorny issue

The thorniest issues at climate change negotiations are about finance: who is giving, who is receiving, how is the money received and what kind of finance is made available.

Developed countries don’t have a good track record on this. In 2009, they committed to mobilising US$100 billion per year of climate finance by 2020 – a target that remains unmet.

Read more: COP27: one big breakthrough but ultimately an inadequate response to the climate crisis

What’s more, most climate finance so far has been directed towards helping developing nations mitigate their emissions, rather than for adaptation.

As Dina Saleh, the Regional Director of the United Nations International Fund for Agricultural Development, explained during the conference, failing to help rural populations adapt could lead to more poverty, migrations and conflict. She said:

We are calling on world leaders from developed nations to honour their pledge to provide the $100 billion a year in climate finance to developing nations and to channel half of that [for] climate adaptation.

Adaptation finance still falls short

The United Nations has established different funds to channel adaptation finance, including the Least Developed Countries Fund, Special Climate Change Fund and Adaptation Fund.

At COP27, eight countries pledged US$105.6 million for adaptation via the Least Developed Countries Fund and Special Climate Change Fund, including Sweden, Germany and Ireland. Others, such as the United States and Canada, expressed potential future financial commitments.

These funds are in addition to the US$413 million promised at COP26 in Glasgow last year, via the Least Developed Countries Fund. The money will target the most urgently needed adaptation efforts, such as strengthening infrastructure, social safety nets and diversifying livelihoods.

There is also a specific new funding for small-island developing states. While this development has been welcomed by the Alliance of Small Island States, it also says faster processes are needed to make the money available.

Small island nations such as Tuvalu are already experiencing severe climate impacts, and the projections are dire. For example, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found some atoll islands are likely to experience coral bleaching every year by 2040.

These islands are also particularly vulnerable to tropical cyclones. One single large event can set development back years. For example, in 2016 tropical cyclone Winston took out over a third of Fiji’s GDP in about 36 hours.

Similarly, other highly vulnerable nations across Africa and Asia are asking for easier access to adaptation finance. The Adaptation Fund included an innovation that gave countries easier access to money, and ensured it responds directly to each country’s needs.

At COP27, this fund received over US$230 million in new pledges. However, it currently has unfunded adaptation projects worth US$380 million in the pipeline, signalling the urgent need to ramp up finance.

Progress is edging forward

The Paris Agreement in 2015 set the “global goal on adaptation” to drive collective progress on climate adaptation worldwide. At COP27, countries agreed to develop a framework for this goal in 2023. This includes gender-responsive approaches, and science-based metrics and targets to track progress.

Another big-ticket item is the “global stocktake” on adaptation, which measures progress at the national level on fulfilling Paris Agreement obligations.

At COP27, it was noted only 40 countries so far have submitted their national adaptation plans, which identify adaptation priorities and strategies for reducing climate vulnerability. Questions remain about how to accelerate the planning, implementation and financing of these plans.

The Sharm-el-Seikh Adaptation Agenda was also launched by the two UN-appointed High-Level Climate Champions. These seek to engage non-state actors, such as cities, businesses and investors, to boost ambition for climate adaptation.

The agenda’s ultimate aim is to help 4 billion people become more resilient to climate change impacts by 2030. It has 30 adaptation outcomes to aim for, including:

protecting 3 billion people from disasters by installing smart and early warning systems in the most vulnerable communities

investing US$4 billion to secure the future of 15 million hectares of mangroves worldwide

mobilising US$140-300 billion across both public and private finance sources for adaptation.

What now?

Many pledges on adaptation finance have been made in COP26 and COP27, and the next step is to get the money where it is most urgently needed.

As climate impacts are already unfolding rapidly, communities worldwide must develop the capacity to plan for climate adaptation. This requires action at every level, and shouldn’t be left to local communities alone.

Making progress on climate adaptation in the coming years is crucial. Early action and planning can save thousands of dollars, but only if we have robust processes in place to make decisions before impacts occur. This calls for more planning, investments and collaboration across local, regional, state and international levels.

But most important is the willingness to change our mindset. We must stop operating in a business-as-usual model and push for a more sustainable world in this changing climate.

436c881b-8cbe-4d39-bc32-fe0cfa0c25f9,"Sky News host Chris Kenny says the COP27, which wrapped up last week, “may well be remembered as the greatest heist in Egypt since Tutankhamun’s Tomb was robbed”.

“Because the agreement to advance the so-called ‘loss and damage’ fund, or reparations from developed countries to developing nations, could see the additional transfer of $2 trillion … every year,” he said.

“And this comes on top of the trillions of dollars that developed countries already spend on foreign aid in developing countries, which is something I strongly support.

“But as our climate minister Chris Bowen celebrates and flies home, we’re left to wonder why on earth Australia would support this item on the COP agenda.”

Mr Kenny said this will amount to “more money being spent on climate gestures beyond our control” and “more economic pain for us”.

“And very likely the diversion of some of our foreign aid that otherwise would be spent on crucial education, health and governance programs.”"

The US took this year’s unwanted title for so far failing to back the creation of a new “loss and damage” fund, tentatively backed by the European Union, that would provide money to poorer countries suffering severe climate impacts.

John Kerry, the US climate envoy, has said the US is open to discussing the idea over the next two years, although it is wary of opening itself up to any sort of liability for the damages its huge historical emissions have caused.

“Sadly, the US traded its supposed climate ambition for some dino-sized hypocrisy at this summit,” said Jean Su, energy justice director at the Center for Biological Diversity. Su said that the US has not only blocked loss and damage financing but is pushing ahead with new gas infrastructure on the Gulf of Mexico coast.

“In these closing hours of Cop27 the US can still show its climate chops, commit to a loss and damage fund and push for a fossil fuel phaseout in the final text,” she added.

“Dishonourable mentions” in the awards went to Russia for bringing a large contingent of fossil fuel lobbyists and to the “climate disaster” caused by Brazil under the outgoing government of Jair Bolsonaro. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Bolsonaro’s successor as Brazilian president, has, however, received a largely warm welcome from activists at Cop27 due to his promises to stamp out deforestation in the Amazon."

COP27, the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, broke up at dawn on 20 November. The final communiqué came just hours before the football World Cup kicked off in Qatar, continuing a time-honoured tradition of these summits going into extra time before any sort of result is achieved.

In many other respects, the meeting had a depressingly familiar feel to it, too. Delegates reaffirmed their commitment to the goal of the 2015 Paris climate agreement — to limit global warming to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial temperatures — while making no further commitments to phase out fossil fuels. This is a shocking dereliction of duty. For warming to be limited to 1.5 °C, emissions need to fall by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030. According to the latest UNFCCC report, published in October, they are set to increase by more than 10%. There is still no coordinated plan to turn these figures around. With some 45,000 people registered to attend COP27 — a record — many are questioning whether a planetary emergency can be tackled in this way.

One undoubted step forwards, however, came with the historic agreement to create a ‘loss and damage’ fund. For the first time, countries that have suffered devastation as a result of climate change will be helped with the associated costs, such as those of rebuilding homes and businesses destroyed by floods. This represents a totally new kind of fund, going beyond existing (if imperfectly implemented) mechanisms for funding the costs of mitigating and adapting to the effects of climate change.

COP27 climate summit: what scientists are watching

It’s taken three decades to get to this point, at least in part because of arguments between richer and poorer countries on a whole raft of issues. These range from a lack of agreed definitions on what constitutes climate finance to a fear on the part of richer countries that they could end up liable for trillions of dollars in loss-and-damage payments.

Arguments over money resurface at every COP. Doubtless they will return at COP28, which is due to be held in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates in a year’s time. The size of the loss-and-damage fund, who will contribute and which countries will benefit are all yet to be discussed.

To help settle at least some points of disagreement, a group of climate-vulnerable countries will be asking the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to assemble an expert synthesis of the relevant scientific literature on loss and damage, and to publish its findings in a special report. This will help negotiators to tackle questions such as what is meant by loss and damage from climate change, and to what extent individual events can be attributed to climate change.

This is an excellent idea, not least because it will help to establish areas in which experts largely agree — or disagree — and so identify instances in which further research could help to unpick outstanding questions. But it doesn’t go far enough. The IPCC should also prepare an evidence synthesis on climate finance itself. The lack of such a synthesis means that even the most basic concepts and methodologies are disputed, says Romain Weikmans, a researcher at the Université Libre de Bruxelles, who is one of those pushing the IPCC to take on this task. It’s not just loss and damage: the ins and outs of mitigation and adaptation finance are also still hotly disputed.

Donor countries, for example, count money that has been pledged or promised, say for investment in flood defences or wind energy. But low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) would prefer to count only money that has actually been received by projects on the ground, often a much smaller amount. Donors also count loans — which account for the lion’s share of climate finance — whereas LMICs would prefer to count only grants or other money that does not have to be repaid. Then there’s the question of scope. If a new housing development in an area of high temperatures is fitted with special cool roofs, say, some would like to count the whole development as climate finance, whereas others would say just the roof part qualifies.

Carbon emissions hit new high: warning from COP27

Questions surrounding climate finance are not going to go away. Many are clearly political, and need to be decided at a COP by government negotiators. Those negotiators would benefit enormously if the research community could set out options to inform their positions, and provide a sense of the balance of agreement and disagreement around those options.

The IPCC has performed such a role before, Weikmans points out. In 1998, it established an expert task force on accounting for greenhouse-gas emissions, to bring consistency to an array of different national methodologies. Before that, in 1995, it assessed the literature on whether humans are causing climate change, agreeing the now famous phrase: “The balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate.” That settled a long-running argument among scientists and governments, and paved the way for the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the first legally binding agreement made with the aim of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.

The way the IPCC is set up means that if governments want its advice, they must make a formal request. That request is now overdue. Blutus Mbambi, co-founder of the Centre for Climate Change Action and Advocacy in Lusaka, Zambia, tells Nature that it was shocking to see how long negotiators in Sharm El-Sheikh spent in debates over the text, and how little evidence they had before them to make their decisions. Research must start getting match fit now, before the next round in Dubai."

It was an unequivocal confirmation that poor countries, with limited resources, are being most impacted by extreme weather events like floods, heat waves and storms and, at least at some level, industrialized nations that have done the most to contribute to climate change have a responsibility to help.

While government leaders, environmentalists and activists celebrated plans for such a fund, there are many outstanding questions, ranging from how it will work to long-term repercussions. Here is a look at the development of the idea of ""loss and damage,"" the term it was given in climate negotiations, and what we know about the fund.

History

In the early 1990s, the Alliance of Small Island States, a group of low-lying coastal and small island countries, began calling for the establishment of a loss and damage fund as the United Nations was creating a framework to deal with climate change on an international level.

Since then, the idea has always been a part of annual U.N. climate summits. However, it was often talked about on the margins of negotiations, something developing nations and activists would push for while many rich nations used their weight to squash the idea. For the first time, at this year's COP27 it was included in the agenda and became the centerpiece of discussions.

Who will fund it?

The fund will initially draw on contributions from developed countries and other private and public sources, such as international financial institutions, with an option for other major economies to join down the line.

The final text points to ""identifying and expanding sources of funding,"" something the EU, the U.S. and others had pushed for during negotiations, suggesting that nations that are both high-polluting and considered developing under the criteria, should also pay into the fund.

During the talks, China said money for the new fund should come from developed countries, not them. But there's precedence for China to voluntarily pay into climate funds, if the U.S. does too.

When the Obama administration pledged $3 billion to the Green Climate Fund in 2014, China also paid $3.1 billion for the fund.

More details of who pays will be decided by a committee that plans to get the fund going within a year.

Who will get money?

The deal says the fund will assist ""developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change,"" though there will be room for middle-income countries that are severely affected by climate disasters to also get paid.

Pakistan, which was devastated by flooding that put a third of the country underwater, or Cuba, recently battered by Hurricane Ian, could be eligible.

How the loss and damage fund will fit in with ""other institutions, agencies that are out there doing humanitarian work, helping people rebuild, dealing with migration and refugee crises, dealing with food security, water security"" will need to be worked out, said David Waskow, the World Resources Institute international climate director.

Those details will also be hammered out by the committee in the coming year.

Rebuilding trust

Beyond just financial help, setting up the fund is seen as a huge step forward, but how it's ultimately viewed will depend in part on how fast it can be set up.

In the closing session Sunday, Antigua's Lia Nicholson said the transitional committee should be set up immediately and given clear mandates.

""This loss and damage fund must become the lifeboat that we need it to be,"" she said.

There is a credibility gap because of past broken promises.

In 2009, rich nations agreed to provide $100 billion a year to help developing countries transition to green energy systems and adapt to climate change. However, to date, that initiative has never been fully funded.

Repercussions

One of the main reasons that rich nations long opposed such a loss and damage fund was the fear that it would open them up to long-term liability. Despite the passage, that concern is very much still at play, as evidence by how negotiators made sure the language of the fund didn't say ""liability"" and that contributions were voluntary.

Despite those caveats, the establishment of such a fund could have repercussions, both legal and symbolic, in climate circles and beyond. For example, several Pacific Island nations have been pushing for the International Court of Justice to consider climate change. They argue that international laws must be strengthened to protect their rights in the case that their lands are engulfed by rising seas. The establishment of a loss and damage fund could bolster those arguments."

They argue that international laws must be strengthened to protect their rights in the case that their lands are engulfed by rising seas. The establishment of a loss and damage fund could bolster those arguments.

7c5c2650-4f52-4715-924d-fb021d5b9783,"A global transition to a low-carbon economy will require investments of at least US$4 trillion a year (£3.4 trillion) according to the implementation plan agreed at COP27 UN climate change summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. Delivering this funding will involve nothing less than “a swift and comprehensive transformation of the financial system”, a UN bulletin reads.

At the start of the conference, the prime minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley, proposed a way to kickstart this process by reforming two of the largest financial institutions: the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Her plan, known as the Bridgetown initiative, would mobilise more than US$1 trillion from the World Bank among other development lenders and US$500 million from the IMF.

Mottley’s proposed strategy is three-pronged. First, increase the volume of finance available to low and middle-income countries to address climate change. Second, hasten the disbursement of this money and make lenders offer more long-term financing, which is critical in maintaining investment. Third, allow countries recovering from disasters to pause their debt payments.

Mottley’s initiative follows claims that the World Bank and other major lenders are institutionally risk-averse, paralysing efforts to raise money to build the solar and wind farms which can replace fossil fuels and the defences which can help countries adapt to extreme weather and sea-level rise. This concurs with some findings in my own research.

Why are these two Washington-based institutions so important for tackling climate change – and how might their strategies need to change?

The right climate for investment

The World Bank and IMF have served two different purposes since their origin in 1944. Both provide funding to low and middle-income countries, but the World Bank mostly funds infrastructure projects, such as wind farms. The IMF typically offers budget support in case of emergencies such as a shortage of foreign currency or an inability to fund government spending.

The World Bank disbursed more than US$60 billion in 2022. This amount can be increased in two ways.

First, high-income countries could bring fresh funds to the World Bank. The organisation would in turn use this to offer grants and loans to low and middle-income countries with a zero interest rate (or close to). But this process is open to political influence which might prioritise objectives other than mitigating climate change, like expanding primary education.

Second, the World Bank could act without receiving additional capital from governments. Instead, it would borrow from financial markets and use these funds to lend to low and middle-income countries. In the short term, this would meet the demands from delegates and activists at COP27 that the World Bank give more loans and take more risk. But this is not a long-term solution. Issuing debt may increase the World Bank’s cost of financing, which would eventually be passed on to those borrowers.

This option may ultimately backfire. The Bridgetown initiative proposes more more flexible lending standards which may erode the capital of the World Bank. This is not an abstract hypothesis – the African Development Bank came close to shutting down in 1995 as a result of similar practices.

Overall, I am excited for the new role that the World Bank and IMF could play in coming years. But these two organisations will not meet popular demands to finance climate projects without a large and sustained funding programme by high income countries.

Caribbean countries weather climate extremes and hope richer states deliver on promised funding

Caribbean countries weather climate extremes and hope richer states deliver on promised funding

(Johan Ordonez/AFP/Getty Images)

The climax of the COP27 climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, this past weekend was the establishment of a loss and damage fund for countries most affected by climate disaster.

But the pledge was short on many key details, including how much money would be raised and which countries would actually contribute.

The conference came at a time when countries in the Caribbean are again seeing some of the worst effects of climate change. Just this month, Hurricane Lisa tore through Belize, flooding its districts with a storm surge measuring 1.2 metres and higher.

Hurricanes were a staple of my childhood in Jamaica. While I now live in Canada, tropical cyclones remain a visceral reality for my family and everyone else in the Caribbean. My brother, who lives in Belize, experienced the impact of Lisa first-hand.

""I've lived through a lot of hurricanes, and that to us did not feel like a Category 1,"" my brother, Wayne Piper, told me. ""It might have been where we were in proximity to the eye … but [Lisa], I think in all my life of riding out hurricanes, that one was scary.""

The hurricane tore off parts of Wayne's roof, flooded the ground floor of his home, knocked down trees and power lines and generally wreaked havoc on the country. After 24 hours, Lisa was downgraded to a tropical depression and moved onto Guatemala and upwards to Mexico, before raining itself out.

Like Belize, Jamaica has seen extreme weather for years. Wayne and I have vivid memories of growing up there: dry, yellowed crops during an extended drought; the cacophony of whistling winds and pounding rain during a major hurricane; the rich, earthy smell of the soil after a downpour; eroded infrastructure after a merciless flood; and the scorching heat against your skin on an abnormally hot summer day.

These effects are felt everywhere in the Caribbean. According to the International Monetary Fund, the damage from these disasters — when measured as a ratio to GDP — was six times higher for Caribbean countries than for larger ones. This damage makes it painfully difficult for people to contend with the unpredictability of climate.

While Jamaica hasn't been directly hit by a hurricane in the last 20 years, ""that does not mean it has not been impacted by hurricanes that have gone nearby,"" said climate scientist Michael Taylor, who is based in the capital, Kingston. ""And every time a hurricane passes by, it causes significant costs for infrastructure.""

Taylor, who is also a professor at the University of the West Indies in Jamaica, said that climate disasters affect every aspect of society: schools, roads, power, agriculture, food, water supply and, ultimately, the economy.

He calls it ""the recurrent cost of always having to recover,"" which ultimately sets Caribbean countries back years.

Caribbean leaders have called for oil and gas companies to share their profits and asked for additional financial assistance to help adapt to the climate crisis and rebuild after disasters.

""We won't be able to meet the capital expenditure that will allow us to sufficiently change out our national fleet to [electric vehicles], allow us to sufficiently change out our energy production at the rate we need to, to meet our mitigation targets without outside assistance,"" said Matthew Samuda, Jamaica's minister without portfolio for economic growth and job creation, in an interview before COP27.

""The assistance we're interested in is larger grants. We actually need genuine investment in our survival.""

The loss and damage fund negotiated at COP27 comes on the heels of a broken promise — that is, a financial pledge from rich countries to pay into a $100-billion US fund on an annual basis from 2020 to 2025 to help poorer countries mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change.

That initiative was conceived 13 years ago at the climate summit in Copenhagen. Canada was asked to help establish the delivery plan, detailing when and how those funds would be raised. However, developed countries won't reach $100 billion until 2023.

Similar to post-tropical storm Fiona's rampage in Atlantic Canada in October, cyclones in the Caribbean are getting wilder, deadlier and costlier. According to the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center, climate change is likely making these cyclones stronger, which means heavier rainfall and more flooding.

My brother and his family count themselves lucky to have survived Lisa and privileged to be able to recuperate safely and quickly. While the world waits for more details about the loss and damage fund, people in the Caribbean are coping in the only way they know how: by turning every loss into an opportunity and looking for solutions on a local and human level.

""One thing that we have found going through our stuff while we try to clean out the house,"" my brother said, is ""we have so many more things than we need, and you can donate them. There are people who may have use for those things, because people have lost everything.""

Reader feedback

Ivan Lantz:

""I agree with the [fossil fuel] non-proliferation initiative . The strong point is the demand for alternatives to fossil fuels. Governments are not sufficiently engaged in creating supply of alternative fuels and energy. As long as there are no alternatives, the demand for petroleum-based carbon fuels will remain strong. It is the simple laws of supply and demand: supply the alternatives to meet the demand.""

The Big Picture: Greenwashing the 2022 World Cup

From the day it was announced back in 2010, the staging of the 2022 World Cup in the Gulf state of Qatar has been the subject of harsh criticism and defensive hand-wringing. The headline issues have been the country's criminalization of homosexuality and the deaths of thousands of migrant workers involved in building the stadiums necessary to host the planet's biggest sporting event. As it turns out, people are also questioning organizers' claims of sustainability .

Prior to the first game, soccer's scandal-plagued governing body, FIFA, announced that the 2022 World Cup would be ""fully carbon-neutral"" — a claim environmentalists noted you can only accurately make after the event. The group Carbon Market Watch has cast doubt on the tournament's green bona fides by citing the embedded carbon cost of building seven new stadiums to accommodate the World Cup, some of which are likely to be dismantled or left stranded afterwards, given that the country does not have a fanatical soccer culture like countries in Europe, South America or Africa.

Given the number of foreign footie fans expected to make the trek, Qatar is also expecting 1,300 daily flights in and out of the country. Hard up for visitor accommodations in the capital, Doha, organizers suggested that some fans might want to stay in neighbouring United Arab Emirates and then take the one-hour flight to Doha on game day .

Then there's the grass itself. The seeds had to be flown in by plane from North America, and each pitch requires about 10,000 litres of water a day. And because Qatar has so little fresh water to draw from, the water has to be desalinated — another energy- and emissions-intensive process.

Hot and bothered: Provocative ideas from around the web

COP27 in Egypt ended with a promising (if detail-deficient) pledge to create a fund to help countries battered by climate disaster. But a deal to accelerate emissions reductions did not happen.

As rising sea levels threaten island countries, some are taking unusual and provocative steps to raise awareness and protect their heritage. Tuvalu is creating a ""digital twin"" of itself in the metaverse in order to test what climate change could ultimately do to the Pacific country.

The latest episode of the brilliant podcast Cautionary Tales tells the story of the late American scientist Thomas Midgley Jr. , a man responsible for two environmentally disastrous innovations: leaded gasoline and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), used in refrigeration.

How climate change has helped greener energy businesses take off in Canada

(Ben Nelms/CBC)

Many Canadian businesses have been hit hard in the last few years by everything from the pandemic to the war in Ukraine to climate change.

But for some, climate change has been a boon, in part because of government grants meant to increase energy efficiency as Canada aims for net-zero emissions by 2050 .

It's all part of a global shift to greener energy options. Solar energy now provides the most renewable energy jobs in the world — 4.3 million jobs by the end of 2021 — according to a report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), in collaboration with the United Nations' International Labour Organization (ILO).

An estimated 700,000 new renewable energy jobs were created worldwide in the past year, bringing the total jobs in this sector to nearly 13 million, according to the IRENA report.

A rush to find greener ways to beat the heat waves and cold snaps that result from extreme weather is driving unprecedented demand for solar and electric options, according to those who sell and install solar panels and heating and cooling systems, including heat pumps.

A heat pump is an electric device that uses many of the same components as a fridge or air conditioner — like a compressor, condenser, expansion valve or evaporator — and can be used to both heat and cool a home.

On Monday, Canada announced details of the Oil to Heat Pump Affordability (OHPA) Grant , designed to help low- to median-income households switch from oil to heat pumps. The grant will offer up to $5,000 to cover costs including the purchase and installation of heat pumps and the safe removal of oil tanks.

But even before that announcement, heat pump installers were busy.

Toronto-based Ricardo Ramberansingh runs Heatpumps.ca, Ductless.ca and the Boiler Shoppe. He says he sells hundreds of heat pumps in Ontario, as customers are ""ripping out gas furnaces"" over concerns about climate change, fuel costs and the environment.

Business, says Ramberansingh, has been spectacular. For competitive reasons, Ramberansingh won't say exactly how many heat pumps he's installed, but he says sales are up 300 per cent in the past few years.

Kaleb Rodgers of Rikur Energy Inc. in Burnaby, B.C., says solar sales really soared once the pandemic hit. The company went from installing about 30 systems per year to about 75. Each system costs between $15,000 and $30,000, but Rodgers says the Canada Greener Homes initiative , launched in May 2021, helps people offset the ""hefty price tag up front.""

The Greener Homes initiative from Natural Resources Canada offers grants of up to $5,000 and interest-free loans of up to $40,000 for energy-conscious home retrofits.

Rodgers says customers have told him they're not only doing good for the environment but also for the general population because they are ""pushing clean energy back into our hydro grid.""

B.C. Hydro allows customers to use any surplus energy their solar systems produce to offset future energy bills, so that is also an incentive.

To help Canada hit its zero emissions target by 2050, federal and provincial grants — including the Greener Homes and OHPA grants and rebates offered by B.C. Hydro — are in place to help people retrofit their homes.

According to the federal government, as of September, the Greener Homes program has received more than 196,000 grant applications, with more than 38,000 coming the first week the program was launched. The program has issued $69 million in grants to almost 19,000 homeowners

As of Nov. 14, the program had issued 3,202 grants for solar panels, 8,572 grants for heat pumps and 11,123 grants for window and door upgrades.

The program has helped kick-start changes, according to Chris Palliser, a spokesperson for Shift Energy Group in B.C.

Shift Energy started designing and building solar energy storage systems in Western Canada, but is now expanding to the East Coast.

Palliser says the cost of solar panels has decreased dramatically over the past decade. But he says the falling price of solar panels isn't the only reason business is booming.

""Climate change is playing a huge role,"" Palliser said. ""It's the heat domes, the atmospheric rivers that are happening in our face. I think people are taking note and thinking something has to be done.""

He said that high energy costs and changes in weather have coalesced for a variety of groups, including frugal investors, climate activists, energy-independence seekers and tech trend-setters.

Since 2020, Palliser says Shift Energy's rate of solar system installation has increased sixfold and that they have hired 35 new employees in the last six months.

""Demand is there,"" he said.

137a342a-9cbe-4600-94e5-39ff17a5f270,"Summary COP27 talks strike deal on helping poorer countries

Delegates seek broader reform of financial system

World Bank risk-taking in focus for many countries















SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov 21 (Reuters) - A deal struck at the COP27 climate talks in Egypt calls for an overhaul of the post-World War Two international financial architecture that has guided three generations of development aid but is struggling to fund the needs of a warmer planet.

As the impacts of climate change worsen, delegates at the U.N. summit that ended at the weekend pressed for reform to speed up the flow of funding to developing countries - to help them cut emissions and cope with the floods or wildfires they are already experiencing.

The final COP27 deal agreed to set up a ""loss and damage"" fund to help poorer countries pay for the impacts of climate disaster. It also referred to the need to reform international financial institutions.

Avinash Prasad, climate adviser to the prime minister of Barbados, said the agreement reached in the early hours of Sunday had injected momentum into ""a much bigger transformation of our global financial system"".

It should lead to a tripling of the amount international financial institutions lend ""with a clear focus on climate and sustainable development goals,"" Prasad said.

The push for reforms to help release more finance this year gathered pace when Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley helped to draw up suggested steps she then championed at COP27.

Mottley's suggestions include loans at lower interest rates from multilateral lenders such as the World Bank, changes to how ratings agencies assess risks to projects and increased use of International Monetary Fund reserve funds.

She also urged more windall taxes on oil and gas company profits and the pausing of debt repayments for countries hit by climate disasters.

As other leaders lent their backing, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry called for a mosaic of changes to the system to increase the impact of public finance.

Kerry also urged the development banks and their shareholders to come to the banks' meetings early next year armed with plans to free up hundreds of billions of dollars that could release trillions of dollars more of private capital.

Meanwhile, a report by a panel of experts for the G20 group of leading industrialised nations suggested five recommendations for making the development banks better equipped to cope with the demands being made.

BRIDGING A MASSIVE GAP

Many followers of the climate debate see reform of the development banks such as the World Bank Group, in which the U.S. holds the biggest stake, as crucial to closing the gap between the amounts promised and that delivered.

Developed countries have yet to meet a 2009 pledge to provide $100 billion per year in climate finance to developing countries and last year the rich contributed just $83 billion.

The discrepancy versus overall needs is bigger still. A report released during the U.N. talks estimated developing countries will need around $1 trillion a year by 2030 from development banks and private investors.

Last year, the biggest multilateral development banks gave $51 billion in climate finance to low- and middle-income countries, a report from the lenders showed, alongside $13 billion from private investors.

Faced with a torrent of criticism at COP27 from delegates wanting more, the World Bank said in order to increase financing, it needs wealthy donors to provide fresh funds.

Similarly, Akinwumi Adesina, head of the African Development Bank said: ""If you want to do more, you actually need more.""

""There has to be a lot more increase in capital, for the multilateral development banks,"" he told Reuters.

Reflecting a wide-spread view at the conference, Australia Climate and Energy minister Chris Bowen told delegates that multilateral development banks, including the World Bank, must adapt in the face of the climate challenge.

""Our international financial architecture is built for a different time and different challenges,"" he said.

""Some of our financial institutions are stepping up to this task, our most important global job, but others are not.""

When Mia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados, spoke at the opening ceremony of last year’s UN climate negotiations, or COP26, she made global headlines with her fiery criticism of rich nations. “The world stands at a fork in the road,” she told the audience, “one no less significant than when the United Nations was first created in 1945. Will we act in the interest of our people, who are depending on us, or will we allow the path of greed and selfishness to sow the seeds of our common destruction?”

This year, at COP27 in Egypt, Mottley followed up her viral speech with a proposal that she believes would help ensure social, economic, and environmental justice. She put forward the Bridgetown Agenda, which is named after Barbados’s capital and calls for an overhaul of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Citing a debt crisis exacerbated by the pandemic, rising living costs, and climate change, the Bridgetown Agenda would suspend IMF debt payments for the poorest countries, defer interest surcharges, and make $100 billion immediately available to those nations that need it. Additionally, the proposal demands a new global mechanism to cover the loss and damage caused by climate change, which was a successful outcome at COP27. This, according to Mottley, would lay the groundwork for “a new financial system that drives financial resources towards climate action.”

The Bridgetown Agenda states: “Most climate-vulnerable countries do not have the fiscal space to adopt new debt. We must move beyond country-by-country responses that have become bogged down by issues of who should do more.” It advocates a new multilateral institution for “raising reconstruction grants for any country just imperiled by a climate disaster.” It calls for $650 billion in emergency liquidity and for development banks to issue $1 trillion in low-interest loans for climate spending in poorer countries.

Mottley has also pushed back against some of the traditional IMF stipulations to qualify for loans, questioning the need to privatize national assets, fire civil servants, liberalize trade, and deregulate domestic economic activity. Confronting the climate crisis will require a lot of spending and investment, especially in frontline communities in the Global South. Wealthy countries typically get interest rates between 1 and 4 percent, while developing countries are forced to borrow at rates of between 12 and 14 percent. The Bridgetown Agenda asks that nations in the Global South be offered better financial terms, closer to what countries in the Global North already receive.

This new approach would effectively dismantle the financial framework that has been in place since 1944, when 44 nations met in Bretton Woods, N.H. The Bretton Woods conference established the IMF and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which today is part of the World Bank.

Addressing COP27 on November 11, former vice president Al Gore said, “We need to reconvene Bretton Woods and completely revamp and reform the World Bank system.” He said it could be accomplished within a year. Gore also called for David Malpass, the Donald Trump–appointed World Bank president, to be removed from his post. Current Issue View our current issue

In September, when Malpass appeared alongside the head of the IMF and Bahamian leaders on a New York Times climate panel, he was asked if he agreed that the “man-made burning of fossil fuels is rapidly and dangerously warming the planet.” He refused to answer the question three times before he finally replied, “I don’t even know—I’m not a scientist.”

In response, Joe Thwaites of the Natural Resources Defense Council wrote, “We know climate change is not a priority for Malpass, not just from his words but from his deeds.” Thwaites went on to outline how, since Malpass’s appointment in 2019, the World Bank “has been dragging its feet on taking the climate crisis seriously, at a time when we need it to sprint,” namely by “lagging behind its peers” in funding climate-focused projects, hampering other multi-development banks from doing so, and providing over $14 billion in funding for fossil fuels.

The UN climate negotiations are the world’s largest gathering of nations and NGOs (and, yes, a growing number of fossil fuel lobbyists). Crucially, these talks bring participating nations together on a level playing field. Critics point out that even though 27 annual UN climate negotiations have taken place, the climate crisis has only grown worse during that time. But Mottley’s actions offer hope. While the Bridgetown Agenda is a long way from implementation, it has widespread support among countries in both the Global South and the G7.

Mottley has used the unwieldy and unlikely vehicle of the UN climate conference to have this discussion about the global financial architecture. And her plan just might undo the Bretton Woods system, which was decided on by a minority of nations, less than 80 years ago, with disastrous results. Overhauling Bretton Woods would be one of the most radical economic and political shifts of the past century. And it can’t happen soon enough."

The press release below is distributed through Panoscope, a series of Panos Caribbean

Stakeholders from Caribbean small island developing states (SIDS) have welcomed the decision to establish a loss and damage response fund from the recently concluded United Nations Climate Conference (COP27) in Egypt.

“We have literally exhausted all of our efforts … to bring home the climate action commitments our vulnerable people desperately need,” said Antigua and Barbuda’s Environment Minister Molwyn Joseph, chair of the Alliance of Small Island Developing States (AOSIS), in a recent statement.

“Our ministers and negotiators have endured sleepless nights and endless days in an intense series of negotiations, determined to secure the establishment of a loss and damage response fund, keep 1.5° alive, and advance ambition on critical mitigation and adaptation plans,” he added.

AOSIS has represented the interests of some 39 SIDS and low-lying coastal developing states for more than two decades in climate negotiations and sustainable development processes.

Labelled a breakthrough decision, the agreement to establish a loss and damage fund forms a part of a package of decisions from the international negotiations. It follows years of deliberations on the call for financial support to help developing countries respond to post-climate-related impacts, including livelihoods loss; and the addition of loss and damage to the COP agenda for the first time.

However, even as stakeholders celebrate, they are mindful of the work ahead to operationalise the fund.

Executive Director (ED) of the Caribbean Community Climate Change Centre (CCCCC), Dr Colin Young, said while the hard-fought-for loss and damage decision was certainly welcomed, it is now time to ensure the fund becomes operational and benefits SIDS and other developing countries.

“The details will need to be worked out, the criteria established, and the funding sources identified. The design of the fund must be fit for purpose and not repeat the mistakes of other funds that are very difficult to access and take years,” said the ED, who was present in Egypt from November 6 to 18.

UnaMay Gordon, former principal director for the Climate Change Division of Jamaica and current chairperson of the Board of Directors of the CCCCC who herself has been on the frontlines at many global climate negotiations, agreed.

“This was a great step forward, but it is the first step. Eyes will now focus on the construction of the transitional committee and the beginning of their deliberations. I do hope the fight for loss and damage gets easier from here on,” she noted, fresh from her participation in the Egypt COP.

“It should not be so hard to agree on something everybody agrees needed to be addressed. But as I said earlier, good sense must prevail,” added Gordon.

AOSIS, meanwhile, has long championed financial support for loss and damage in the developing world and only last month published a briefing document detailing how a ‘fit-for-purpose multilateral fund designated as an operating entity of the UNFCCC Financial Mechanism’ should work.

AOSIS’ membership (roughly 39 countries) which includes Caribbean SIDS, have called for the design and operationalisation of the fund to include important concepts such as “climate justice” when taking action to address climate change as outlined in the Paris Agreement, and flagged the need for an operating entity that is built to provide predictable support for ex-post response to loss and damage.

Beyond that, AOSIS has maintained that the programming of support should take a “country-owned, country-driven, gender-responsive approach” and “with operational modalities that realise enhanced direct access, especially through existing regional and national entities”."

Reflecting a wide-spread view at the conference, Australia Climate and Energy minister Chris Bowen told delegates that multilateral development banks, including the World Bank, must adapt in the face of the climate challenge.

""Our international financial architecture is built for a different time and different challenges,"" he said.

""Some of our financial institutions are stepping up to this task, our most important global job, but others are not.""

ACCORDING to a recent KPMG report titled 'Net Zero Readiness Spotlight: Islands Report', small island economies, including those in the Caribbean, lack the funding necessary to significantly tackle climate change.

The report, which assesses 36 countries on their preparedness and ambition to achieve net zero, also asked decision-makers from 24 global investment institutions about the role of capital markets in climate change adaptation.

While the majority of the investors who were interviewed said that net zero is an essential feature of their investment portfolios, only 37 per cent have invested in small island economies (SIEs) so far and 63 per cent have yet to consider them as a favourable destination for their assets.

The report also revealed that a significant 83 per cent of capital owners are not aware of many investment opportunities associated with SIEs, with 63 per cent indicating that there is an insufficient track record on returns for such opportunities and thus a clear exit strategy is needed before committing capital.

""Now more than ever climate change is a growing concern for the Caribbean,"" said Raymond Campbell, head of advisory for KPMG in Caricom.

""Our ability as a region to attract capital to fund climate change mitigation and adaptation has never been more urgent, especially considering how our economies and livelihoods are affected by changing climate due to rising sea levels, increasingly frequent and more powerful storms, reduced access to drinking water and damage to ecosystems,"" he added.

To enhance the appeal of SIEs as a destination for climate-specific private capital, 88 per cent of investors say that they would like to see credible net zero national strategies and 67 per cent would like to see countries adopting international standards to monitor progress on blended finance projects.

A further 87 per cent are concerned about political instability, which could cause business instability and another 68 per cent perceive there to be a lack of projects on renewable energy and carbon sinks in SIEs.

On the matter of current climate change in Jamaica, the report highlights strategies that are being deployed.

""Jamaica has cut greenhouse gas emissions by 11 per cent between 2008-2018, they are working to introduce electric vehicles and is expanding their use of solar and wind power,"" the report explained.

The report also highlights that SIEs are on the right track, but climate change needs to be at the top of the agenda of every investor, government and business as the world unites to cut global warming to as close to zero as possible.

The Net Zero Readiness Spotlight: Islands report was developed by KPMG in collaboration with CREATE-Research."

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt — At the U.N. climate summit in Egypt, leaders of developing nations have repeatedly said it’s not fair to expect them to cover the costs of rebuilding from devastating weather events in a warming world, plus invest in cleaner industry while they also pay much higher interest rates on loans than rich nations.

A plan put forward by Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley would overhaul the way much of development lending works. It is also giving voice to developing nations struggling under rising debt from climate damage.

“We were the ones whose blood, sweat, and tears financed the Industrial Revolution,” Mottley said in a scathing address. “Are we now to face double jeopardy by having to pay the cost as a result of those greenhouse gases from the Industrial Revolution?”

Debt has been growing in developing countries, sapping funds for education, health and clean energy. Much of the increase in debt in some Caribbean countries is related to extreme storms, Mottley said in a recent essay. The plan would make it easier for countries in the Caribbean, Latin America, Africa and Asia to get funds to beef up defenses against warming and put off debt payments when disasters strike.

Here’s a look at the Barbados plan, dubbed the Bridgetown Initiative for the island nation’s capital. Advocates say it could be a pathway to unlocking $1 trillion in climate financing.

THE BIG IDEA

The plan calls for special loan clauses that allow for suspending payments when a country is hit by a natural disaster or pandemic. That would immediately free up millions of dollars for governments to spend on relief and rebuilding. Barbados has been a pioneer in such clauses, last month issuing its first sovereign bond with a provision allowing for payments to creditors to be deferred for up to two years if the country experiences a “pre-defined natural disaster.”

The initiative includes a push to expand lending by international development banks such as the World Bank. The bank and its sister institution, the International Monetary Fund, were set up after the Second World War with the aim of financing reconstruction and reducing poverty. The power of rich countries such as the United States and Germany is built into the institutions. But the World Bank in particular has been criticized for being too risk averse in lending. The Barbados plan would change risk ratings, crucially lowering interest rates.

Another idea is setting up a Climate Mitigation Trust backed by $500 billion worth of Special Drawing Rights, dues that member countries pay in to the IMF that can be drawn in times of crisis. Much of it is held by countries that don’t need it, said Avinash Persaud, Mottley’s special envoy for climate. The trust could be used to borrow a further $500 billion from the private sector that could be lent out at low rates for investment in big climate mitigation infrastructure projects. Up to $5 trillion in private financing could be unlocked this way, the plan’s architects say.

Other proposals include a levy on fossil fuel production or an international carbon border tax.

CREDITWORTHY

Mottley’s plan takes aim at a central problem: Poorer nations face much steeper borrowing costs.

When most wealthy countries borrow money, they pay 1 to 4% in interest, while countries in the so-called Global South face rates of 12-14%, Mottley told reporters.

“You begin to see the disparity,” Mottley said. “The system is broken.”

Following World War II, she said, victorious Allied nations agreed to cap Germany’s debt costs so that it could rebuild. Britain refinanced its First World War debt, paying off the last of it only in 2014.

“We are simply saying in the developing world that we also need the space to be able to finance our development in the case of climate,” Mottley said. Wealthy nations account for four fifths of global greenhouse gas emissions.

Hanan Morsy, chief economist at the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa, told The Associated Press that a number of the Bridgetown Initiative’s ideas also have been advanced by African finance ministers. He pointed out another financial inequity: The green bond market which helps finance environmental projects has reached $500 billion, but only one percent reaches Africa.

RICH NATIONS

Mottley first unveiled her idea at the COP26 meeting a year ago in Glasgow, Scotland. Over the summer she and Persaud convened economists, other academics and civil society groups to work on it.

Now, she said, momentum for her ideas is gathering.

French president Emmanuel Macron was the first leader from a rich country to give his backing.

“We need a huge financial shock of concessional financing,” Macron said in a speech at the opening of COP27. “We must change the rules, the rules of our major international banks, the development banks, the IMF and the World Bank,” he said. “We can’t wait for the next COP.”

To support Mottley’s plan, “a group of wise minds at the highest level” has been set up, tasked with drawing up climate financing solutions by spring 2023, when the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund hold their annual meetings, Macron said.

As climate-amped disasters ratchet up the suffering, the staid international system for finance designed for an earlier age may be on the brink of change, driven by those on the front lines.

Germany, the World Bank’s fourth largest shareholder, has been among those pushing for “fundamental reform,"" including “climate lending on better terms.” Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen said multilateral development banks need to “evolve"" and move beyond their traditional work of poverty reduction to tackle climate and other complex global challenges.

e0bf371b-09f9-467e-bec7-e4637038c1a4,"Details about the fund will need to be filled out at next year’s climate summit in the United Arab Emirates.

People in the summit meeting hall broke into loud applause and hugged when organizers announced the deal on climate payments, after an arduous final day and night of negotiating. It was a long-fought win for the countries that are burning, drowning and sweltering under the already-rampant impacts of global warming, and swept away decades of American and European opposition.

“It is a small victory for humankind,” said Avinash Persaud, special climate envoy to the prime minister of Barbados.

Only later did people read the complete final text, which had been prepared by the summit’s Egyptian hosts. That text included a message that “low-emission” energy should be part of the world’s response to rising seas and searing heat waves.

The term was vague enough to cover multiple interpretations – it certainly includes nuclear power, or some forms of hydrogen. But defenders of natural gas consistently note that it produces less carbon dioxide pollution than either coal or oil — though it still contributes to baking the planet.

The mention was slipped into the final version of the deal at the very last minute. Moments before delegates accepted the text, several negotiators POLITICO spoke to had not noticed the change.

“Absolutely it’s gas,” Li Shuo, a senior global policy adviser at Greenpeace East Asia, said of the new language.

Others weren’t so sure. An EU official said they would absolutely not define low emissions to include natural gas.

New Zealand Climate Change Minister James Shaw called it “a mystery” how the language slipped into the final text, and he downplayed the idea that it would give countries license to use gas. Still, he said the language could be read as including natural gas.

“The option of interpreting that way always existed, and countries have interpreted it that way,” he told reporters. “I don’t agree with it. But, you know, that’s kind of their interpretation.”

Asked by reporters whether “low-emission” energy excluded gas, Egyptian diplomat Wael Aboulmagd said: “Not necessarily, no.”

“It depends because every country is gonna have to utilize whatever sources of energy it has until it makes the transition” to cleaner sources, said Aboulmagd, who is the special representative to the climate summit’s Egyptian president.

The U.S. delegation declined to answer questions about what “low-emission” means. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

‘It does not address the yawning gap’

More broadly, the agreement includes few provisions that would hasten countries’ efforts to cut greenhouse gas pollution or shift away from fossil fuels. That’s another disappointment for climate advocates, who say the deal may consign even more communities to rising seas and worsening droughts and storms — which will then require more rounds of aid..

“You need substantially more funds and it will be immensely more expensive to adapt than to mitigate,” Norwegian Environment Minister Espen Barth Eide told reporters.

A senior Egyptian official said the lack of will to move faster stemmed from the absence of money to finance clean energy projects and adapt to rising seas and temperatures. Rich governments like the U.S. and EU have consistently underdelivered on that front.

Attempts during the talks to push for steeper carbon reductions fell flat in the face of resistance from large polluters and producers of fossil fuels, including Saudi Arabia and China. Oil- and gas-rich nations also squashed a push to widen a promised phasedown of coal burning to include all fossil fuels.

Meanwhile, scientific evidence is mounting that the world is falling far short of the kinds of carbon cuts needed to avert catastrophe.

“It does not bring a high degree of confidence,” European Commission Executive Vice President Frans Timmermans said of the final decision. “It does not address the yawning gap between climate science and climate policy.”

The U.S. bends to demands for a climate fund

The summit’s headlining deal — for the creation of a climate damage fund — came together after weeks of grumbling by developing nations about U.S. stinginess, a slight melting of frosty relations between Washington and Beijing, and a last-minute threat by European negotiators to abandon the talks.

Appearances by President Joe Biden and incoming Brazilian leader Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva punctuated the summit, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry came down with Covid-19 at the critical moment, and delegates complained about food shortages and a river of sewage that ran through the negotiation compound.

In swallowing the climate damage fund, the U.S. and the European Union were forced to break with decades of entrenched resistance to paying out for damage caused by their own greenhouse gas pollution — unwilling to be pinned for any form of liability. Transatlantic unity was tested and split by an organized bloc of 134 developing countries, mustered by flood-struck Pakistan.

The EU made a midweek switch to back the creation of a fund, further isolating the U.S., which eventually relented in a move that POLITICO reported early Saturday.

Later in the day, the European Commission’s Timmermans was claiming credit for a move “to bridge the gap between the different positions.” The Europeans’ maneuver, he said, “led to an opening.”

Filling the new fund with cash will be the next fight. The U.S. and other developed countries will be under pressure to pledge direct funding under the deal, which does not require congressional approval.

An EU official said the bloc will work next year to ensure that the agreement’s reference to “identifying and expanding sources of funding” is used to widen the donor base to include countries such as China and Saudi Arabia. The United Nations has traditionally categorized those countries as developing, despite their wealth and their status as major sources of carbon pollution.

China’s role has been a point of contention for the United States in these talks, even as Biden has tried to use the negotiations to try to reassert American leadership in the fight against catastrophic climate change. The deal is already facing criticism back home from Republicans, who have uniformly opposed Biden’s climate agenda and are due to take control of the House in January.

“Sending U.S. taxpayer dollars to a U.N. sponsored green slush fund is completely misguided,” Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), the top Republican on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said in a statement. “The Biden administration should focus on lowering spending at home, not shipping money to the U.N. for new climate deals.

“Innovation, not reparations, is key to fighting climate change,” he added.

But it’s not yet clear how the U.S. would fund any contribution, which may come from sources other than public government dollars.

In a statement after the summit, Kerry said the U.S. “welcomes” the creation of a fund, which he called a “voluntary funding” stream.

“The fund, which will be one among many available avenues for voluntary funding, should be designed to be effective and to attract an expanded donor base,” he said.

Floods, droughts and heatwaves helped fuel demands

The annual negotiations came against an inauspicious backdrop of war in Europe, food crises, spiking energy prices, spiraling debt in developing countries and icy relations between the world’s top two climate polluters, China and the United States. It had all the ingredients for failure and geopolitical score-settling.

All this global pain rode on the back of floods that displaced millions in Pakistan, Australia and Nigeria, heatwaves that left thousands dead in Europe and smashed records in China and climate-driven droughts that exacerbated food shortages.

Many of the poorest countries in the world came to Sharm El-Sheikh trapped in the hammer-and-anvil effects of these overlapping crises, and they proved unwilling to compromise on their demand for a new global fund. This fund will be part of a larger package of pots of money that countries including the U.S. had already agreed to finance, such as those aimed at providing humanitarian aid or a recently launched disaster insurance program called the Global Shield.

In addition, the deal asked the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund to investigate how they can contribute to the relief effort. The potential for really meaningful sums of capital to flow comes from these international lenders.

In fact, multilateral development banks could deliver billions of dollars to those in need if they pursued “aggressive” reforms and “took more risk, said Rachel Kyte, dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University and a former World Bank vice president.

Persaud, the adviser to Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley, said other sources of funding could include methane taxes, cross-border carbon taxes, and fossil fuel export levies.

On Saturday evening, Bangladeshi scientist and director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development Saleemul Huq was savoring the moment. He has waged a 30-year crusade to demand that the world recognize the harm that countries like his are sustaining, and that some of the responsibility of big polluters be returned in the form of financial support.

“It’s a historic win to get the fund. Now we need to build on it and make it actually deliver something to the people who are suffering,” he said.

Drama near the finale

The talks hit a final burst of turbulence Saturday morning when Timmermans, flanked by 13 stern-looking European ministers, threatened to storm out of the conference if negotiators didn’t meet the EU’s demands for stronger commitments to cut carbon pollution. Those demands included a schedule for countries to ramp up their national plans for countering climate change.

“I think our press conference this morning didn’t do any harm,” Irish Environment Minister Eamon Ryan told POLITICO. “And it was honest — the text we saw in the middle of last night wasn’t good text. It was just an honest assessment of it. So I think that did help.”

But the political theater turned out to be only so much shouting early when the summit’s Egyptian presidency presented a final decision document that made no advance on greenhouse-gas cuts beyond what came from last year’s climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland. Plus it added the hat tip to gas.

Holding onto the gains achieved in Glasgow “was like a battle,” said British Member of Parliament Alok Sharma, who had presided over those talks.

While this week’s negotiations went into overtime, the air conditioning did not. That left diplomats ironing out crucial details in sticky heat in their makeshift offices, where the canvas roofs and walls operated as virtual greenhouses.

Yet developing nations that have endured some of the worst of the converging global crises held firm against wealthy nations who demanded more aggressive pledges to curb emissions.

As the hot day gave way to night, negotiators for Saudi Arabia, China, India and other major developing countries huddled with Egyptian summit President Sameh Shoukry to discuss text for slashing greenhouse gas emissions, which remained fractious even hours after delegates cemented a deal on loss and damage payments.

The U.K. also joined.

The developing nations had been driving a hard line against future climate commitments across an array of economic sectors, which developed countries had sought. Sharma emerged from the Egyptian presidency’s offices stone-faced, walking stridently into a meeting where Shoukry was due to present what negotiators called his vision of a compromise.

That meeting turned into a three-hour airing of grievances. Fossil fuel heavyweights like Russia attempted to block language to phase out fossil fuels with unchecked emissions. The U.S. backed that phase-out language, said David Waskow, director of the World Resource Institute’s international climate initiative.

‘Would you like to join us?’

Talks grew tense. Sue Biniaz, the de facto U.S. lead with Kerry stuck in a hotel room, bolted after Shoukry when he briefly departed. The two chatted amidst a throng of security shadowing Shoukry, who turned away, leaving Biniaz standing expectantly. Shoukry then turned back: “Would you like to join us, Sue?” he said, then asked Biniaz to explain her objections to part of the deal as they ascended the ramp to his office.

During anonymous briefings throughout the summit’s second week, European officials had accused Shoukry of acting in the interests of a small group of countries heavily reliant on fossil fuels, including China and Saudi Arabia. An Egyptian official rejected that charge.

Friends and foes alike kept bringing up the United States’ failure to deliver its fair share of finance, undermining Biden’s tilt at leadership.

Then, after the EU changed its position and offered to support the creation of a new fund, the U.S. was left standing alone.

Late Friday, a revised payment proposal circulating at the conference site showed that U.S. resistance to creating a climate-damage fund appeared to be weakening. Just eight days after Biden boasted of his administration’s climate actions during a brief appearance on the summit’s stage, the U.S. had dropped its opposition to the talks’ most high-profile and vexing topic.

The U.S.-backed proposal didn’t go as far as an earlier one by the EU that aimed to meet calls from developing countries for a fund to help them recover from climate-fueled disasters.

But the U.S. had gone further than it planned or expected. Biden administration officials for weeks had expressed preference for an outcome that would first assess whether a new funding stream was even necessary, worrying that setting it up would be too cumbersome.

“The U.S. has had such anxiety about this for such a long time. They blocked even a conversation about it – they couldn’t even talk about it,” Shaw said. “And then it was like, ‘OK, let’s talk about it.’ Boom, two weeks later we’ve got a deal. I mean, that’s unprecedented.”

9945b8d9-1377-4702-bf10-3db1537d6ea0,"(SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt) — Negotiators early Sunday approved a historic deal that would create a fund for compensating poor nations that are victims of extreme weather worsened by rich countries’ carbon pollution, but an overall larger agreement still was up in the air because of a fight over emission reduction efforts.

After that vote, talks on other aspects of the negotiations were put on hold while delegates were given 30 minutes to read texts of other measures they were to vote on.

The decision establishes a fund for what negotiators call loss and damage. It is a big win for poorer nations which have long called for cash — sometimes viewed as reparations — because they are often the victims of climate worsened floods, droughts, heat waves, famines and storms despite having contributed little to the pollution that heats up the globe

“This is how a 30-year-old journey of ours has finally, we hope, found fruition today,” said Pakistan Climate Minister Sherry Rehman, who often took the lead for the world’s poorest nations. One-third of her nation was submerged this summer by a devastating flood and she and other officials used the motto: “What went on in Pakistan will not stay in Pakistan.”

Maldives Environment Minister Aminath Shauna told The AP Saturday “that means for countries like ours we will have the mosaic of solutions that we have been advocating for.”

It’s a reflection of what can be done when the poorest nations remain unified, said Alex Scott, a climate diplomacy expert at the think tank E3G.

“I think this is huge to have governments coming together to actually work out at least the first step of … how to deal with the issue of loss and damage,” Scott said. But like all climate financials, it is one thing to create a fund, it’s another to get money flowing in and out, she said. The developed world still has not kept its 2009 pledge to spend $100 billion a year in other climate aid — designed to help poor nations develop green energy and adapt to future warming.

The agreement “offers hope to the vulnerable people that they will get help to recover from climate disasters and rebuild their lives,” said Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy at Climate Action Network International.

The Egyptian presidency, which had been under criticism by all sides, proposed a new loss and damage deal Saturday afternoon and within a couple hours an agreement was struck, but Norway’s negotiator said it was not so much the Egyptians but countries working together.

Germany climate envoy Jennifer Morgan and Chilean Environment Minister Maisa Rojas, who shepherded the deal on to the agenda and to the finish line, hugged each other after passage, posed for a photo and said “yeah, we made it!”

According to the agreement, the fund would initially draw on contributions from developed countries and other private and public sources such as international financial institutions. While major emerging economies such as China would not initially be required to contribute, that option remains on the table and will be negotiated over the coming years. This is a key demand by the European Union and the United States, who argue that China and other large polluters currently classified as developing countries have the financial clout and responsibility to pay their way.

The fund would be largely aimed at the most vulnerable nations, though there would be room for middle-income countries that are severely battered by climate disasters to get aid.

Bleary-eyed rumpled delegations began to fill the plenary room 4 a.m. local time Sunday without seeing the overarching cover decision.

Going into the final session, battle lines were drawn over India’s request to change last year’s agreement that called for a phase down of “unabated coal” to include a phase down of oil and natural gas, two other fossil fuels that produce heat-trapping gases. While European nations and others keep pushing for that language, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Nigeria have been insistent on keeping it out.

“We are extremely on overtime. There were some good spirits earlier today. I think more people are more frustrated about the lack of progress,” Norwegian climate change minister Espen Barth Eide told The Associated Press. He said it came down to getting tougher on fossil fuel emissions and retaining the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times as was agreed in last year’s climate summit in Glasgow.

“Some of us are trying to say that we actually have to keep global warming under 1.5 degrees and that requires some action. We have to reduce our use of fossil fuels, for instance,” Eide said. “But there’s a very strong fossil fuel lobby … trying to block any language that we produce. So that’s quite clear.”

There was strong concern among both developed and developing countries about proposals on cutting greenhouse gas emissions, known as mitigation. Officials said the language put forward by Egypt backtracked on some of the commitments made at last year’s U.N. climate conference in Glasgow aimed at keeping alive the target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times. The world has already warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) since the mid 19th century.

Some of the Egyptian language on mitigation seemingly reverted to the 2015 Paris agreement, which was before scientists knew how crucial the 1.5 degree threshold was and heavily mentioned a weaker 2-degree Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) goal, which is why scientists and Europeans are afraid of backtracking, said climate scientist Maarten van Aalst of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre.

Ireland’s Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan said: “We need to get a deal on 1.5 degrees. We need strong wording on mitigation and that’s what we’re going to push.”

Still, the attention centered around the compensation fund, which has also been called a justice issue.

It’s a reflection of what can be done when the poorest nations remain unified, said Alex Scott, a climate diplomacy expert at the think tank E3G.

“I think this is huge to have governments coming together to actually work out at least the first step of … how to deal with the issue of loss and damage,” Scott said. But like all climate financials, it is one thing to create a fund, it’s another to get money flowing in and out, she said. The developed world still has not kept its 2009 pledge to spend $100 billion a year in other climate aid — designed to help poor nations develop green energy and adapt to future warming.

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt — For the first time the nations of the world decided to help pay for the damage that climate change has done to poor countries, but they finished marathon climate talks on Sunday with a deal that does more to address the impacts of the burning of fossil fuels than actually fight climate change’s root cause.

The agreement struck in this Egyptian Red Sea resort city is a victory for developing nations that have for decades fought for some form of compensation for the “loss and damage” they’re suffering due to floods, droughts, famine, heat waves and storms worsened by climate change despite emitting a small fraction of heat-trapping carbon pollution.

It is also long been called an issue of climate justice.

“Today, the international community has restored global faith in this critical process that is dedicated to ensuring no one is left behind,” said Antigua and Barbuda’s Molwyn Joseph, who chairs the organization of small island states that has been vocal on loss and damage. “The agreements made at COP27 are a win for our entire world. We have shown those who have felt neglected that we hear you, we see you, and we are giving you the respect and care you deserve.”

A deal of sorts came after a game of climate change chicken over the cause of warming: fossil fuel burning.

Early Sunday morning, delegates approved the compensation fund but had not dealt with the contentious issues of an overall temperature goal, emissions cutting and the desire to target all fossil fuels for phase down. As dawn was breaking the European Union and other nations fought back what they considered backsliding in Egyptian presidency’s overarching cover agreement and threatened to scuttle the rest of the process.

The package was revised again and this time didn’t have what the Europeans would consider backsliding.

“It’s not as strong as we would like it to be but it does not break” with what was decided at last year’s UN climate conference, said Norway Climate Minister Espen Barth Eide. “It does not raise ambition further so that’s something we have to work with in COP28″ next year.

This year’s talks “were very focused on the fund and less on the mitigation (cutting emissions) part,” Eide added.

The agreement includes a veiled reference to the benefits of natural gas as low emission energy, despite many nations calling for a phase down of natural gas, which does contribute to climate change.

The new agreement does not ratchet up calls for reducing emissions. But it does retain language to keep alive the global goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-industrial times. The Egyptian presidency kept offering proposals that harkened back to 2015 Paris language which also mentioned a looser goal of 2 degrees. The world has already warmed 1.1 degrees (2 degrees Fahrenheit).

Nor does the deal expand on last year’s call to phase down global use of “unabated coal” even though India and other countries pushed to include oil and natural gas in language from Glasgow. That too was the subject of last minute debate.

However, that fight was overshadowed by the historic compensation fund.

Harjeet Singh of the environmental group Climate Action Network International said the new fund had effectively “sent a warning shot to polluters that they can no longer go scot-free with their climate destruction.”

“From now on, they will have to pay up for the damages they cause and are accountable to the people who are facing supercharged storms, devastating floods and rising seas,” he said.

Outside experts hailed the decision as historic.

“This loss and damage fund will be a lifeline for poor families whose houses are destroyed, farmers whose fields are ruined, and islanders forced from their ancestral homes,” said Ani Dasgupta, president of the environmental think tank World Resources Institute, minutes after the early morning approval. “This positive outcome from COP27 is an important step toward rebuilding trust with vulnerable countries.”

“Quite a few positives to celebrate amidst the gloom and doom” of not cutting emissions fast enough to limit warming to 1.5 degrees, said climate scientist Maarten van Aalst of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Center, which responds to climate disasters.

It’s a reflection of what can be done when the poorest nations remain unified, said Alex Scott, a climate diplomacy expert at the think tank E3G.

“I think this is huge to have governments coming together to actually work out at least the first step of ... how to deal with the issue of loss and damage,” Scott said. But like all climate financials, it is one thing to create a fund, it’s another to get money flowing in and out, she said. The developed world still has not kept its 2009 pledge to spend $100 billion a year in other climate aid — designed to help poor nations develop green energy and adapt to future warming.

“Loss and damage is a way of both recognizing past harm and compensating for that past harm,” said Dartmouth climate scientist Justin Mankin, who calculated dollar amounts for each country’s warming. “These harms are scientifically identifiable.”

“In many ways we’re talking about reparations,” said University of Maryland environmental health and justice professor Sacoby Wilson. “It’s an appropriate term to use” he said, because the rich northern countries got the benefits of fossil fuels, while the poorer global south gets the damage in floods, droughts, climate refugees and hunger.

The Egyptian presidency, which had been under criticism by all sides, proposed a new loss and damage deal Saturday afternoon and within a couple hours an agreement was struck, but Norway’s negotiator said it was not so much the Egyptians but countries working together.

Germany climate envoy Jennifer Morgan and Chilean Environment Minister Maisa Rojas, who shepherded the deal on to the agenda and to the finish line, hugged each other after passage, posed for a photo and said “yeah, we made it!”

According to the agreement, the fund would initially draw on contributions from developed countries and other private and public sources such as international financial institutions. While major emerging economies such as China would not initially be required to contribute, that option remains on the table and will be negotiated over the coming years. This is a key demand by the European Union and the United States, who argue that China and other large polluters currently classified as developing countries have the financial clout and responsibility to pay their way.

The fund would be largely aimed at the most vulnerable nations, though there would be room for middle-income countries that are severely battered by climate disasters to get aid.

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt (Reuters) - Countries closed this year's U.N. climate summit on Sunday with a hard-fought deal to create a fund to help poor countries being battered by climate disasters, even as many lamented its lack of ambition in tackling the emissions causing them.

The deal was widely lauded as a triumph for responding to the devastating impact that global warming is already having on vulnerable countries. But many countries said they felt pressured to give up on tougher commitments for limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius in order for the landmark deal on the loss and damage fund to go through.

Delegates - worn out after intense, overnight negotiations - made no objections as Egypt’s COP27 President Sameh Shoukry rattled through the final agenda items and gavelled the deal through.

Despite having no agreement for a stronger commitment to the 1.5 C goal set in the 2015 Paris Agreement, ""we went with what the agreement was here because we want to stand with the most vulnerable,"" Germany's climate secretary Jennifer Morgan, visibly shaken, told Reuters.

When asked by Reuters whether the goal of stronger climate-fighting ambition had been compromised for the deal, Mexico's chief climate negotiator Camila Zepeda summed up the mood among exhausted negotiators.

""Probably. You take a win when you can.""

LOSS AND DAMAGE

The deal for a loss and damage fund marked a diplomatic coup for small islands and other vulnerable nations in winning over the 27-nation European Union and the United States, which had long resisted the idea for fear that such a fund could open them to legal liability for historic emissions.

Those concerns were assuaged with language in the agreement calling for the funds to come from a variety of existing sources, including financial institutions, rather than relying on rich nations to pay in.

The climate envoy from the Marshall Islands said she was ""worn out"" but happy with the fund's approval. ""So many people all this week told us we wouldn't get it,"" Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner said. ""So glad they were wrong.""

But it likely will be several years before the fund exists, with the agreement setting out only a roadmap for resolving lingering questions including who would oversee the fund, how the money would be dispersed – and to whom.

U.S. special climate envoy John Kerry, who was not at the weekend negotiations in person after testing positive for COVID-19, on Sunday welcomed the deal to ""establish arrangements to respond to the devastating impact of climate change on vulnerable communities around the world.""

In a statement, he said he would continue to press major emitters like China to ""significantly enhance their ambition"" in keeping the 1.5 C goal alive.

FOSSIL FUEL FIZZLE

The price paid for a deal on the loss and damage fund was most evident in the language around emission reductions and reducing the use of polluting fossil fuels – known in the parlance of U.N. climate negotiations as ""mitigation.""

Last year's COP26 summit in Glasgow, Scotland, had focused on a theme of keeping the 1.5C goal alive – as scientists warn that warming beyond that threshold would see climate change spiral to extremes.

Countries were asked then to update their national climate targets before this year’s Egypt summit. Only a fraction of the nearly 200 parties did so.

While praising the loss and damage deal, many countries decried COP27’s failure to push mitigation further and said some countries were trying to roll back commitments made in the Glasgow Climate Pact.

""We had to fight relentlessly to hold the line of Glasgow,"" a visibly frustrated Alok Sharma, architect of the Glasgow deal, told the summit.

He listed off a number of ambition-boosting measures that were stymied in the negotiations for the final COP27 deal in Egypt: ""Emissions peaking before 2025 as the science tells us is necessary? Not in this text. Clear follow-through on the phase down of coal? Not in this text. A clear commitment to phase out all fossil fuels? Not in this text.""

On fossil fuels, the COP27 deal text largely repeats wording from Glasgow, calling up parties to accelerate ""efforts towards the phasedown of unabated coal power and phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies.""

Efforts to include a commitment to phase out, or at least phase down, all fossil fuels were thwarted.

A separate ""mitigation work programme"" agreement, also approved on Sunday, contained several clauses that some parties, including the European Union, felt weakened commitment to ever more ambitious emissions-cutting targets.

Critics pointed to a section which they said undermined the Glasgow commitment to regularly renew emissions targets – with language saying the work programme would ""not impose new targets or goals"". Another section of the COP27 deal dropped the idea of annual target renewal in favour of returning to a longer five-year cycle set out in the Paris pact.

""It is more than frustrating to see overdue steps on mitigation and the phase-out of fossil energies being stonewalled by a number of large emitters and oil producers,"" German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said.

The deal also included a reference to ""low-emissions energy,"" raising concern among some that it opened the door to the growing use of natural gas - a fossil fuel that leads to both carbon dioxide and methane emissions.

""It does not break with Glasgow completely, but it doesn't raise ambition at all,"" Norway's Climate Minister Espen Barth Eide told reporters.

The climate minister of the Maldives, which faces future inundation from climate-driven sea level rise, lamented the lack of ambition on curbing emissions.

""I recognise the progress we made in COP27"" with the loss and damage fund, Aminath Shauna told the plenary. But ""we have failed on mitigation ... We have to ensure that we increase ambition to peak emissions by 2025. We have to phase out fossil fuel.""

39560aa1-bf2b-4a7e-b7fe-a1341f1b091f,"The head of the Egyptian delegation praised the outcome of the summit and the deal on a fund for poor, vulnerable nations for the loss and damage caused by climate change.

“People thought that (a deal on a loss and damage fund) was impossible and managed to get that done,” said Wael Aboulmagd.

“It was emotional for a lot of people, this struggle, people on the front lines of the war on climate and they’re suffering most. But it was very important and it wasn’t easy. But we’re really happy that it actually happened here in Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt,” he said.

New Zealand’s climate change minister called the deal on a loss and damage fund “a great result” but expressed deep concerns over the lack of consensus for stronger wording on cutting emissions.

James Shaw blamed “a group of countries” that are “fighting very hard to unwind the decisions that we made” in previous conferences on global average temperature warming limits for stalling talks.

“This has been a constant of the talks for many years, but it really came to the fore this at this COP and I’m afraid there was just a massive battle which ultimately neither side won,” he said. ___

Maldives’ environment minister said the agreement on creating a fund for developing nations hard hit by climate change made worse by rich countries’ emissions has created “a new compact of trust” between developed and developing nations.

But the loss and damage fund was not enough, said Aminath Shauna, who also wanted to see stronger language on slashing emissions.

“I am disheartened we did not get there. Why are we trying to address loss and damage? Because we have failed on mitigation and adaptation,” Shauna said.

“We have just 86 months to fix this. The longer we wait, the costlier it will be.”

___

The deal “responded to the voices of the vulnerable, the damaged and the lost of the whole world by establishing a fund for the lost and the damaged,” said Pakistan environment minister Sherry Rehman, speaking for a coalition of the world’s poorest nations.

“We have struggled for 30 years on this path. And today, in Sharm el-Sheikh, this journey has achieved its first positive milestone. The establishment of a fund is not about dispensing charity. It is clearly a down payment on the longer investment in our joint futures.”

___

Last year’s climate talks president, the United Kingdom’s Alok Sharma, criticized this year’s summit leadership for knocking down his efforts to do more to cut emissions with a forceful listing of what was not done.

“We joined with many parties to propose a number of measures that would have contributed to this. Emissions peaking before 2025, as the science tells us is necessary. Not in this text,” the United Kingdom’s Alok Sharma said, emphasizing the last sentence. “Clear follow through on the phase down of coal. Not in this text. A clear commitment to phase out all fossil fuels. Not in this text. And the energy text weakened in the final minutes.”

___

“This is the make or break decade, but what we have in front of us is not enough of a step forward for people and planet,” a disappointed Frans Timmermans, executive vice president of the European Union told his fellow negotiators. “It does not bring enough added efforts from major emitters to increase and accelerate their emissions cuts.

“We have all fallen short in actions to avoid and minimize loss and damage,” Timmermans said. “We should have done much more.”

___

“It wasn’t easy at all,” said U.N. Climate Chief Simon Stiell. “We worked around the clock. But this outcome does move us forward” and he said it for the first time addresses “the impacts on communities whose lives and livelihoods have been ruined by the very worst impacts of climate change.”

___

The deal will help “save our planet from the threat of climate change and turn this climate challenge into an opportunity for growth and development in a just, equitable, inclusive and balanced manner,” said the summit president Sameh Shoukry, the Egyptian foreign minister.

___

“I’m proud I got to be here to witness this happen and contribute in a small way,” said Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner, Climate Envoy of the Marshall Islands. “Worn out but so worth it to protect already disappearing islets, shorelines and culture. So many people all this week told us we wouldn’t get it. So glad they were wrong.”

But she added: “I wish we got fossil fuel phase out. The current text is not enough. But we’ve shown with the loss and damage fund that we can do the impossible. So we know we can come back next year and get rid of fossil fuels once and for all.”

___

Martin Kaiser, the head of Greenpeace Germany, described the agreement on loss and damage as a “small plaster on a huge, gaping wound.”

“It’s a scandal that the Egyptian COP presidency gave petrostates such as Saudi Arabia space to torpedo effective climate protection. They have prevented a clear decision on the urgently needed phaseout of coal, oil and gas,” he said, adding that the meeting “carelessly risks adherence to the 1.5-degree limit.”

___

Harjeet Singh of the environmental group Climate Action Network International said the new fund had effectively “sent a warning shot to polluters that they can no longer go scot-free with their climate destruction.”

“From now on, they will have to pay up for the damages they cause and are accountable to the people who are facing supercharged storms, devastating floods and rising seas,” he said.

dad27f70-6387-4308-97ec-b2ef3333e472,"SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt — For the first time, the nations of the world decided to help pay for the damage an overheating world is inflicting on poor countries, but they finished marathon climate talks on Sunday without further addressing the root cause of those disasters — the burning of fossil fuels.

The deal, gaveled around dawn in this Egyptian Red Sea resort city, established a fund for what negotiators call loss and damage.

It was a big win for poorer nations which have long called for money — sometimes viewed as reparations — because they are often the victims of climate-worsened floods, droughts, heat waves, famines and storms despite having contributed little to the pollution that heats up the globe.

It has also long been called an issue of equity for nations hit by weather extremes and small island states that face an existential threat from rising seas.

""Three long decades and we have finally delivered climate justice,"" said Seve Paeniu, the finance minister of Tuvalu. ""We have finally responded to the call of hundreds of millions of people across the world to help them address loss and damage.""

Pakistan's environment minister, Sherry Rehman, said the establishment of the fund ""is not about dispensing charity.""

""It is clearly a down payment on the longer investment in our joint futures,"" she said, speaking for a coalition of the world's poorest nations.

Antigua and Barbuda's Molwyn Joseph, who chairs the organization of small island states, described the agreement as a ""win for our entire world.""

""We have shown those who have felt neglected that we hear you, we see you, and we are giving you the respect and care you deserve,"" he said.

The deal followed a game of chicken, with nations that supported the fund also signaling they would walk away if there was any backsliding on language on the need to slash greenhouse gas emissions.

Early Sunday morning, delegates approved the compensation fund but had not dealt with the contentious issues of an overall temperature goal, emissions cutting and the desire to target all fossil fuels for phase down. Through the wee hours of the night, the European Union and other nations fought back what they considered backsliding in the Egyptian presidency's overarching cover agreement and threatened to scuttle the rest of the process.

The package was revised again, removing most of the elements Europeans had objected to but adding none of the heightened ambition they were hoping for.

""What we have in front of us is not enough of a step forward for people and planet,"" a disappointed Frans Timmermans, executive vice president of the European Union, told his fellow negotiators. ""It does not bring enough added efforts from major emitters to increase and accelerate their emissions cuts.

""We have all fallen short in actions to avoid and minimize loss and damage,"" Timmermans said. ""We should have done much more.""

Germany's Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock likewise voiced frustration.

""It is more than frustrating to see overdue steps on mitigation and the phase-out of fossil energies being stonewalled by a number of large emitters and oil producers,"" she said.

Next year's talks will also see further negotiations to work out details of the new loss and damage fund, as well as review the world's efforts to meet the goals of the Paris accord, which scientists say are slipping out of reach.

According to the agreement, the fund would initially draw on contributions from developed countries and other private and public sources such as international financial institutions.

It’s the first time the issue has been discussed at a major summit.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres recently warned the world was headed for “climate chaos” as he urged world leaders to commit to cutting emissions.

However, there are still fears that the target of curbing global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial times in line with the Paris Agreement, may still not be upheld.

“The 1.5°C figure is not some random statistic,” Secretary-General of the United Nations World Meteorological Organization, Petteri Taalas recently said.

Bleary-eyed rumpled delegations began to fill the plenary room about 4am local time on Sunday without seeing the overarching cover decision.

Going into the final session, battle lines were drawn over India’s request to change last year’s agreement that called for a phase down of “unabated coal” to include a phase down of oil and natural gas, two other fossil fuels that produce heat-trapping gases. While European nations and others keep pushing for that language, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Nigeria have been insistent on keeping it out. “We are extremely on overtime. There were some good spirits earlier today. I think more people are more frustrated about the lack of progress,” Norwegian climate change minister Espen Barth Eide told The Associated Press. He said it came down to getting tougher on fossil fuel emissions and retaining the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times as was agreed in last year’s climate summit in Glasgow. “Some of us are trying to say that we actually have to keep global warming under 1.5 degrees and that requires some action. We have to reduce our use of fossil fuels, for instance,” Eide said. “But there’s a very strong fossil fuel lobby ... trying to block any language that we produce. So that’s quite clear.” The United States, which in the past has been reluctant to even talk about the issue of loss and damage, “is working to sign on”, said an official close to negotiations. If an agreement is accepted it still needs to be approved in a unanimous decision on Sunday. But other parts of a deal, outlined in a package of proposals put out earlier in the day by the Egyptian chairs of the talks, are still being hammered out as negotiators head into what they hope is their final session.

There was strong concern among both developed and developing countries about proposals on cutting greenhouse gas emissions, known as mitigation. Officials said the language put forward by Egypt backtracked on some of the commitments made in Glasgow aimed at keeping alive the target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times. The world has already warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius since the mid 19th century. Loading Some of the Egyptian language on mitigation seemingly reverted to the 2015 Paris agreement, which was before scientists knew how crucial the 1.5 degree threshold was and heavily mentioned a weaker 2-degree Celsius goal, which is why scientists and Europeans are afraid of backtracking, said climate scientist Maarten van Aalst of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre. Ireland’s Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan said: “We need to get a deal on 1.5 degrees. We need strong wording on mitigation and that’s what we’re going to push.” Still, the attention centred around the compensation fund, which has also been called a justice issue.

It’s a reflection of what can be done when the poorest nations remain unified, said Alex Scott, a climate diplomacy expert at the think tank E3G. “I think this is huge to have governments coming together to actually work out at least the first step of ... how to deal with the issue of loss and damage,” Scott said. But like all climate financials, it is one thing to create a fund, it’s another to get money flowing in and out, she said. The developed world still has not kept its 2009 pledge to spend $US100 billion a year in other climate aid – designed to help poor nations develop green energy and adapt to future warming. “The draft decision on loss and damage finance offers hope to the vulnerable people that they will get help to recover from climate disasters and rebuild their lives,” said Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy at Climate Action Network International. The Chinese lead negotiator would not comment on a possible deal. European negotiators said they were ready to back the deal but declined to say so publicly until the entire package was approved. The Egyptian presidency, which had been under criticism by all sides, proposed a new loss and damage deal on Saturday afternoon and within a couple of hours an agreement was struck but Norway’s Eide said it was not so much the Egyptians but countries working together."

Countries have adopted a hard-fought final agreement at the COP27 climate summit that sets up a fund to help poor countries being battered by natural disasters – but does not boost efforts to tackle the emissions causing them.

After tense negotiations that ran through the night, the Egyptian COP27 presidency released the final text for a deal and simultaneously called a plenary session to quickly pass it.

The swift approval for creating a dedicated loss and damage fund left many of the most controversial decisions on the fund until next year, including who should pay into it.

Negotiators made no objections as COP27 President Sameh Shoukry rattled through the final agenda items.

‘We want to stand with most vulnerable’

By the time dawn broke over the summit venue in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh on Sunday, the deal was done.

Despite having no agreement for tougher emissions reductions, “we went with what the agreement was here because we want to stand with the most vulnerable”, Germany’s climate secretary Jennifer Morgan said.

Delegates praised the breakthrough in setting up the fund, calling it climate justice for its aim of helping vulnerable countries cope with storms, floods and other disasters fuelled by rich nations’ carbon emissions.

Asked whether the goal of stronger climate-fighting ambition had been compromised for the deal, Mexico’s chief climate negotiator Camila Zepeda summed up the mood among exhausted negotiators.

“Probably. You take a win when you can,” she said.

Test of global resolve to fight climate change

The two-week summit has been seen as a test of global resolve to fight climate change – as a war in Europe, energy market turmoil and rampant consumer inflation distract international attention.

Billed as the “African COP”, the summit had promised to highlight the plight of poor countries facing the most severe consequences from global warming caused mainly by wealthy, industrialised nations.

The United States also supported the loss and damage provision but climate envoy John Kerry did not attend the session after testing positive for COVID-19.

Negotiators from the European Union and other countries had said they were worried about efforts to block measures to strengthen last year’s Glasgow Climate Pact.

“It is more than frustrating to see overdue steps on mitigation and the phase-out of fossil energies being stonewalled by a number of large emitters and oil producers,” German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said in a statement.

No reference to phase down use of ‘all fossil fuels’

The approved deal did not contain a reference requested by India and other delegations to phase down the use of “all fossil fuels”.

Instead, it called on countries to take steps toward “the phase down of unabated coal power and phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies” as agreed at the COP26 Glasgow summit.

“Too many parties are not ready to make more progress today in the fight against climate crisis,” EU climate policy chief Frans Timmermans said, describing the deal as “not enough of a step forward for people and planet”.

The text included a reference to “low-emissions energy”, raising concern it opened the door to the growing use of natural gas – a fossil fuel that leads to both carbon dioxide and methane emissions.

Final agreement ‘doesn’t raise ambition’

“It does not break with Glasgow completely but it doesn’t raise ambition at all,” Norway’s Climate Minister Espen Barth Eide told reporters.

Small island nations facing a climate-driven rise in sea level had pushed for the loss and damage deal but lamented the lack of ambition on curbing emissions.

“I recognise the progress we made in COP27” in establishing the fund … but “we have failed on mitigation”, Maldives climate minister Aminath Shauna told the plenary.

“We have to ensure that we increase ambition to peak emissions by 2025,” she said.

“We have to phase out fossil fuel.”

db869dd3-42da-4f59-bbf0-4c2b4a386749,"Developing countries celebrated on Sunday morning as crucial climate talks ended with a “historic” deal on their most cherished climate goal: a global fund for “loss and damage”, providing financial assistance to poor nations stricken by climate disaster.

However, the deal was far from perfect, with several key elements flawed or lacking. Some countries said the commitments on limiting temperatures to 1.5C represented no progress on the Cop26 conference in Glasgow last year, and the language on phasing out fossil fuels was weak.

Sameh Shoukry, the Egyptian foreign minister and president of the Cop27 UN climate summit in Egypt, said: “We rose to the occasion. We worked around the clock, day and night, but united in working for one gain, one higher purpose, one common goal. In the end we delivered. We listened to the calls of anguish and despair.”

Sherry Rehman – climate change minister of Pakistan where suffering in record floods in September became emblematic of the devastation developing countries are facing – hailed the “historic” loss and damage deal to applause in the conference hall.

“This is not about accepting charity,” she said. “This is a down payment on investment in our futures, and in climate justice.”

Simon Stiell, the UN climate chief, told exhausted delegates as the gavel was brought down on the final deal at 7am, after an all-night negotiating session: “It wasn’t easy at all. But this outcome will benefit the most vulnerable around the world.”

But he warned that time was short to take action on the targets agreed, and there was “no room for backsliding”. He said the national plans that countries had submitted on cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 were not enough to meet the vital goal of limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, in line with scientific advice. “The [national plans] just don’t add up,” he said. “Keep your eye on 2030. That is our horizon.”

Poor countries and climate campaigners rejoiced. Sir Molwyn Joseph, minister of health, wellbeing and the environment of Antigua and Barbuda, and chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, said: “Today, the international community has restored global faith in this critical process that is dedicated to ensuring no one is left behind. The agreements made at Cop27 are a win for our entire world. We have shown those who have felt neglected that we hear you, we see you, and we are giving you the respect and care you deserve. We must work even harder to hold firm to the 1.5C warming limit, to operationalise the loss and damage fund, and continue to create a world that is safe, fair, and equitable for all.”

The two-week long conference in Sharm El-Sheikh ran more than 36 hours over its Friday night deadline, and was marked by stark division and harsh words between the rich and the poor.

At many stages, a deal looked impossible to reach. In the final hours, countries wrangled over single words in an outcome that spanned issues from the 1.5C temperature goal, the phasing out of fossil fuels, the needs and rights of indigenous people, the protection of nature, and how to engineer a “just transition” to clean energy for those economically dependent on fossil fuels.

Many felt the deal fell well short on important issues. Frans Timmermans, vice-president of the European Commission, spoke of the tortuous negotiations, which included some countries trying to unpick the 1.5C goal, and to abolish the requirement established in Glasgow for countries to update their plans on emissions every year.

“Too many parties are not ready to make more progress today in the fight against the climate crisis,” he warned. “There were too many attempts to roll back what we agreed in Glasgow. This deal is not enough [on cutting emissions].”

Timmermans said the language on 1.5C was too weak. “We are disappointed we didn’t achieve [more],” he said. “We have all fallen short.”

Alok Sharma, the UK’s president of Cop26, spoke in clear frustration of having to defend commitments agreed last year from sustained attack by other countries. “We had to fight relentlessly to hold the line,” he said. “We had to battle to build on the key outcomes of Glasgow.”

He listed commitments that he championed that were removed at the behest of laggard countries and fossil fuel producers: “Peaking emissions by 2025 is not in this text. Follow-through on the phasedown of coal is not in this text. The phasedown of all fossil fuels is not in this text,” he said. “The text on energy was weakened but is at least in. 1.5C was weak, and it remains on life support.”

A proposal from India to stipulate the phasing down of all fossil fuels was also mauled by oil-producing countries at the talks, and watered down to a phasing down of coal, which reflected exactly the commitment made in Glasgow. The wording was the subject of furious discussions in the early hours of Sunday morning.

But in the end, as dawn broke over the Red Sea, the Egyptian hosts drafted a compromise deal that achieved the consensus required under the UN rules. Shoukry said: “We leave with stronger collective will and determination.”

He said the 1.5C temperature limit remained within reach, and countries must work on staying within that limit. He added that it was appropriate that the loss and damage fund was agreed in Africa.

Loss and damage refers to the most severe impacts of extreme weather on the physical and social infrastructure of poor countries, and the financial assistance needed to rescue and rebuild them.

It was the most contentious issue at the conference, and has been a long-running demand by developing countries since 1992. For nearly two weeks, the EU and the US refused demands from poor countries for a new fund to address loss and damage, arguing that existing funds should be redirected for the purpose. Early on Friday morning, the EU made a U-turn, to agree to a fund on condition that big economies and big emitters still classed as developing countries under the UNFCCC rules, which date back to 1992, should be included as potential donors, and excluded as recipients.

Many poor countries and campaigners saw this as an attempt to divide the neediest developing countries from bigger economies such as China, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states, and strongly resisted.

That row took up most of the remaining negotiating time on Friday and Saturday, and the US only signalled its agreement to the fund on Saturday. But the compromise – by which the vulnerable will be prioritised, and the door is open to voluntary contributions from countries still classed as developing – was agreed in the early hours of Sunday morning.

It is likely to take at least a year, until the next climate conference of the parties in United Arab Emirates in November 2023, to sort through some of the details of how the fund can work. There is also, so far, little money for the fund, as few nations have made significant pledges of cash for loss and damage.

Antonio Guterres, the UN secretary-general, said the fund was “an important step towards justice” for poor countries that have done little to cause the climate crisis, but are suffering its worst impacts.

“I welcome the decision to establish a loss and damage fund and to operationalise it in the coming period,” Guterres said. “Clearly this will not be enough, but it is a much-needed political signal to rebuild broken trust. The voices of those on the frontlines of the climate crisis must be heard.”"
630c7736-cd4b-4198-b366-84d50fd18e08,"The agreement hammered out in the Red Sea resort town says nations cannot be held legally liable for payments. The deal calls for a committee with representatives from 24 countries to work over the next year to figure out exactly what form the fund should take, which countries should contribute and where the money should go.

Many of the other details are still to be determined.

The creation of a loss and damage fund was almost derailed by disputes that ran into the dawn hours of Sunday over other elements of a broader agreement, including how deeply countries should cut their emissions and whether to include language that explicitly called for a phase-out of fossil fuels, including coal, natural gas and oil.

The European Union and other nations fought back what they considered backsliding in the Egyptian presidency’s overarching cover agreement and threatened to scuttle the rest of the process.

The package was revised again, and this time didn’t have what the Europeans would consider backsliding. But Europeans were far from satisfied. The agreement includes a veiled reference to the benefits of natural gas as low emission energy, despite many nations calling for a phase down of natural gas.

The new agreement does not ratchet up calls for reducing emissions. But it does retain language to keep alive the global goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial times.

“What we have in front of us is not enough of a step forward for people and planet,” a disappointed Frans Timmermans, executive vice-president of the European Union, said. “It does not bring enough added efforts from major emitters to increase and accelerate their emissions cuts.”

“We should have done much more,” Mr Timmermans said.

Developing nations – largely from Asia, Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean and South Pacific – fought first to place the loss and damage fund on the formal agenda of the two-week summit.

And then they were relentless in their pressure campaign, arguing that it was a matter of justice, noting they did little to contribute to a crisis that threatens their existence.

“The announcement offers hope to vulnerable communities all over the world who are fighting for their survival from climate stress,” said Sherry Rehman, Pakistan’s minister for climate change. “And gives some credibility to the COP process.”

Pakistan spearheaded a group of 134 developing nations pushing for loss and damage payments. Pakistan this year suffered devastating flooding that scientists say was made worse by global warming, resulting in more than 1500 deaths.

China not eligible

As the summit was nearing an end, the European Union consented to the idea of a loss and damage fund, although it insisted any aid should be focused on the most vulnerable nations, and that aid might include a wide variety of options such as new insurance programs in addition to direct payments.

That left the United States, which has pumped more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than any nation in history, as the last big holdout. By Saturday, as talks stretched into overtime, US officials said that they would accept a loss and damage fund, breaking the logjam.

Still, major hurdles remain.

The US and the EU are pushing for assurances that China will eventually contribute to any fund created – and that China would not be eligible to receive money from it.

The United Nations currently classifies China as a developing country, which would make it eligible for climate compensation, even though it is now the world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases as well as the second-largest economy. China has fiercely resisted being treated as a developed nation in global climate talks.

There is also no guarantee that wealthy countries will deposit money into the fund. A decade ago, the United States, the European Union and other wealthy emitters pledged to mobilise $US100 billion ($150 billion) per year in climate finance by 2020 to help poorer countries shift to clean energy and adapt to future climate risks through measures like building sea walls. They are still falling short by tens of billions of dollars annually.

While US diplomats agreed to a fund, money must be appropriated by Congress.

Last year, the Biden administration sought $US2.5 billion in climate finance but secured just $US1 billion, and that was when Democrats controlled both chambers. With Republicans, who largely oppose climate aid, set to take over the House in January, the prospects of Congress approving an entirely new pot of money for loss and damage appear dim.

For their part, a variety of European nations have voluntarily pledged more than $US300 million to address loss and damage so far, with most of that money going toward a new insurance program to help countries recover from disasters like flooding.

As researchers in physical activity sciences, we are proposing to shed some light on the impacts of climate change on the future of soccer.

Soccer: Victim of, or contributor to climate change?

The combination of historical data and current emission scenarios reveals that rising sea levels, intensified heat waves, increased risk of megafires, floods and deteriorating air quality all pose major threats to both amateur and professional soccer. However, soccer is not just a victim of climate change. It is also a significant contributor to it, as demonstrated by the annual carbon footprint of Premier League (English Football Championship) players, estimated at 29 tonnes of CO₂ equivalent – and that is just for the travel entailed.

This is nearly three times the annual carbon footprint of UK citizens, and far exceeds the global target of two tonnes per person, set to meet the commitments of the Paris Agreement (COP21).

Heat, weather and flooding: What are the impacts on the practice?

In the short term, the concerns are mainly about low air quality and heat, which could affect the health of spectators, sports workers and athletes, as well as their performance. Some sports associations such as Major League Soccer (MLS) or Alberta Soccer in Canada have already established safety thresholds to regulate holding events during hot weather events and pollution peaks.

Since it is estimated that these conditions will become more frequent in the near future (the mercury is expected to exceed 30°C on more than 50 days per year in several Canadian cities, including Montreal and Toronto, by 2050-2080), it is possible to estimate a greater number of postponements and cancellations of practices and games. There is also the potential impact of fires on infrastructure and the deterioration of natural grass fields due to drought and summer watering restrictions. These fields could also be affected by increasingly harsh winter conditions.

A 2013 study in England already reported a loss of three to 13 weeks of use of some natural pitches due to more intense rainfall. In the longer term, rising oceans and more frequent flooding are likely to pose a temporary or permanent threat to clubs’ operations, jeopardizing the future of soccer in some parts of the world if greenhouse gas emissions follow their current trend.

According to a report based on modelling, by 2016 the stadiums of 23 professional teams in England could face partial or total flooding in every season. Such events have already occurred in Montpellier, France (2014) and Carlisle, England (2015), rendering the grounds unusable for several months.

In some contexts, synthetic fields offer an interesting alternative when a natural field is unavailable or too degraded; moreover, they can be used over a longer period of the year. However, data show that these fields are prone to create heat islands, with a surface temperature that can be 12°C to 22°C higher than the temperature of a natural grass. This level of temperature increases the heat stress experienced by athletes and, therefore, augments risks to their health and performance. The same is true for the health of referees, coaches and audience members.

Impacts on player health and performance

Air pollution negatively impacts the quantity and quality of passes, distance travelled and high intensity efforts of professional players. Peak pollution could even drastically reduce the number of goals scored during games.

There is empirical evidence observed for several decades that the chances of winning are higher when playing at home. In a polluted city, this increase is accentuated when the opposing team comes from a less polluted city. Why? Because the host team is used to a higher average air pollution, and therefore its performance is less affected.

Heat and dehydration can also affect the performance of the athletes and, consequently, the quality of the games and the show offered. Yet, analyses of the 2014 World Cup matches in Brazil suggest that the quality of play was not affected by the oppressive heat. However, these results should be interpreted cautiously, as elite athletes generally tolerate heat and dehydration better than untrained individuals.

So, it is possible that amateur athletes, or older players with specific health conditions will experience more adverse health and effects on their performance.

Urgent need for change: From reactive to proactive

With its scale and ability to reach a wide audience, soccer can play a major role in the current ecological transition, including through climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies.

The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) was one of the first international sports federations to commit to the United Nations Sports for Climate Action Framework, by developing its own climate strategy. Concretely, FIFA has established several initiatives that revolve around three main objectives: 1) making soccer ready for climate action; 2) protecting iconic tournaments from the negative impacts of climate change; and 3) ensuring the development of resilient soccer.

In the wake of this, in order to mitigate the impacts of climate change on its operations, the soccer world will very quickly have to move from a reactive to a proactive approach, by putting actions in place:

Banning fossil fuel sponsors;

Reorganizing competitions to reduce travel for athletes and fans by requiring national professional leagues to recommend train travel for short trips;

Encouraging public or shared transportation for fans and amateur athletes;

Reducing the vulnerability of players and spectators by adapting regulations and activities: More frequent training breaks, possibility of making more changes during games, revision of the rules concerning the duration of games in case of a tie, moving games to cooler times of the day.

Since soccer is not the only sport that is both a victim of, and an actor in climate change, urgent action by the sporting community as a whole is needed to continue to play safely and enjoyably."

0ee1e2f6-b33e-4409-a60e-98f16ea8433f,"The team at Aberystwyth University estimated the situation could result in more than a 100,000 tonnes of microbes, such as bacteria, being released into the environment over the next 80 years - a number comparable to all the cells in every human body on earth."
08fd47b6-61c0-46ec-abe3-ebb91290321e,"Fast-melting glaciers are releasing staggering amounts of bacteria into rivers and streams, which could transform icy ecosystems, scientists warn.

In a study of glacial runoff from 10 sites across the Northern Hemisphere, researchers have estimated that continued global warming over the next 80 years could release hundreds of thousands of tonnes of bacteria into environments downstream of receding glaciers.

""We think of glaciers as a huge store of frozen water but the key lesson from this research is that they are also ecosystems in their own right,"" microbiologist and study author Arwyn Edwards of Aberystwyth University in the UK told the BBC.

Glaciers are masses of ice creeping ever so slowly toward the sea, carving out mountainous valleys as they go. Yet there is more to the flows than frozen water, with minerals, gases, and organic materials trapped on a one-way slide that could take tens of thousands to millions of years to terminate.

Studying the contents of glaciers is like opening the door to another time in history. Microbes entombed inside them could be a rich source of useful, new compounds, such as antibiotics. However, the researchers behind this new study say melting glaciers are releasing tonnes upon tonnes of bacteria faster than scientists can possibly catalog them.

Led by glacial hydrologist Ian Stevens of Aarhus University in Denmark, the team sampled surface meltwater from ten glaciers across the Northern Hemisphere: in the European Alps, Greenland, Svalbard, and the far reaches of the Canadian Arctic.

Finding on average tens of thousands of microbes in each milliliter of water, they estimate that more than a hundred thousand tonnes of bacteria could be expelled into glacial meltwaters over the next 80 years, not including the glaciers in the Himalaya Hindu Kush region of Asia.

That's equivalent to 650,000 tonnes of carbon released per year into rivers, lakes, fjords, and oceans across the Northern Hemisphere, though it depends on how fast glaciers melt and how fast we curb emissions.

Under a 'middle of the road' emissions scenario – that would still see global temperatures rise between 2 and 3 °C – masses of bacteria in meltwater are predicted to peak within decades before declining or potentially disappearing entirely as glaciers recede, the researchers found.

""The number of microbes released depends closely on how quickly the glaciers melt, and therefore how much we continue to warm the planet. But the mass of microbes released is vast even with moderate warming,"" Edwards said.

Earlier this year, scientists realized that Arctic ice is already thinning faster than expected. Other research suggests that some glaciers have already passed a tipping point where meltwater is slowing to a trickle as glacial runoff steadily declines.

Microbes in meltwater can fertilize downstream ecosystems, but these may be sensitive environments or catchments used by communities that depend on glacial runoff as a water source.

The researchers didn't study individual strains of bacteria, only estimated their combined biomass, so they could not identify any species that might pose a threat to human health – nor did they determine whether microbes were active, dormant, damaged, or dead.

""The risk is probably very small, but it requires careful assessment,"" Edwards told Steffan Messenger at the BBC.

Without further studies, we also don't know how the sudden influx of microbes could contribute to further environmental change. Researchers expect it could have a profound effect on the productivity and biodiversity of microbial communities, as well as biogeochemical cycles.

On top of that, bacteria and algae found in icy environments usually contain pigments to shield themselves from damaging sunlight. But these pigments, in absorbing solar energy, could add to warming that is already accelerating glacial ice loss.

Although more research is needed to assess the downstream effects of glacial meltwater laden with microbes, these warnings shouldn't be taken lightly. Humans' thirst for water and unabated industrial activity has reshaped the global water cycle in ways we're only just beginning to comprehend.

""Over the coming decades, the forecast 'peak water' from Earth's mountain glaciers means we need to improve our understanding of the state and fate of ecosystems on the surface of glaciers,"" says glaciologist and study author Tristram Irvine-Fynn at Aberystwyth University.

""With a better grasp of that picture, we could better predict the effects of climate change on glacial surfaces and catchment biogeochemistry.""

These estimates have generally been reported in the literature and in the media, but they are 'significant underestimations', even though they're based on 'state-of-the-art' computer models, the authors say. Temperatures are warming faster in the Arctic than the rest of the world largely because of the loss of sea ice. When bright and reflective ice melts, it gives way to a darker ocean. This amplifies warming because the ocean surface absorbs more heat from the sun than the surface of snow and ice.

In their study, the researchers examined surface meltwaters from eight glaciers across Europe and North America, and two sites in western Greenland.

Using a climate model, the researchers estimated what the impact of a moderate rise in carbon emissions would be.

Their results revealed that more than 100,000 tonnes of microbes could be released from the glaciers and enter the wider environment.

For context, that's the equivalent to an average of 0.65 million tonnes per year of microbes entering rivers, lakes, fjords and oceans across the northern hemisphere over the next 80 years.

Dr Tristram Irvine-Fynn from Aberystwyth University said: 'Melting glacier ice surfaces host active microbial communities that contribute to melting and biogeochemical cycling, and nourish downstream ecosystems; but these communities remain poorly understood.

'Over the coming decades, the forecast 'peak water' from Earth's mountain glaciers means we need to improve our understanding of the state and fate of ecosystems on the surface of glaciers.

'With a better grasp of that picture, we could better predict the effects of climate change on glacial surfaces and catchment biogeochemistry.'

Worryingly, the researchers say the impact of further glacial melting may be 'significant'.

'These important findings build on much of our previous research here in Aberystwyth,' Dr Arwyn Edwards from Aberystwyth University added.

'The number of microbes released depends closely on how quickly the glaciers melt, and therefore how much we continue to warm the planet.

'But the mass of microbes released is vast even with moderate warming.

A team of researchers affiliated with multiple institutions across Europe, the U.K. and Canada has found that hundreds of thousands of tons of bacteria are currently being released annually into the environment by melting glaciers in the northern latitudes. In their paper published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment, the group describes sampling glacial runoff from multiple sites in Europe, North America and Greenland.

As climate change progresses, doomsday reports from around the world have proliferated. One alarming claim is that a virus or strain of bacteria will emerge from ancient ice that is impervious to the human immune system, killing off most, if not all, of humankind. In this new effort, the researchers have joined a growing effort to take samples of melting runoff from glaciers to learn more about their microbial ecosystems as a means to discover whether a threat exists, and if so, what sort.

The work involved collecting glacier runoff samples from eight glaciers in North America and Europe, and two from the Greenland ice cap. They studied the samples to learn more about the microbiota hosted in the runoff. They found tens of thousands of microbes in just millimeters of water and made estimates for the number of bacteria and algae that are currently being released from glaciers across the Northern Hemisphere—approximately 650,000 metric tons each year. They note that this is expected to continue for approximately 80 years, at which point, the glaciers will be gone.

The researchers did not study the bacteria individually, and thus did not spot any species that might pose a threat to human health. They did note that most of the bacteria were killed by the sun soon after exposure, suggesting that even if a human pathogen is among them, the chance of infection is slight. Bacteria in water samples, the researchers note, tend to have pigments that absorb sunlight, which further adds to warming in northern regions.

The microbes being washed downstream could fertilise ecosystems, the researchers said, but needed to be much better studied to identify any potential pathogens.

The scientists said the rapid melting of the ice by the climate crisis meant the glaciers and the unique microbial ecosystems they harboured were “dying before our eyes”, leaving researchers racing to understand them before they disappeared.

Some of the microbes may also be a future source of useful biological molecules, such as new antibiotics.

The scientists collected surface meltwaters from eight glaciers across Europe and North America and from two sites on the Greenland ice cap. They found tens of thousands of microbes in each millilitre of water.

The data enabled them to estimate the bacteria and algae being flushed out would deliver an average of 650,000 tonnes of carbon a year for the next 80 years in the northern hemisphere, excluding the Himalaya Hindu Kush region, which was not sampled. This estimate assumes a continued modest rise in CO 2 emissions. If carbon emissions are cut, slowing global heating and ice melting, the mass of microbes released would be reduced by about a third.

“We are seeing the glaciers die before our eyes, affecting the microbes that are there, with implications for us locally and globally,” said Dr Arwyn Edwards, at Aberystwyth University in Wales, and part of the study team. “The mass of microbes released is vast even with moderate warming.”

“We don’t have enough data to understand the value and the threat of these organisms. I routinely get inquiries about whether there is going to be a doomsday pathogen melting out of the glaciers. I think that’s a very minor risk, but it’s not a zero risk, so we need risk assessment of these microbes.”

Until recently, very little was known about the many thousands of microbial species inhabiting the surface of ice. Almost 1,000 new species were revealed in Tibetan glaciers in June. A consortium of researchers, the Vanishing Glaciers Project (VGP), is conducting expeditions around the world to collect samples and assess this biodiversity.

Prof Tom Battin, at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne and part of VGP, said people should not be concerned about pathogens emerging from the ice. He also said most of the ice microbes did not seem to persist downstream.

Other recent research on viruses in Lake Hazen in Canada, the largest high Arctic freshwater lake in the world, suggested that the risk of viruses spilling over to new hosts was higher at locations close to where large amounts of glacial meltwater flowed in.

The new research, published in the Communications Earth and Environment journal, used surface meltwater samples from four glaciers in the European Alps, as well as glaciers in Canada, Sweden, Svalbard, and the western Greenland ice sheet.

The study found that hundreds of thousands of tonnes of microbes would be released every year in all future scenarios for global heating. The bacteria and algae usually contain pigments to protect themselves from damage from sunlight. But these dark pigments absorb sunlight, adding to warming and speeding up the destruction of their icy habitat."

SHARM EL SHEIKH, Egypt—A deal was struck at United Nations climate talks on Saturday to set up a fund that would pay for climate-related damage in countries deemed particularly vulnerable, officials said, handing a victory to poorer nations that have pushed for the move for years and removing a major sticking point in broader negotiations to address global warming.

The fund would earmark money for what is known as loss and damage: When rising seas, more powerful storms and other effects that scientists link to climate change cause destruction that is sudden or potentially irreparable.

Negotiators representing developed and developing countries agreed to the measure in the final hours of the COP27 U.N. climate summit held in this Egyptian seaside resort. Officials cautioned that the deal on loss and damage was part of a broader agreement that is still under negotiation. Wealthy nations want stronger commitments from developing countries to cut emissions in the coming decade in hopes of meeting the climate targets of the Paris accord. Those call for governments to limit temperature increases to well under 2 degrees Celsius and preferably 1.5 degrees compared with the preindustrial era.

The fund would be targeted toward poorer countries deemed most vulnerable, delegates said, a key demand from wealthy nations that didn’t want money flowing to China and other higher-income countries that are deemed to be developing under the U.N. climate treaty. As part of the process for creating the fund, countries would identify new sources of financing, officials said. Wealthy countries want China, oil-rich Persian Gulf states and other higher-income countries in the developing world to contribute.

Small island countries and low-lying nations such as Bangladesh have for decades sought money to pay for loss and damage. Wealthy countries, which are responsible for most of the greenhouse-gas emissions that have caused the earth to warm, have long resisted, fearing that agreeing to make payments would leave their governments and companies at risk of lawsuits.

A senior Biden administration official said Saturday’s deal wouldn’t create legal liability.

Heading into the talks, the U.S., Europe and other rich nations said that a new fund wasn’t necessary and that money for loss and damage can flow through existing institutions that provide climate finance for the developing world.

A host of questions remain about how the fund will operate and whether it can act quickly to help countries that most scientists say have been affected by climate change. How much any one event can be attributed to global warming isn’t clear-cut. Some climate scientists are now weighing in on how much climate change affects the likelihood of a specific event occurring, as part of the emerging field of weather-attribution research. Climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of droughts, heat waves and other extreme weather events in many regions of the world, according to the U.N.’s latest climate-science report.

A transitional committee is expected to work out details over the next year, including how the fund fits with billions of climate financing that wealthy nationals are already providing, said Vicente Paolo Yu, a Filipino lawyer and lead negotiator for developing countries.

“What we wanted to get out of this COP was a political decision to have a fund funded by developed countries,” he said.

The U.S., as the largest emitter of greenhouse gases over time, is expected to lead efforts to provide climate finance for the developing world. But any funds would need to be approved by the U.S. Congress, where the efforts are likely to face Republican opposition.

Still, negotiators see the agreement as a welcome turn of events. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine roiled energy markets and sowed geopolitical tensions in the run-up to the talks. The world’s two biggest emitters, China and the U.S., weren’t even on speaking terms coming into the conference due to disputes over Taiwan.

U.S. climate envoy John Kerry managed to rekindle ties with his Chinese counterpart during the conference.

Then a rash of Covid-19 infections hit the summit. Mr. Kerry tested positive for the virus, his spokeswoman said, forcing him to isolate and work by phone with his team and negotiators from other countries. His spokeswoman said his symptoms were mild.

A breakthrough in the talks came on Thursday evening when the European Union said it was willing to create the fund, but on the condition that it target the most vulnerable developing nations and that wealthier developing countries contribute.

Egyptian officials on Saturday called a meeting of negotiators from the Group of 77—which represents 132 developing countries—the EU, the U.S., and the Alliance of Small Island States, or AOSIS. The Group of 77 negotiators insisted on a proposal for a loss-and-damage fund that would potentially provide money to all developing nations, even wealthier ones like China, not just the most vulnerable countries that are members of AOSIS.

European negotiators asked whether that was the position of AOSIS, whose members are also members of the Group of 77. The Maldives’ environment minister, representing AOSIS, asked for a 30 minute break to discuss the issue with the Group of 77.

Negotiators from the two groups returned to the room saying they were willing to support a fund that would be targeted to particularly vulnerable countries as the EU wanted.

In recent years, the demand for a separate fund became a rallying cry for poorer countries seen as most vulnerable to climate change. Many developing countries have pointed to the scale of monsoon rains and floods in Pakistan this year, which have left the country with losses and rebuilding costs assessed by the government and World Bank at $30 billion, as an example of what vulnerable countries could increasingly contend with. Less than half of Pakistan’s $816 million international emergency appeal has been funded.

c87f168d-b381-44f0-9a04-2a5fee59bc7b,"Crucial climate talks in Egypt to run past deadline as key issues including funds to help victim nations remain pending.

Global climate talks have entered the final scheduled day of negotiations as chances of a deal still look unclear.

The United Nations’ Climate Change Conference (COP27) in Egypt was expected to go past its deadline on Friday and into the weekend, with rich and developing nations deadlocked over creating a fund for countries devastated by the effects of global warming.

The Egyptian presidency on Friday morning released a new, slimmer draft for an overarching cover document after a 20-page version released a day earlier had been criticised for being too long, vague and confusing.

Among some of the most pressing topics was the European Union’s proposal to tie compensation for climate disasters to tougher emissions cuts, two of the thorniest issues at the meeting.

The two-pronged approach from the 27-nation EU would create a pot of money for poor countries and push for steeper cuts of heat-trapping emissions by all countries, as well as the phasing out of all fossil fuels, including natural gas and oil.

EU climate chief Frans Timmermans said the bloc’s proposal on funding for loss and damage and mitigation was “a final offer” that sought to “find a compromise” between countries.

In climate negotiations, loss and damage refers to the idea that rich nations, which have historically done the most to contribute to climate change, should compensate the developing countries most affected.

Mitigation refers to efforts to slow global warming, like drastically reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.

Timmermans said he was “encouraged” by the immediate reaction to the proposal and more engagement was expected on Friday.

“This is about not having a failure here,” he said. “We we cannot afford to have a failure. Now, if our steps forward are not reciprocated, then obviously there will be a failure. But I hope we can avoid that.”

‘No money in the world’

Germany’s foreign minister said the European Union is serious about delivering climate justice for poor countries suffering disastrous effects of global warming, urging other major polluters to put up or shut up when it comes to providing financial support for those in need.

“We’re making clear that Europe is on the side of the most vulnerable states,” German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said. “Others can now show which side they are on. Spending money is not an end in itself, but it is about ensuring justice.”

Baerbock acknowledged that industrialised countries who were “mainly responsible for global warming up to now should also pay for the damage and losses as a matter of priority”.

But she warned excluding key polluters and not also requiring them to cut their emissions would “be a totally wrong incentive system”.

Baerbock added unless emissions are reduced more steeply, “no money in the world could pay for the damages and losses of the future”.

‘Deafening silence’

Other big players were staking out their positions after the EU’s offer. Deals at COP27 must be made with support from all of the nearly 200 countries at the talks.

China, which had been quiet during much of the talks, and Saudi Arabia both said the money for a loss and damage fund should not come from them. Developed countries should foot the bill, China said.

Both also insisted the 2015 Paris Agreement that aims to limit global warming to an ambitious 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) increase should not be altered.

As for the United States, there was “a deafening silence” after the EU revealed their proposal, said Preety Bhandari, a senior adviser on climate finance at the World Resources Institute.

“So I assume overnight and during the course of the day there will be a lot of diplomatic outreach across various parties to finally help us land the decision on funding for loss and damage here at COP27.”

‘Shying away’

Loss and damage has become a flashpoint at the climate talks that started two weeks ago. Poorer countries bearing the brunt of climate change, from rising sea levels to extreme flooding, have been stepping up the urgency, accusing richer polluters that have contributed the most to Earth-warming greenhouse gas emissions of stalling.

Hours before the EU’s intervention, COP27 President Sameh Shoukry – the foreign minister of host country Egypt – had told reporters that countries were “shying away from taking the difficult political decisions”.

The UN climate agency also published a draft proposal for a loss and damage deal late on Thursday, but the three options laid out for delegates to consider did not yet reflect the EU proposal.

The first option suggests establishing a new fund for climate-vulnerable countries. The second posits delaying the decision on a fund until next year’s COP28 summit. The third calls for deciding on funding arrangements at COP28, with no mention of a new fund.

Climate-vulnerable countries insist that they cannot wait another year for the creation of a fund to pay compensation."

BERLIN (Reuters) - Countries like China should contribute more to compensation payments for countries hit by climate-fuelled disasters, German Development Minister Svenja Schulze told broadcaster Bayerischer Rundfunk on Friday.

""China has 28 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions at the moment. So they must also contribute to dealing with the damage,"" Schulze told Bayerischer Rundfunk in an interview.

""They always hide behind the fact that they are a developing country. But de facto they are no longer a developing country.""

Climate negotiators on Friday were mulling a late-night European Union proposal aimed at resolving a stubborn impasse over financing for countries hit by climate-fuelled disasters and pushing this year's U.N. climate summit in Egypt closer to a final deal.

The EU proposal would be to set up a special fund for covering loss and damage in the most vulnerable countries - but funded from a ""broad donor base"".

The EU offer is at odds with a proposal by developing countries and China that called for all developing countries to have access to the fund. That proposal used a U.N. definition that would have allowed China to receive, not contribute, money.

Negotiations on mandatory compensation payments in Sharm el-Sheikh were ongoing, Schulze said, ""and I also do not believe that this can be concluded today, but that we still need an extension"".

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt (AP) — John Kerry, the top U.S. envoy at this year's U.N. climate talks in Egypt, has tested positive for COVID-19, a spokesperson said late Friday night, another potential setback for negotiations that were already going into overtime with no result in sight.

""He is fully vaccinated and boosted and experiencing mild symptoms. He is working with his negotiations team and foreign counterparts by phone to ensure a successful outcome of COP27,” spokesperson Whitney Smith wrote in a statement late Friday.

Kerry's illness was sure to add to worries about the negotiations, which had been scheduled to end Friday. A former U.S. senator and secretary of state, Kerry has deep relationships with leaders around the world and carries a lot of weight in international talks. His meetings in Sharm el-Sheikh with China's climate envoy Xie Zhenhua were closely watched for signs that the world's two biggest polluters might agree a deal that would boost the overall talks.

Negotiations, at least those in public, hit a lull Friday afternoon as news conferences and plenaries were postponed or cancelled. Diplomats said they hoped for late night progress and changed airline reservations so talks could continue.

Delegates said there was some headway being made, especially on the most difficult sticking point. That's the issue of rich industrialized nations providing money to vulnerable countries suffering from ‘loss and damage’ as a result of climate-related disasters.

“I think we’re in for a bit of a long haul,” World Resources Institute international climate director David Waskow said. “Loss and damage sits at the center in terms of what needs to be done to get this over the finish line.”

The United States appeared isolated in opposing a dedicated loss and damage fund after the European Union produced a surprise offer on the issue Thursday. But a State Department official confirmed that negotiations on the issue were ongoing.

A group of developing nations known as G-77 and China have insisted on a fund being established at the meeting and remained outwardly united on the issue late Friday.

Other delegates at the talks expressed hope that a deal might still be possible.

“We are very busy and they’re making some progress and they’ve gotten some clarity on all positions,” Molwyn Joseph, who spoke on behalf of small island states, told The Associated Press.

“There is the possibility that we could get an outcome, but also it could fall over at the last minute,"" said New Zealand’s Climate Change Minister James Shaw. ""And I think if that happened, it would be a real shame because this is as close (on loss and damage) as we’ve ever been before.""

Climate activist Nakeeyat Dramani Sam of Ghana chided delegates at this year's U.N. climate talks, saying they would act faster to rein in global warming if they were her age.

“It is an emergency,” the 10-year-old told negotiators, holding a sign that read “Payment Overdue”. “If all of you were to be young people like me, wouldn’t you have already agreed to do what is needed to save our planet?""

But after receiving a standing ovation, it was back to nations squabbling over several thorny issues, with the Egyptian presidency acknowledging that the talks will go into overtime on Saturday, if not longer.

“Time is not on our side,” said Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry. Speaking as the summit's chair, he pledged to try to find common ground going forward. “The global community is looking to us to be bold and ambitious.”

The EU proposal on ‘loss and damage’ payments Thursday would require emerging economies such as China — the second biggest historic polluter after the U.S. — to contribute to the fund.

“We’re making clear that Europe is on the side of the most vulnerable states,” German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said. “Others can now show which side they are on.”

The EU proposal would also require stepped up efforts on reducing, or ‘mitigating,’ greenhouse gas emissions to slow global warming. It also adopts a call to phase down all fossil fuels — a measure first proposed by India and a dramatic step up from previous commitments to just phase down coal.

Unless emissions are cut more steeply, “no money in the world could pay for the damages and losses of the future,” Baerbock said.

EU climate chief Frans Timmermans said Friday that the bloc’s proposal on funding for loss and damage and mitigation is “a final offer” that seeks to “find a compromise” between countries as negotiators work out a way forward.

The environmental advocacy group Action Aid called the proposal a “wolf in sheep’s clothing” because it doesn’t go far enough.

The EU plan was a counter to a proposal made by the Group of 77 and China, which would create a fund but only require developed nations to contribute, excepting top polluters China and India.

China, which had been quiet during much of the talks, and Saudi Arabia both said the money for a loss and damage fund shouldn't come from them. Developed countries should foot the bill, China said. Both also insisted that the 2015 Paris Agreement that aims to limit global warming to an ambitious 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) increase should not be altered, which can be interpreted as not strengthening efforts.

A senior official from the Maldives voiced growing frustration at the way vulnerable countries keep getting caught up in battles between more powerful nations at the talks, even as their situation gets increasingly dire due to climate change.

“Small island states have just 86 months and we’re already feeling it,” the official said, referring to scientists’ calculations that greenhouse gas emissions have to be halved by 2030. “We can’t be sandwiched between global powers.”

Friday’s draft of the overarching decision on the outcome of the talks, issued by the Egyptian presidency, includes some vague references to reform to multilateral development banks but did not include or make reference to the detailed Bridgetown Initiative on financial reform from Barbados and its Prime Minister Mia Mottley.

MILAN, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Climate-change protesters threw flour on Friday over a sports car painted by the U.S. pop artist Andy Warhol that is on display in Italy's financial capital.

It was at the third time this month that activists from the group Ultima Generazione (Last Generation) have targeted art exhibitions.

On Nov. 4, protesters hurled soup over a Van Gogh work in Rome and on Nov. 15, they threw a black liquid on a Gustav Klimt painting in Vienna. Both masterpieces were protected by glass screens and unharmed.

The BMW Art Car looked as if it had been covered by a dusting of snow after Friday's attack.

Warhol painted it in 1979, the same year as it took part in the 24-hour race at Le Mans in France, before being taken off the road and placed in a museum.

Ultima Generazione's high-profile stunts to push for tougher action to tackle global warming have coincided with climate talks in Egypt.

Chaos erupted in Milan’s Fabbrica del Vapore art centre on Friday when a group of environmental activists threw eight kilograms of flour over Andy Warhol‘s BMW M1 Art Car in yet another display of climate change protest.

The Italian news agency Ansa reported that the group of rowdy protesters also glued themselves to the car, while others smashed paint-filled balloons on the floor.

The protesters belong to Ultima Generazione (Last Generation), a self-proclaimed “Italian civil disobedience campaign.” On its website, the group calls for the Italian government to halt the reopening of disused coal plants, cancel new natural gas extraction projects and prioritize renewable energy.

This was the third time this month that activists from the group Ultima Generazione have targeted art exhibitions.

On Nov. 4, protesters hurled pea soup over a Vincent van Gogh work in Rome. On Nov. 15, they threw a black liquid on a Gustav Klimt painting in Vienna. Both masterpieces were protected by glass screens and were unharmed.

Friday’s protesters shouted to spectators in the gallery as they emptied the bags of flour over the car.

The Fabbrica del Vapore art centre has not yet disclosed whether any damage occurred to the painted vehicle, but it was certainly covered almost entirely in flour.

Others in the room attempted to restrain the activists, though it remains unclear if they are Ultima Generazione members, art centre guests or security employed by Fabbrica del Vapore. They dragged several protesters across the flour-covered floor as they continued to shout.

Environmental activists have spilled orange paint on the 'Horse and Rider' statue, by American artist Charles Ray, on display in the streets of France's capital, Paris.

This act is part of an apparent campaign by climate organizations to attack well-known works of art to denounce climate change and government inaction.

The activists, members of the group Last Renewal, has also put a white T-shirt on the rider of the statue on which could be read the slogan 'We have 858 days left', in a clear reference to the period available to avoid a climate catastrophe.

""Climate conferences are not going to save us, everyone knows that. Civil resistance is our only hope (...) Please act, react"", has moved from the Last Renewal movement.

For her part, the French Minister of Culture, Rima Abdul Malak, denounced that ""environmentalist vandalism has gone up a notch"" after the attack on Ray's sculpture. ""Thanks to the restorers, who intervened quickly,"" she said on Twitter.

Charles Ray is one of the most prominent American sculptors and, since the beginning of the year, his statue has stood in front of the Pinault Museum, in the former Mercantile Exchange in the center of the French capital.

Environmental activists have carried out similar actions in museums around the world in recent months, including in Madrid, where the paintings of 'La maja desnuda' and 'La maja vestida', works by Francisco de Goya, were attacked.

According to Italian newspaper La Repubblica, the art gallery was forced to close after the stunt, and that the police were working to identify the activists behind it.

Stefano Lacagnina, the producer of the exhibition, told the newspaper that the protesters 'paid for the ticket and had the bags of flour in their pockets. They completely sprinkled the machine with flour. It is an important piece, which was exhibited for the first time in the exhibition and has a great value.'

He added: 'Now we have to figure out what to do'.

Last Generation wrote in a statement: 'Works of art have been targeted in order to highlight the hypocrisy of our society's values: do we really get outraged at the simulation of damage to works of art while the ongoing objective destruction of works of nature, ecosystems and our own lives leaves us indifferent?'

Friday's stunt in Milan's financial district was at the third time this week activists from the group have targeted art exhibitions, with Gustav Klimt's masterpiece 'Death and Life' being targeted in Vienna on Wednesday.

The BMW M1 car took part in the 24-Hours Le Mans race in 1977 - finishing sixth - before the famous visual artist, film director, and producer painted it with a pattern of bold colours. It is said to be worth more than £50 million.

MailOnline has contacted Fabbrica del Vapore for comment.

Ultima Generazione says its high-profile stunts push for tougher action to tackle global warming have coincided with climate talks in Egypt. The COP27 climate change conference is scheduled to finish on Friday, but it is expected to run into overtime as delegates from nearly 200 countries struggle to agree on a way forward.

Numerous masterpieces and artwork across Europe have been attacked in recent weeks in protests at the perceived lack of action against climate change.

The incident came after the headquarters of Italy's state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) were sprayed in orange by the same group on Wednesday.

Paint was sprayed around the main entrance of the building, after which a handful of the activists glued their hands to the outside walls. They were forcibly removed by police.

CDP was targeted because it invests 'billions' in fossil fuel projects around the world, Ultima Generazione said in a statement. Two weeks ago, members of the same group threw pea soup at a Vincent Van Gogh painting that was loaned by a Dutch museum for an exhibition in Rome.

Also on Wednesday, the group poured a black, oily liquid over Austrian painter Gustav Klimt's masterpiece 'Death and Life' at Vienna's Leopold Museum.

Two members of the Last Generation group threw the dye over the 1915 painting before one proceeded to glue himself to the glass protecting the masterpiece.

A security guard at the museum managed to restrain one of the activists before police arrived at the site.

Museum staff were concerned that Klimt's painting could have been damaged in the protest.

'Restorers are working to determine whether the painting protected by glass has been damaged,' the museum's spokesman Klaus Pokorny said.

The 'Last Generation' group defended the protest, saying in a tweet that they were protesting 'oil and gas drilling,' which they called 'a death sentence to society.'

The group called for a reduction in speed limits across the Austrian road network which they claim would save 460 million tonnes of CO2 per year.

The organisation said they targeted the exhibition because it was sponsored by the Austrian oil industry, who paid to allow free access to the museum.

The eco activists said on Twitter: 'There can be no clean art with dirty money involved!'

Who was Gustav Klimt? Gustav Klimt was an Austrian painter best known for his decorative, erotic paintings of the female body. His most famous works, The Kiss and Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, were painted between 1907 and 1908. Gustav was born in Vienna in 1862 and at the age of 14, he was awarded a scholarship to the Vienna School of Arts and Crafts. Gustav later excelled in the artworld and opened an art studio with his brother Ernst Klimt. The artist's work was marked by erotic paintings of the female body, making him the subject of controversy in a conservative society. Klimt began painting his final masterpiece 'The Bride' in 1917, months before he suffered a stroke at the age of 55. He died a year later.

In footage shared by the group on social media two men can be seen pouring a black, oily liquid on the famous Klimt painting.

One of the activists can be heard shouting that 'we have known about the problem for 50 years - we must finally act, otherwise the planet will be broken.'

'Stop the fossil fuel destruction. We are racing into a climate hell,' he added.

After the attack, police arrived at the museum and the black liquid was quickly cleaned off the glass protecting the painting, Austria Press Agency reported.

Despite thorough controls at the Leopold Museum's entrance, the activists succeeded in bringing the liquid inside by hiding it in a hot water bottle under their clothes, the agency reported.

Admission to the Leopold Museum was free on Tuesday as part of a day sponsored by the Austrian oil and gas group OMV.

The Klimt work is an oil on canvas painting in the Art Nouveau style depicting death on the left side and a group of partially naked, hugging people on the right side.

It's one of the latest pieces of art to be targeted by climate activists to draw attention to global warming.

Different activist groups have staged numerous demonstrations in recent months, including blocking streets and throwing mashed potatoes at a Claude Monet painting in Germany.

The British group Just Stop Oil threw tomato soup at Vincent van Gogh's 'Sunflowers' in London's National Gallery last month.

Just Stop Oil activists also glued themselves to the frame of an early copy of Leonardo da Vinci's 'The Last Supper' at London's Royal Academy of Arts, and to John Constable's 'The Hay Wain' in the National Gallery.

A group of activists also threw pea soup onto a Vincent van Gogh masterpiece in Rome, in a protest they warned will continue until more attention was paid to climate change.

'The Sower', an 1888 painting by the Dutch artist depicting a farmer sowing his land under a dominating sun, was exhibited behind glass and undamaged.

Security intervened immediately and removed the protesters kneeling in front of 'The Sower' at the Palazzo Bonaparte. Protesters from the same group, the Last Generation, earlier blocked a highway near Rome.

The climate activists from Last Generation called their protest 'a desperate and scientifically grounded cry that cannot be understood as mere vandalism'.

'Non-violent direct actions will continue until citizens get answers from their government on the demands to stop gas and coal and to invest in at least 20 GW of renewables,' they said in a statement.

In a separate protest, two female activists glued themselves to the frames of two paintings by Spanish artist Francisco de Goya at Madrid's Prado Museum.

The pair scrawled the message +1.5 degrees Celsius between the paintings they targeted - the Naked Maja and the Clothed Maja - a reference to the damaging differences to the planet which will be seen at two degrees as opposed to 1.5.

In the wake of the protests, dozens of the world's top museums issued a joint declaration last week saying environmental activists who attack paintings 'severely underestimate' the damage that could be caused.

The statement was spearheaded by the Prado in Madrid, and signed by the directors of more than 90 world-renowned museums including the Guggenheim in New York, Louvre in Paris and Uffizi in Florence.

Earlier this month, climate change activists blocked aircraft from leaving Amsterdam for hours by sitting in front of the wheels.

Environmental activists wearing white overalls stormed an area holding private jets at Schiphol Airport, located southwest of the capital, before military police moved in and were seen taking dozens of the protesters away in buses.

More than 100 activists were arrested, national broadcaster NOS said, but no delays to commercial flights were reported.

The protest was part of a day of demonstrations in and around the air hub organised by Greenpeace and Extinction Rebellion in the build-up to the COP27 climate talks in Egypt.

Earlier this month, eco protesters sat down in the motorway in Rome and blocked drivers from getting to work.

Italian police officers were called to the scene and dragged the eco-protesters off the motorway after they brought travel chaos to Rome.

Just days earlier, protesters sat in the middle of the Via Guglielmo Marcon in Rome holding banners aloft as part of Ultima Generazione, Italian for Last Generation, demonstrations.

The 'civil disobedience' movement was borne from Extinction Rebellion and the independent 'Ultima Generazioneâ' last year.

The protesters are demanding that disused coal plants be reopened and calling for a halt to a new drilling project for the research into and extraction of natural gas.

In Paris, environmental activists dumped orange paint over an outdoor sculpture by the American artist Charles Ray, the latest in a string of artwork defacements aimed at spurring greater government efforts to fight climate change.

The action was claimed by Derniere Renovation ('Last Renewal'), which showed two activists kneeling and holding hands in front of the doused sculpture on its website.

They had also put a white T-shift over the rider with the phrase 'We have 858 days left', apparently a reference to studies that say carbon emissions must peak by 2025 if the planet is to have a viable future.

'Eco-vandalism is taken up a notch,' Culture Minister Rima Abdel Malak, who visited the site as workers cleaned up the paint, wrote on Twitter.

'Art and ecology are not incompatible. It's the opposite, they are common causes,' she said.

The incident came as climate activists targeted an Andy Warhol work in Milan on Friday, covering a car repainted by the American pop artist with flour - two weeks after the same group threw pea soup at a Van Gogh painting in Rome.

Vermeer's 'Girl with a Pearl Earring' in The Hague and Van Gogh's 'Sunflowers' in London have also been targeted, drawing widespread condemnation from officials.

From hurling tomato soup at a Van Gough painting to throwing mashed potatoes at a Claude Monet masterpiece, how eco-activists are targeting famous artwork in protests

By Rachael Bunyan for MailOnline

Eco-activists are now deploying the controversial tactic of attacking famous artwork across Europe in protest against a lack of action against climate change.

The eco-zealots have glued themselves to a Francisco Goya in Madrid, poured soup over Vincent van Gogh paintings in London and Rome, and thrown mashed potatoes on a Claude Monet in recent weeks.

Today, activists threw paint all over a BMW car painted by Pop Art legend Andy Warhold, and of Wednesday, they threw a black, oily liquid over Austrian painter Gustav Klimt's 1915 masterpiece 'Death and Life' at Vienna's Leopold Museum.

The activists are hoping that by attacking famous artwork it will jolt public opinion and lead to action against climate change. But many have questioned how attacking works of art is helping their goal.

Austria's culture minister Andrea Mayer said following the attack on Klimt's painting that 'art and culture are allies in the fight against climate catastrophe, not adversaries'. 'From my point of view, accepting the risk of irrevocable damage to works of art is the wrong way to go,' Mayer added.

Hans-Peter Wipplinger, the director of the Leopold Museum, said that the concerns of the climate activists were justified, 'but attacking works of art is definitely the wrong way to implement the targeted goal of preventing the predicted climate collapse.'

Earlier this month, eco-activists threw pea soup on Vincent Van Gogh's 'The Sower' painting in Rome to protest carbon use and natural gas extraction.

Security intervened immediately and removed the protesters kneeling in front of the 1888 painting, which depicts a farmer sowing his land under a dominating sun, at the Palazzo Bonaparte to deliver a manifesto.

Italy's new culture minister, Gennaro Sangiuliano, condemned the protest at the time.

'Attacking art is an ignoble act that must be firmly condemned,' he said. 'Culture, which is the basis of our identity, must be defended and protected, and certainly not used as a megaphone for other forms of protest.'

The stunt backfired for some onlookers.

'It totally defeats the purpose,' Hans Bergetoft, a tourist from Stockholm, said. 'I am really for the cause in itself, but not the action. Not the action that they took. Not at all.'

In October, three activists from British group Just Stop Oil threw tomato soup at Vincent van Gogh's 'Sunflowers' in London's National Gallery.

The activists dumped two cans of tomato soup over the Van Gogh oil painting, one of the Dutch artist's most iconic works. The two protesters also glued themselves to the gallery wall.

The painting, one of several versions of 'Sunflowers' that Van Gogh painted in the late 1880s, was cleaned and returned to its place in the National Gallery following the protest.

Just Stop Oil has drawn attention, and criticism, for their disruptive tactics, including targeting artworks in museums.

In July, activists glued themselves to the frame of an early copy of Leonardo da Vinci's 'The Last Supper' at London's Royal Academy of Arts, and to John Constable's 'The Hay Wain' in the National Gallery.

Last month, eco activists targeted the world famous Girl with a Pearl Earring painting in the Netherlands.

Three Just Stop Oil vandals were arrested at the Mauritshuis museum in The Hague, and the Johannes Vermeer artwork is said to be undamaged after the protest which sparked groans and heckles from the unimpressed onlookers.

In July, one hero gallery worker silenced a pair of ranting eco-zealots as she warned them to 'get off our paintings and get out' at Manchester Art Gallery.

Two men from the campaign group Just Stop Oil wearing orange t-shirts with the words 'Just Stop Oil' written in black on their fronts both placed a hand on either side of the frame surrounding Thomson's Aeolian Harp, a piece from 1809 by the English Romantic painter JMW Turner.

Spray painted on the floor underneath the JMW Turner painting in Manchester read the words, 'no new oil'.

9d11cbba-e436-4b74-9b52-c89dd837d323,"A new Pew Research Center report explores how religion in the U.S. intersects with views on the environment and climate change

NEW YORK -- Most adults in the United States – including a large majority of Christians and people who identify with other religions – consider the Earth sacred and believe God gave humans a duty to care for it.

But highly religious Americans – those who pray daily, regularly attend religious services and consider religion crucial in their lives -- are far less likely than other U.S. adults to express concern about global warming.

Those are among the key findings in a comprehensive report released Thursday by the Pew Research Center, which surveyed 10,156 U.S. adults from April 11 to April 17. It’s margin of error for the full sample of respondents is plus or minus 1.6 percentage points.

The survey says religious Americans tend to be less concerned about climate change for several reasons.

“First and foremost is politics: The main driver of U.S. public opinion about the climate is political party, not religion,” the report says.

“Highly religious Americans are more inclined than others to identify with or lean toward the Republican Party, and Republicans tend to be much less likely than Democrats to believe human activity (such as burning fossil fuels) is warming the Earth or to consider climate change a serious problem.”

Responding to the findings, the Rev. Richenda Fairhurst, steward of climate at the non-profit Circle Faith Future, said the siloed culture in America sows further division instead of inspiring teamwork.

“I don't know who that serves,"" she said. ""But it's not serving the community — and it's certainly not serving the planet.”

The poll found that about three-quarters (74%) of religiously affiliated Americans say the Earth is sacred. A larger share, (80%), feel a sense of stewardship -- and fully or mostly agree with the idea that “God gave humans a duty to protect and care for the Earth, including the plants and animals.”

Religious Americans who show little or no concern about climate change also say “there are much bigger problems in the world, that God is in control of the climate, and that they do not believe the climate is actually changing.”

Many religious Americans are also concerned about the potential consequences of environmental regulations, including the loss of individual freedoms, fewer jobs or increased energy prices, the report says.

The survey also found that two-thirds of U.S. adults who are religiously affiliated say their faith’s scriptures include lessons about the environment, and about four-in-ten say they’ve prayed for the environment in the past year.

The views, the report says, are common across a range of religious traditions.

Three-quarters of both evangelical Protestants and members of historically Black Protestant churches say the Bible includes lessons about the environment. Eight in ten U.S. Catholics and mainline Protestants say the Earth is sacred and so do 77% of non-Christian religions, according to the poll.

But Christians, and more broadly, religiously affiliated Americans, are divided in their views about climate change, the report says.

Those who consider climate change “an extremely or very serious problem” range from 68% of adults who identify with the historically Black Protestant tradition, to 34% of evangelical Protestants.

In none of the major Protestant traditions did a majority say the Earth is getting warmer mostly because of human activity; only 32% of evangelicals felt that way.

The report says the religiously unaffiliated -- the fastest-growing group in surveys asking Americans about their religious identity – are much more likely to say that climate change is an extreme or very serious problem (70%) than religiously affiliated Americans (52%).

Commonly known as the “nones,” they describe themselves as atheists, agnostics or “nothing in particular.” The report says they are far more likely to say the Earth is getting warmer mostly because of human-induced activity (66%) than those who are religiously affiliated (47%).

The survey offers clues as to why religious Americans are less likely to care about climate change than those with no religion despite seeing a link between their beliefs and caring for the environment:

• For U.S. congregations, climate change doesn’t seem to be a major focus. The report says that among all U.S. adults who attend religious services at least once or twice per month, only 8% say they “hear a great deal or quite a bit about climate change in sermons.”

• One in five say they hear some discussion of the topic from the pulpit.

• And just 6% of American congregants say they talk about climate change with other people at their congregation a great deal or quite a bit.

Highly religious Americans are also less likely to view inefficient energy practices as morally wrong, the report says. This same pattern is also seen when asked about eating food that takes a lot of energy to produce.

The Rev. Fletcher Harper, an Episcopal priest, and executive director of GreenFaith, a global multi-faith environmental organization based in New York, said he was not surprised by the findings since he doesn't see culturally and politically conservative Americans prioritizing climate action.

“What this study doesn’t tell us, though, is the role that religion, when utilized effectively, can play in moving people who are concerned but inactive into public action on the climate’s behalf,” Harper said. ""This warrants further research so that we can all understand better what positive role religion can play in the fight against climate change.""

930389cb-3c31-43e4-a350-d5224bc84d93,"Religious Americans overwhelmingly believe they have a duty to protect the Earth, according to a new poll from the Pew Research Center, with 80 percent saying God entrusted them with that responsibility. The survey also found that 42 percent prayed for the environment in the past year.

But that sense of duty doesn’t necessarily mean they’re clamoring to take on climate change. Less than half of highly religious people considered the overheating planet a “very” or “extremely” serious problem, though two-thirds said it was at least “somewhat” serious. In comparison, almost three-quarters of people with low religious commitment said climate change was a very serious problem.

At more than 100 pages long, the Pew poll is one of the most in-depth surveys on the link between Americans’ religious beliefs and climate views to date, offering a deeper look into why religious people tend to be less concerned about climate than their nonreligious counterparts.

Researchers pointed to politics as the most convincing explanation. Responses to the Pew poll suggest that Americans’ views on climate change tend to be influenced more heavily by their political party than by what they hear at church.

Nationwide, about 83 percent of Democrats are likely to think of climate change as a very serious problem, compared to 25 percent of Republicans. “When you look within religious groups, you see the same pattern there, whether it’s evangelical Protestants or religiously unaffiliated Americans,” said Becka Alper, who wrote the Pew report. “Within religious groups, those who are Republican are far less likely than those who are Democrat to say climate change is a serious problem.”

When asked to explain why they believe climate change isn’t a serious problem, religiously affiliated Americans often echoed Republican talking points. According to the poll, about half said that stricter environmental laws could hurt jobs and the economy.

The finding that partisanship plays such an influential role in people’s climate views aligns with more than a decade of research, said Robin Globus Veldman, a professor of religious studies at Texas A&M University. The relationship between politics and religion can be hard to untangle, however, since the influence goes both ways.

“People really quickly go and say, ‘Oh, it’s just politics. It has nothing to do with religion. It’s just a coincidence that evangelicals tend to be more politically conservative and so that fully explains their climate attitudes,’” Veldman said. “I think there is a lot more interconnection between being evangelical and being politically conservative, and so you can’t separate it out and say, ‘All of this politics is not religion.’”

The Pew poll, which surveyed more than 10,000 Americans in April, found other reasons why those who believe they’ve been entrusted with caring for the Earth might fail to connect that with acting on climate change. More than a third of evangelicals said there are much bigger problems in the world than global warming; others said that God is in control of the climate.

Another obstacle is that most places of worship aren’t really connecting the dots. Just 8 percent of Americans who attend religious services regularly reported they hear a lot about climate change in sermons. For pastors, “it’s such a politicized issue that there’s a huge disincentive to discuss that topic,” Veldman said. “You have to do it very delicately, and you risk alienating people and driving them away from the other good things you do in your church.”

That said, there are some signs that highly religious people are taking environmental problems seriously — even among the most historically resistant group, evangelicals. In a report earlier this year, the National Association of Evangelicals, which represents 45,000 evangelical churches, called climate action a Christian responsibility and made the Biblical case to save the planet. Young evangelicals have led the push for climate action within the tradition.

More broadly, a majority of Americans of all religions thought that passing a bill to address climate change should be a priority for Congress, according to a poll from Morning Consult and Politico last year. That included 60 percent of Christians and 79 percent of Jews, Buddhists, Hindus, and Muslims. They got what they wanted, at least in theory, when President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act in August, the single largest climate package in U.S. history.

On the international level, faith groups have organized more than 40 side events at the U.N. climate conference this month in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, to offer a religious perspective on the climate crisis.

While the finding that many people are praying for the environment may be encouraging, Veldman said to take it with a grain of salt, as the religious-friendly framing of the poll could have swayed their answers. “It’s like asking if you love your mother — you know what everyone’s going to say,” she said. “Everybody believes you should protect the Earth, right? Especially when it’s in a religion framing and in a survey that’s making religious questions salient.”"

Brazil's president-elect, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has proposed that the climate summit organized annually by the UN be held in the Brazilian Amazon in 2025, in an attempt to vindicate his environmental commitments in contrast to the policies of the current president, Jair Bolsonaro.

""We are going to talk to the UN secretary general so that the next COP is held in Brazil, in the Amazon,"" Lula announced on his Twitter account, without setting a date. He did make it clear in Sharm el Sheikh (Egypt) that he aspires to host the 2025 COP, which would be the COP30, according to the news portal G1.

In this way, international delegations could get to know the ""concrete reality"" of a region usually catalogued as the lungs of the planet, according to Lula, who has traveled these days to the COP27 in Sharm el Sheikh in his first visit abroad after the elections.

Brazil had already proposed to host COP25 in 2019, but the arrival to power of Bolsonaro implied the withdrawal of the South American giant as host of a forum that was initially moved to Chile and, due to protests, finally landed in Spain.

""Brazil is back in the world"", stressed the Brazilian president-elect on his social networks, without directly alluding to his rival in the last elections, whom he has repeatedly reproached for his lack of clear policies in defense of the environment and against climate change."
16156e4b-a186-462b-b2bb-70d331b36a6e,"SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt – Brazil's President-elect, Luiz Incio Lula da Silva, returned to the world stage at the UN climate summit with a promise to reverse surging deforestation rates in the Amazon rainforest.

Lula's defeat of former President Jair Bolsonaro could mark a turning point in the fight against climate change because the Amazon sucks vast amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and stores it in trees and soil.

Under Bolsonaro, an area larger than Belgium was lost to illegal mining and logging and agriculture; before Bolsonaro took office, deforestation had mostly been on a decade-long decline. He slashed funding for environmental enforcement and halted government efforts to demarcate Indigenous' peoples lands.

""Brazil is back!"" Lula said while the audience cheered and sang ""Ol, ol ol ola"" as he took the stage. ""There is no climate security for the world without protecting the Amazon.""

He said nature is an economic ally, not an enemy ""to be knocked down by tractors and chainsaws,"" and promised to make climate the highest priority when he officially takes office in January. A ministry of native people will also be established, he said.

Lula's victory is giving Indigenous people like Dinamam Tux hope. He is executive coordinator of the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil, a group advocating for land rights and greater representation in Brazil's government.

Bolsonaro's actions legitimized an increase in violence against Indigenous peoples, Tux told Insider on the sidelines of COP27. He said Lula needs to protect communities like his in Bahia state in Brazil, as well as make Indigenous people part of the government.

""We want to make decisions for ourselves,"" Tux said. ""We don't want non-Indigenous people making decisions for us.""

Tux also attended last year's UN climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, where 145 countries including Brazil pledged to halt deforestation by 2030. For the first time, countries recognized that securing land rights for Indigenous populations would help achieve that goal and mitigate climate change.

Indigenous groups could claim rights to as much as 65% of the world's land but only 10% is recognized under national laws, according to the Rights and Resources Initiative, an advocacy organization.

A dozen wealthy nations, including the US and UK, promised to spend $12 billion over five years on the effort. The private sector promised another $7 billion. A slice of the funding was set aside for securing land rights for Indigenous people.

Fast forward to Sharm el-Sheikh, where a ""forest and climate leaders partnership"" was established to carry out the deforestation pledge. Only a fraction of the countries who signed on at Glasgow are involved. Still, nearly $2.6 billion was spent in 2021, including at least $321 million to help secure land rights for Indigenous peoples, according to progress reports.

Tux said that money didn't reach his community, and the progress reports acknowledged that there isn't enough funding flowing directly to groups representing Indigenous peoples. Most of it ended up in the hands of larger NGOs."
64e532b6-36ae-4faa-b681-27cd6ea70557,"Climate change and pollution are making troublesome neurological disease symptoms worse, according to new research in Neurology, the journal of the American Academy of Neurology.

The authors reviewed 364 studies from 1990 to 2022 on climate change, neurological disorders, temperature and pollutants to reach their conclusion. As Forbes summarized findings, “extreme weather events accelerated by climate change are associated with an increase in strokes, migraines and seizures, an increase in hospital visits among patients with dementia and worsening severity of multiple sclerosis symptoms.”

The studies all involved adult subjects, not children.

The World Health Organization has referred to climate change as “the single biggest health threat facing humanity.”

The report said extreme weather is marked by drastic temperature change, high temperatures and heat waves.

Airborne pollutants were associated with a higher chance of having stroke, headaches, dementia and Parkinson’s disease, as well as more severe symptoms.

A release on ScienceDaily quoted review author Dr. Andrew Dhawan of the Cleveland Clinic, who is a member of the academy: “Although the international community seeks to reduce global temperature rise to under 2.7 ºF before 2100, irreversible environmental changes have already occurred, and as the planet warms these changes will continue to occur.” He added, “As we witness the effects of a warming planet on human health, it is imperative that neurologists anticipate how neurologic disease may change.”

Nor were those the only risks. High temperatures and flooding also increase tick and mosquito activity, which increases the likelihood of tick- and mosquito-borne illness, like West Nile virus. Warmer weather also creates conditions that help nervous system disorders like meningitis, polio and encephalitis occur.

Per The Daily Mail, “The study did not reflect on why dementia or multiple sclerosis may get worse with climate change.” The article theorizes, “It could be because elderly people are more at risk of health conditions generally during the heat, in part due to their age but also because they tend to live alone and may not drink enough.”

Dhawan said the review did not find studies that looked at the impact of food and water insecurity on neurologic health, though “these are clearly linked to neurologic health and climate change,” suggesting a need for more study in that area.

And the researchers noted that the studies were from parts of the world that are rich in resources and where lots of research is conducted. Other regions might be even more impacted by climate change, but have fewer resources to examine the impact.

Among the mechanisms of climate change, the researchers cited dehydration, which leads to brain shrinkage that puts pressure on nerves and causes pain."

A new review found climate change is associated with worsening symptoms of multiple sclerosis and other neurologic diseases.

The effects are due to the effects of temperature fluctuations, extreme weather events and airborne pollution.

Around 100 million Americans currently suffer from a disorder that affects the brain, nerves or spinal cord.

Climate change may be making the symptoms of headaches, dementia, multiple sclerosis (MS) and Parkinson’s disease worse, according to results of a new review.

It’s estimated around 100 million Americans suffer from at least one neurologic disease and their prevalence is growing.

Researchers in the review, which was published in the journal Neurology, assessed more than 360 articles published between 1990 and 2022 to determine to what extent temperature changes, extreme weather events and air pollution affect neurologic diseases.

They found that those with certain diseases could experience worse symptoms due to climate change and that the phenomenon may also result in an increased prevalence of stroke. Up to 4 percent of stroke risk could be attributed to temperature and its variability alone, authors wrote.

“Although the international community seeks to reduce global temperature rise to under 2.7 ºF before 2100, irreversible environmental changes have already occurred, and as the planet warms these changes will continue to occur,” said review author Andrew Dhawan of Cleveland Clinic in Ohio and a member of the American Academy of Neurology in a statement.

“As we witness the effects of a warming planet on human health, it is imperative that neurologists anticipate how neurologic disease may change.”

All of the studies, which only contained data on adults, were broken down into three categories: studies on the impact of pollution; extreme weather events and temperature fluctuations; and emerging neuroinfectious diseases.

The studies also detailed associations between warming climates and tick- and mosquito-borne infections.

The review found that extreme weather events and temperature changes were linked with stroke incidence and severity, migraines, hospitalization among patients with dementia and worsening MS.

In the past 10 years alone, 90 percent of U.S. counties have experienced at least one federal climate disaster.

Exposure to airborne pollutants, especially particulate matter 2.5 — “pollutant particles of less than 2.5 microns in diameter” — and nitrates, were associated with stroke incidence and severity, headaches, dementia risk, Parkinson’s disease and MS exacerbation, authors added.

Climate change also increases favorable conditions for certain diseases like West Nile Virus, meningococcal meningitis and tick-borne encephalitis to propagate beyond traditional regions, posing heightened disease risks in new populations.

In 2022, there were more than 900 reported cases of West Nile Virus in the United States, according to the CDC.

The findings come on the heels of research that found one way to prevent future pandemics is to stop destroying natural wildlife habitats. As more species’ habitats are destroyed and animals migrate to different regions, often closer to humans, it increases the risk of diseases spreading across species.

Several mechanisms could explain the relationship between climate change and physiological changes, including a phenomenon of accelerated aging, researchers wrote.

Articles included in the review tended to be conducted in resource-rich regions, suggesting a disconnect between where research takes places and where changes are most acute, they added. Low-income countries, despite contributing the least to climate change, often bear a disproportionate burden of its consequences.

As the planet becomes warmer, people with neurologic diseases such as headaches, dementia, multiple sclerosis (MS) and Parkinson’s disease may experience worsening symptoms, scientists have warned.

A review of studies published on climate change and neurologic diseases showed that extreme weather events and fluctuations in temperature were associated with a higher prevalence of stroke, as well as migraine headaches, hospitalisation of dementia patients, and worsening MS.

Extreme weather events and temperature fluctuations were particularly linked to these symptoms becoming more severe.

The review, published in the Neurology journal of the American Academy of Neurology on Wednesday (16 November), also showed that climate change resulted in “favourable conditions” that encourage the spread of neuroinfectious diseases, such as West Nile virus, meningococcal meningitis, and tick-borne encephalitis.

Such conditions have expanded “beyond the traditional geographic areas” due to global warming and these diseases carried by animals and insects put new populations at risk, it said.

Exposure to airborne pollutants, like nitrates and fine particulate matter, has also been associated with stroke incidence and severity, headaches, dementia risk, Parkinson’s disease and worsening of MS, the review added.

Dr Andrew Dhawan, from the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio and author of the review, said that despite the international community’s attempts to reduce global temperature rise to under 2C, “irreversible environmental changes have already occurred”.

“As we witness the effects of a warming planet on human health, it is imperative that neurologists anticipate how neurologic disease may change,” he added.

The review, which looked at studies published on climate change, pollutants, temperature extremes and neurologic diseases between 1990 and 2022, found 364 relevant studies in three categories.

This included 289 studies on the impact of pollution, 38 on extreme weather events and temperature fluctuations, and 37 on emerging neuroinfectious diseases.

But Dr Dhawan said some of the challenges posed by climate change on humanity are “not well-studied”.

“For example, our review did not find any articles related to effects on neurological health from food and water insecurity, yet these are clearly linked to neurologic health and climate change,” he explained.

“More studies are needed on ways to reduce neuroinfectious disease transmission, how air pollution affects the nervous system, and how to improve delivery of neurologic care in the face of climate-related disruptions.”"

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt (Reuters) - Negotiators at the COP27 climate summit in Egypt must overcome a ""breakdown in trust"" between rich and poor nations to deliver a deal to save the world from the worst of global warming, U.N. chief Antonio Guterres said on Thursday.

""We are at crunch time in the negotiations,"" he said, as a Friday deadline looms for a deal to emerge from the two-week conference. ""The world is watching and has a simple message: stand and deliver.""

""Global emissions are at their highest level in history - and rising. Climate impacts are decimating economies and societies - and growing. We know what we need to do - and we have the tools and resources to get it done,"" he said.

His speech was intended to rally negotiators that have become stuck on issues from whether a fund should be established to compensate poor nations for climate damage already ocurring, to language around fossil fuels use.

Political Cartoons on World Leaders View All 191 Images

Wealthy nations, including the United States, have opposed creating a new loss and damage fund to support developing countries ravaged by climate change for fear it could expose them to limitless liability for their historic contribution to greenhouse gas emissions.

""There is clearly a breakdown in trust between North and South, and between developed and emerging economies. This is no time for finger pointing,"" Guterres said.

Guterres said he hopes to see negotiators bridge their differences on loss and damage in a way that reflects the ""urgency, scale and enormity of the challenge faced by developing countries.""

""No one can deny the scale of loss and damage we see around the globe,"" he said. ""The world is burning and drowning before our eyes.""

He added he wanted to see countries commit to do more to reduce their emissions to achieve an international goal set in past COPs to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celcius, including by restricting fossil fuel usage.

""Fossil fuel expansion is hijacking humanity,"" he said. Any hope of meeting the 1.5 target requires a step change in emissions reductions.""

He also urged developed countries to deliver on a past pledge to provide $100 billion per year to help poor nations adapt to climate change and switch to clean energy.

Nov 18 (Reuters) - Climate change-related litigation has more than doubled in the past seven years globally according to a June report by the London School of Economics, and is moving beyond traditionally polluting industries such as fossil fuel production.

At the COP27 climate talks in Egypt, U.N. experts last week warned that many corporate environmental claims amounted to “empty slogans and hype.” This could embolden campaigners to launch more legal cases against climate-action laggards.

Meanwhile litigation against Big Oil continues apace with climate campaigners notching a notable win on the world stage in 2021 when a Dutch court ordered Royal Dutch Shell to drastically cut emissions. In the United States, cities and states remain on course in early efforts to bring Exxon, BP and others to trial, hoping they can get the companies to help pay for climate adaptation measures like sea walls and energy efficiency upgrades. The oil companies say they can’t be held responsible for a global phenomenon such as climate change and that policy change should come from governments not courtrooms.

Below, a look at some of climate litigation's newest targets.

PLASTICS

Companies that make and market plastics, which are derived from fossil fuels, have been defending against a growing set of cases worldwide focused on the waste from the ubiquitous packaging material.

In July, a U.S. federal judge in California granted preliminary approval for a $10 million settlement after single-serve coffee U.S. company Keurig was sued by consumers who accused it of inaccurately marketing its K-Cups as recyclable even though they are not in many localities. Keurig has denied wrongdoing and liability.

Another suit, filed in California state court in 2020 by the U.S. environmental group Earth Island Institute against Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Nestlé and several other global consumer goods companies, seeks to hold those companies accountable for their alleged contributions to plastic pollution. The suit raises public nuisance, breach of warranty and negligence claims.

The companies have denied the allegations in the lawsuits but have made public promises to work to avoid plastic pollution. In January, Coca-Cola, Pepsi and other international brands called for a global pact to combat plastic pollution, including by cutting plastic production.

Internationally, climate activists have targeted plastics makers by challenging government building permits for facilities that produce plastics. A lawsuit announced this year by London-based environmental law firm ClientEarth and other nonprofits is trying to kill a $3.1 billion facility proposed by British petrochemical giant Ineos in Belgium that would produce plastic feedstock ethylene, claiming approvals by the Flemish government failed to take into account the environmental impact of the plant. The facility would convert fracked shale gas into the chemical, a key building block for durable and ""single-use"" plastics, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

An Ineos spokesperson says the plant will make ""one of chemistry’s main building blocks that goes into a broad range of products essential in everyday life.""

FOOD INDUSTRY

Climate activists also have targeted the food industry, claiming companies overstate how climate-friendly their products are.

Sweden-based Oatly, which advertises its oat-based milk alternative as the result of a less water-intensive process than that of traditional dairy milk, was hit with three lawsuits in 2021 by investors who claimed in U.S. federal court in New York the statements amounted to “greenwashing,” in which a company touts its operations as more environmentally sustainable than they are. An Oatly spokesperson declined to comment on pending litigation.

In Denmark, the European Union’s biggest pork producer, Danish Crown, was hit with a lawsuit last year alleging the company misrepresents its climate footprint through marketing that says its production is “more climate friendly than you think."" Danish Crown didn't respond to a request for comment but has pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% in 2030.

A lawsuit filed by indigenous groups in France claims French supermarket chain Casino has systematically violated human rights and environmental laws by selling beef linked to land grabbing and deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. The suit claims the company is violating a 2017 ""duty of vigilance"" law in France that demands companies avoid human rights and environmental violations in supply chains. The company has claimed it has a rigorous policy establishing criteria for suppliers to comply with including ""zero Amazon deforestation"" and no slave-like working conditions.

BANKS AND INVESTMENT FIRMS

The world's financial giants face claims by consumers who say they are failing to reduce environmental harms and are misrepresenting certain investments as environmentally friendly.

A group of environmental nonprofits in October announced they have initiated a legal process in France against BNP Paribas, which the nonprofits called the ""largest financier of fossil fuel expansion in Europe."" The group claims the fossil fuel investments violate the French duty of vigilance law requiring corporations to identify and reduce environmental harms. The group, led by Oxfam France and Friends of the Earth France, called the move an ""unprecedented legal action."" BNP Paribas did not respond to a request for comment.

A German consumer group in October sued Deutsche Bank's asset management unit DWS, alleging it misrepresented a fund's green credentials in marketing materials. The lawsuit claims DWS told investors that it invests 0% in controversial sectors such as coal, but elsewhere indicated revenue from the coal industry accounts for as much as 15% of the fund's revenue. DWS has repeatedly denied misleading investors.

The crowd was loving what Bhekumuzi Bhebhe had to say, cheering loudly as he yelled “don’t gas Africa!” into the megaphone.

Standing under the baking Egyptian sun at the COP27 UN climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh on Tuesday, Bhebhe, a South Africa-based climate campaigner, was protesting against what he says is an attempt by rich countries to bribe Africa into investing in planet-warming fossil fuels.

In his mind, it’s yet another example of the hypocrisy western countries have showed toward the continent – which has barely contributed to the climate crisis but is experiencing some of its most devastating effects.

“Is this justice?!” he asked his fellow protesters. “No!” the crowd yelled back.

The Egyptian government, which is hosting and presiding over the UN-sponsored climate talks, had promised this year’s summit would finally be the “African COP” that would put the needs of the continent front and center.

Unfulfilled promises

But according to many representatives of countries across Africa, that promise remains largely unfulfilled.

Mohamed Adow, the director and founder of Power Shift Africa, a non-governmental organization focused on accelerating renewable energy there, said at an event on Sunday that the developments so far show the conference was “African in the name only.”

Any hopes that the summit would really focus on Africa were dashed early, when the conference participants denied a request by a group of African governments to include a discussion about the continent’s “special needs and circumstances” on the official agenda.

Philip Osano, the director of the Africa Center at the Stockholm Environment Institute, told CNN that the recognition of the special circumstances was one of the top three priorities for many African governments, along with climate finance and the clean energy transition.

“Africa contributes less than 4.8% of emissions, but the impacts have now become very serious, that’s why this is a priority item,” he said.

“The bad news is, it’s off the agenda. But it’s very complicated, because other parts of the world – especially small island states, developing countries – everybody is kind of having a special circumstance when it comes to climate.”

Mithika Mwenda, the Kenyan co-founder of the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance, said he was “outraged” by the decision not to include the discussion on the agenda. Speaking after the item was struck, Mwenda said the development “set the stage for another COP that will fail millions of Africans dying unjustly” from climate change.

This year's climate conference was widely billed as ""Africa COP."" Ivana Kottasova/CNN

Paying for loss and damage

Some of the leaders of countries that are most vulnerable to the climate crisis – many of which are in Africa – have come to Sharm el Sheikh with high hopes that developed countries would finally agree to pay for the loss and damage already caused by climate change.

The idea is simple: countries that got rich using fossil fuels that have caused the crisis should help those that are most affected by it deal with the devastating consequences.

Going into the summit, leaders of climate-vulnerable countries said this was their number one priority, and there was hope that a new funding facility could be established this year. But negotiations have proven tough. Some of the richest countries are united in pushing against the idea of setting up a new fund.

The United States, the European Union and the United Kingdom have all been trying to kick the can down the road, saying they want to establish a “process” that would lead to an “outcome” by 2024.

But for countries that are seeing their coasts disappear and their people drown in devastating floods or starve because of droughts, that is not good enough.

“We had pledges, statements and commitments. But we need comprehensive proposals. We already have concept notes, we already have proposals, we already have our [emission cutting plans], we need to move into implementations,” Edward Bendu, the chief environmental officer at Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Lands, Country Planning and the Environment, told CNN in an interview at the summit.

Bendu, who is representing a country that is among the most impacted by the climate crisis, said that access to existing climate finance is difficult and that the current financing options are not fit for purpose.

“It takes about three four years to access funds,” he said. “That’s too late for us, we can’t address the loss and damage issues that way.”

There have been some positive movements coming from the summit. Germany has been spearheading a new loss and damage program called the Global Shield that it hopes would make money available faster for countries suffering from weather disasters.

The EU and several of its member states announced Wednesday they “will provide over €1 billion ($1.04 billion) for climate adaptation in Africa.” The bloc also said it would add €60 million ($62.2 million) to the loss and damage pot.

But as is often the case with climate finance announcements, the devil is in the detail.

Delving into the figures, it emerged that of the €345 million ($357 million) the European Commission would contribute to the package, only €220 million ($228 million) is a “new commitment,” according to a statement released Wednesday.

The rest of the €345m was already pledged elsewhere in the past. And as for the €60 million for loss and damage, that money is included in the €220 million rather than being an additional sum. The EU didn’t give a breakdown on the contributions from individual states. CNN has contacted the bloc for comment and more details on the announcement.

For the developing world, the bottom line remains that the promise of funding remains unfulfilled. Under the Paris Agreement, rich countries pledged to provide $100 billion a year in climate financing to developing world by 2020. Two years after the deadline, the target has still not been met.

Energy front end center

The battle over Africa’s future energy infrastructure has emerged as one of the key issues at the summit.

Around 600 million Africans don’t have access to electricity and almost a billion don’t have clean cooking facilities, relying instead on burning solid biomass, kerosene or coal as their primary cooking fuel, according to the International Energy Agency.

Experts and activists are stressing that many African countries are getting locked in fossil fuel investments that are polluting and will likely prove uneconomical in a few years.

It is not a hypothetical issue. Many of the world’s richest countries are pushing for more fossil fuel investments in several African countries as they try to wean themselves of Russian gas because of the war in Ukraine.

The German Chancellor Olaf Scholz flew to Dakar earlier this year and held talks with the Senegalese president Macky Sall – the chair of the African Union – about the development of a new offshore natural gas field. And earlier this month, the Italian energy giant ENI started exporting natural gas from a new deep sea gas field in Mozambique.

These developments are making activists particularly furious.

“It’s a hypocrisy and we are calling it out,” said Omar Elmaawi, a Kenyan activist who has spent years campaigning against the planned East African Crude Oil Pipeline, which is meant to transport oil from Uganda to Tanzania, where it could be sold on international markets.

“Africa has contributed very little to the climate problem, but the fossil fuel companies are using that to their advantage. They say Africa has been left behind and therefore they want to explore the potential so that they can help us develop,” Elmaawi told CNN.

“But that narrative doesn’t hold up because although they’re calling it ‘development’ they want to exploit these resources and send them into the Global North,” he added.

Elmaawi said he understood the money big fossil fuel companies are offering may look like a lucrative option to some African governments. But he and his fellow activist say they want their governments to think about the future.

“My assessment has always been either our government leaders are really ignorant and stupid, or, some of them have been compromised and they are not working in the best interest of their people,” he said.

What Elmaawi, Adow and other activists want is for the COP27 conference to help African countries foster more investment into renewable energy.

According to the IEA, Africa has around 60% of the world’s best solar-energy resources, but only 1% of installed photovoltaic capacity.

Adow said Africa could easily become a renewable energy superpower.

But instead, he said, “European countries want to turn Africa into their gas station.”"

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Eleven-year-old Indian climate activist Licypriya Kangujam's dogged questioning of Britain's climate minister Zac Goldsmith about the fate of climate activists detained in his country was one of the most striking moments in the COP27 global warming talks so far.

""We need to hold lawmakers accountable for their political decisions,"" she later told Reuters.

Among the throngs of men and women in business attire at the COP27 United Nations climate summit in Egypt this week are children who have traveled from around the world to demand adult leaders take action to protect their futures. They may be small, but their voices have been some of the loudest in the climate action movement.

""Many children are going to lose their beautiful futures,"" Kangujam said. ""My generation is already the victims of the climate crisis. I don't want more future generations to face the same consequences.""

Footage showed Goldsmith smiling incredulously when she told him her age, and then walking away, pursued persistently by the young activist until he found an exit from the conference building.

Kangujam was born in 2011, two years after richer countries first agreed plans to channel up to $100 billion a year to poorer nations by 2020. That target, like several others, has slipped during her lifetime and will not be met until next year.

Countries like India have suffered in the interim. In 2018 and 2019, the state of Odisha, where Kangujam lived, was devastated by climate-fueled cyclones Titli and Fani.

Shortly after, Kangujam moved to New Delhi where her ""life was completely messed up due to the high air pollution level and heatwave crisis,"" she said.

Today, Kangujam is the founder of the Child Movement fighting for climate justice. Her involvement follows prominent youth activist Greta Thunberg, now 19, who led school strikes in Sweden to demand action.

Thunberg stayed away from the Sharm el-Sheikh talks which she described as an opportunity for ""greenwashing, lying and cheating"" by the powerful.

EDUCATION IMPACTS

Kangujam isn't the only child at COP27 with the hope that delegates at the 27th annual U.N. summit, aimed at confronting global warming, will recognize the struggles of Generations Z and Alpha, those born from 1996 to 2024.

Organisers of the summit say children have been given greater importance, with a designated youth envoy and a pavilion for children and youth at the conference.

Mustafa, a 12-year-old boy from the Upper Egyptian city of Minya on the western bank of the Nile River, came to COP27 with non-profit Save the Children to share his experience.

""We have very heavy rain in the village during winter,"" he said. Streets turn to muddy rivers and power outages blanket the town in darkness. Often, he said, he struggles to get to school.

A survey of 54,000 kids by Save the Children in October showed that 83% of children across 15 countries said they could see the impacts of climate change, inequality, or both.

""I see that climate change impacts education. Whenever something like this happens, we don't go to school. We can't even study due to the power cuts,"" he said.

For others, heat poses a greater threat. Mariam, a 16-year-old girl from Cairo, told Reuters that she struggled with heat exhaustion during the summer when temperatures now routinely climb near 40 degrees Celisus.

""I'm always tired and dizzy,"" she said. ""Sometimes I couldn't go to school and I skipped many important classes.

Both Mustafa and Mariam said they wanted world leaders to listen to children and take action.

World leaders at Cop27 are racing against the clock to hammer down the final details of their climate agreement on the crucial summit’s final day.

A draft version of the climate pact has been published but it is expected to change as negotiations continue.

The draft is padded with “placeholders” for the final decisions on key issues, which will be slotted in as they’re set.

As it stands, the agreement does not have a fund for climate compensation, a dominating issue of the two-week conference.

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt (Reuters) - The election of Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva as Brazil's next president is already boosting the country's credibility at this year's U.N. climate negotiations, with the left-wing leader to participate in COP27 in Egypt on Wednesday.

Lula defeated right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro, who presided over mounting destruction of the Amazon rainforest and refused to hold the 2019 climate summit originally planned for Brazil.

In his first international trip after being elected Oct. 31, Lula plans to deliver a speech with the message that ""Brazil is back"" as a leader confronting climate change, two of his advisors told Reuters.

Lula's sweeping plan promises to ramp up environmental law enforcement and create green jobs that do not come at the expense of the rainforest. Lula's team also worked to secure a jungle conservation alliance announced on Monday between the three largest rainforest nations - Brazil, Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Three Brazilian diplomats told Reuters the country was in a stronger position to negotiate at the U.N. talks, being held this year in Egypt's Sharm el-Sheikh, since other countries know they will soon have a Lula government behind them.

""Now, with this perspective of a more favorable view of the issue by the next Brazilian government, we would be even more empowered to interact with different interlocutors,"" one diplomat said.

The diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to speak with the media.

Brazil's negotiating positions have remained largely unchanged in recent decades, regardless of who has been president, and Lula is likely to make the same diplomatic demands as his predecessor, the diplomats said. That includes pushing for rich nations with high greenhouse gas emissions to pay poor nations for historic damage the climate.

Colombia's Environment Minister Susana Muhamad said Lula's election would allow for renewed regional cooperation among Amazon rainforest nations to tackle deforestation, a major contributor to climate change.

""There is a new political context in Latin America,"" Muhamad said. ""We have to work on a communal policy in the Amazon.""

She said Colombia and its own newly elected President Gustavo Petro support Lula's proposal for a summit of Amazon countries and developed nations interested in conservation.

Lula environmental advisor Izabella Teixeira said she felt the mood about Brazil has shifted at COP27 from previous summits.

""When I come to COP and meet people after the election of President Lula, there is hope,"" she said. ""People are so happy because Brazil will be back.""

Teixeira said Lula has received many requests for bilateral meetings, but none could be made public due to security concerns. A possible meeting with the U.S. delegation led by Climate Envoy John Kerry is under discussion.

Lula will also meet with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and has been invited to meet Egyptian President Abdul Fatah Khalil Al-Sisi, she said.

Last week, sources told Reuters that, at COP27, Lula plans to offer to host a future U.N. climate summit and to announce creation of a national climate authority to oversee all government work to address global warming.

Lula also plans to work with state governments in Brazil to combat deforestation. His first meeting on Wednesday will be with six Brazilian state governors from the Amazon region who are also at COP27, according to his public schedule.

On Thursday, Lula will meet with Brazilian civil society groups and indigenous representatives. He departs on Friday for Portugal.

Marina Silva, a former environment minister under Lula and an advisor on his campaign, said his coming to COP shows the high importance he places on climate.

""The big message is his presence here,"" she told reporters at the summit.

d22dd22f-96fe-4c49-91f0-67c1e4642789,"Itu, Sao Paulo State, Brazil CNN —

The drive through Sao Paulo state in Brazil is decidedly unremarkable, blocks and blocks of high-rise buildings give way to commuter highways and eventually to gentle rolling hills. It is hardly the scene where one would expect to find the climate’s salvation.

And yet as Luis Guedes Pinto climbed his sky-high perch above a reclaimed swath of Brazil’s Atlantic Forest, he explained you don’t have to go to the Arctic or even the Amazon to learn how to nurse Earth’s forests back to health.

“This project doesn’t change a big landscape, but it shows it’s possible to bring back life, to bring back water, to bring back biodiversity, to the center of the state of Sao Paulo,” said Pinto, the CEO at SOS Mata Atlântica, as he pointed down to two square miles of forest restoration.

Pinto’s organization is a non-profit devoted to rehabilitating the swath of forest on Brazil’s Atlantic coast. The forest itself is home to more than 145 million Brazilians, and — just as the Amazon rainforest has been ravaged by deforestation in the past several years — around three-quarters of it has already been wiped out by urban and infrastructure development and aggressive agribusiness practices.

“We need to plant and replant, but we cannot lose another acre,” Pinto said as he guided CNN through a nursery with more than 50 species of carefully cultivated trees and plants in what was once degraded, drought-prone pasture. “A forest we replant is not going to be the same as a forest we cut down. Some of the forests we’re losing have trees in them that are hundreds of years old.”

These are the seedlings of a forest’s revival. In just 15 years, it has become a thriving eco-lab with a healthy water table, trees, plants and animals. It is a completely different landscape to the pasture land on its borders, where drought-stricken grass overtakes acres of what was previously forest.

As president-elect Lula Da Silva comes into power, projects like this are now at the crossroads of climate and political history in Brazil, a country that is home to one of the planet’s most significant stores of biodiversity.

For nearly four years, the government of President Jair Bolsonaro was accused of undoing the environment progress of Lula, who served as president from 2003 through 2010. Data from Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research show the rate of deforestation under Bolsonaro’s presidency climbed by more than 70% from 2018 to 2021.

Already the Amazon rainforest is emitting more carbon dioxide than it absorbs in some locations — a shift that could have an enormous negative impact on global warming trends. And scientists warn the precious rainforest is nearing a point of irreversible decline and is less capable of recovering from disturbances like drought, logging and wildfires.

Lula’s record as former president shows his government was able to cut deforestation rates dramatically by the end of his term in 2010. And his new promise goes even further: to reach zero deforestation in Brazil. This would be substantially more ambitious than his previous government’s goal to eliminate illegal deforestation, not deforestation of all kinds.

Speaking at the UN’s COP27 climate summit on Wednesday in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, Lula told a jam-packed conference room that “Brazil is back to resume its ties with the world,” and there is “no climate security for the world without a protected Amazon, and we will do whatever it takes to have a different vision in the degradation.”

He also promised to punish those who are responsible for the deforestation in Amazon, and announced a new ministry for indigenous people “so that the indigenous people themselves can present and propose to the government about policies that can derive their survival with dignity and security, peace and sustainability.”

His remarks were met with huge applause that trickled out of the conference room into the hallway, where people who were not able to get into the crowded room, but eager to hear Lula speak on the climate crisis, watched from their phones.

But Bolsonaro allies, who continue to control congress, could make climate action much more difficult over the next four years. One of those allies is Ricardo Salles, Bolsonaro’s former environment minister and now a newly elected lawmaker in Brazil’s conservative-leaning congress.

In an interview with CNN, Salles said he and others are willing to work with Lula’s incoming administration on climate goals, but cautioned it should not come at the expense of economic development.

“I was the only guy as minister of environment in the entire history of the ministry who brought these economic questions to the table,” said Salles. During his time as environment minister, the Bolsonaro government often described development and economic activity in the Amazon as vital to longterm sustainability – an approach decried by many environmental activists in the country.

Salles says Brazil will have to work closely now with international allies into order to tap the billions of dollars in climate funds and carbon credits now on offer both by governments and businesses worldwide.

But climate advocates argue neither Brazil nor the planet can afford the kind of compromises now being advocated by Bolsonaro allies.

“We don’t need to destroy to develop. We can do that in harmony with nature. And it’s the indigenous peoples who teach that,” Brazilian indigenous leader Txai Suruí told CNN.

Suruí said she is optimistic Lula’s government will make good on promises to act quickly, despite the economic pressure from not only Bolsonaro allies, but millions in the Amazon whose livelihoods depend on its commercial development.

“Because that agenda — of the Amazon, of climate change, of the environment — it’s a global agenda,” she said. “If Lula does not address it, it won’t just be us, indigenous people, that will be knocking on his door, it’ll be the entire world.”

The urgency to commit to those goals is not lost on Pinto who says it’s not just Brazil’s future that is at stake.

“We need to understand as a nation that is key for the planet and that decisions we will make will be important for us but also for others,” he says.

0ba49e7c-9f2a-4e83-b53b-7ebd1bbdf7ca,"At COP27, Brazilian president-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has promised ""zero deforestation"" in the Amazon and to create a ""ministry of Indigenous people.""

One of the most-watched visitors to the UN climate summit in Egypt this week has been incoming Brazilian president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva — more commonly referred to as Lula.

With his successful election campaign having included a promise to arrest record deforestation in the Amazon, Lula carried huge expectations into the yearly climate summit aimed at curbing planet-heating emissions.

""The world is missing Brazil,"" said Lula in a speech at COP27 on Wednesday, adding that ""Brazil is back."" He stated his intention to set the nation on a path to ""defeat deforestation and global warming.""

Describing the ""climate denialism"" of outgoing president Jair Bolsonaro, Lula said the ""survival of the Amazon forest"" was on the line during the recent election.

The Amazon is the world's largest tropical forest. It helps regulate climate and especially rainfall across the Americas, making it a vital source of water for those in the region. But nearly 20% has disappeared since 1970 through logging and burning. The massive carbon sink has even started to emit more carbon than it stores due to clearing, in part to make way for cattle and soy crops.

During Lula's last stint in power from 2003 to 2010, his left-wing government reduced Amazon deforestation by an estimated 67%. Much of that work was undone under Bolonaro's reign, when Amazon deforestation soared to alarming rates.

Deforestation hit record highs in September and October of this year, with environmental group WWF stating that the ""unbridled"" destruction would likely continue until Lula's government takes full power on January 1, 2023.

The logging and burning of the forest — the majority of which lies in Brazil — also fueled a near 10% rise in Brazil's annual CO2 emissions in 2020.

At COP27, Lula reiterated his promise to end deforestation — and to protect the territorial rights of Indigenous people in the region whose land has been exploited by loggers, miners and squatters under Bolsonaro's rule.

Confirming his plan to strengthen oversight in the Amazon, he said the 28 million people living in the rainforests can become the ""protaginists of their own conservation"" through the creation of a new Ministry of Indigenous People.

""We are going to make a big fight against illegal deforestation,"" he said at the UN talks.

""We are going to take very good care of the Indigenous people,"" added Lula.

Turning Lula's climate rhetoric into action

Before arriving at the COP27 talks in Sharm el-Sheik, Lula said he intended to have more meetings with world leaders on climate solutions in one day than Bolsonaro had in four years, the AFP news agency reported.

Finding ways to combat illegal destruction of the Amazon has to be a central part of these talks, say campaigners.

""Lula should specify how he plans to uphold the rule of law in the Amazon and protect both the forest and its defenders as soon as he takes office,"" said Maria Laura Canineu, Brazil director at Human Rights Watch, in the week after his October 30 victory.

Puyr Tembe, who is at COP27 representing Brazil's Teneteara people, called for Lula to ""deliver his campaign promises"" to combat deforestation and protect Indigenous lands.

""Brazil can be a role model to other countries in terms of combating deforestation, combating land grabbing,"" she said.

The nation did commit to forest preservation this week when it signed a trilateral alliance with the Democratic Republic of Congo and Indonesia to protect over half of the world's tropical rainforest, according to Reuters.

Lula, who is a veteran of climate negotiations during his first two terms in office, plans to meet with US climate envoy John Kerry to shore up global cooperation on saving the Amazon — and to announce Brazil's willingness to host the COP30 summit in 2025, according to Brazilian newspaper ""O Globo.""

Lula's former and likely future environment minister, Marina Silva, has already been holding meetings at the UN summit.

Speaking to Brazilian media at COP27, Silva said Lula's Workers' Party had once been responsible for 80% of the protected forest areas created globally.

The world wants to see Brazil again exert a leadership role, she added. After meetings last week with John Kerry and the directors of the World Bank, ""there is a willingness to invest in Brazil again,"" she said.

This includes picking up on Mercosur agreement negotiations with the European Union. The agreement is a trade deal with Latin American states that includes robust climate commitments.

Germany wants to revive Amazon Fund

At COP27, Lula will also be looking to revive a coalition once committed to ending illegal logging in Brazil, but which fell apart under Bolsonaro's watch. Marina Silva has begun the process, having asked the US to also join the Amazon Fund set up in partnership with Germany and Norway in 2008 to help finance the protection of the region — and biodiversity.

In early November, a German development ministry spokesperson said the country wants to release funds for the protection of the Amazon rainforest under the deal. Norway also said it would resume financial aid to Brazil under the fund.

The two countries stopped making payments in 2019 after Bolsonaro took office and weakened environmental protection measures in the Amazon.

Under Bolsonaro, illegal deforestation has resulted in violence against Indigenous people, while the state has criminalized local resistance, said Puyr Tembe of the Teneteara people.

""Lula's arrival is the rebirth of hope, the rebirth of peace in our territories and the rebirth of a more environmental worldview than we have in Brazil today,"" Tembe said.

16 Nov 2022 05.11 AEDT We’re winding up for the day here, after all that Lula excitement. Time for a round of Caipirinhas please! While they’re being mixed, what happened on day nine? SUMMARY: The Brazilian president-elect, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (Lula for short), addressed Cop27 and promised that “Brazil is back”.

He confirmed that Germany and Norway will reopen the Amazon fund, called for Cop30 to be held in the Amazon rainforest, and announced that he would be setting up a ministry for Indigenous people.

Lula also said that it is time to reform the UN and the global settlement. “The world has changed.”

Elsewhere, Costa Rica which now has a new leader, has backed away from the coalition it co-founded to end oil and gas

Interest in a proposal to “phase down all fossil fuels” is growing, with even the US now giving (extremely qualified) support

There is continuing anxiety over the glacial progress over loss and damage negotiations. The Alliance of Small Island States, a negotiating bloc, fear many developed countries are backtracking on their commitment to make progress.

There is anxiety elsewhere too, that countries are trying to backslide on their climate commitments, with the first tentative drafts of decisions from the summit showing attempts to unpick agreements and water down promises. That’s it for today! My colleague Sandra Laville will be blogging first thing in the morning. Thanks for joining us!



16 Nov 2022 04.43 AEDT Support for a proposal to ""phase down all fossil fuels"" is growing According to Bloomberg, the US’s climate envoy John Kerry is now giving his backing to “a proposal to phase down all fossil fuels at the UN climate conference as long as it focuses on projects with unchecked emissions”. India has already called for all countries to commit to phasing down fossil fuels with the UK’s backing, and earlier in the week the EU joined the call too. Bloomberg reports Kerry as saying: “It has to be unabated oil and gas … Phase down, unabated, over time. The time is a question, but ‘phase down’ is the language we supported.” Support for the principle appears to be widening. Tuvalu’s Minister of Finance, Seve Paeniu, says: “Tuvalu welcomes India and the European Unions suggestion to include ‘all’ fossil fuel phase out in the COP27 cover text and encourages governments to join this call in the face of the climate emergency. The world needs a just and equitable energy transition, and investing in 100% renewable energy is the only way to achieve this.” And Stephanie Crouzat, the climate ambassador for France, says: “India is floating the idea to phase down all fossil fuels, I think we should take them up on it. We should push phasing down and eventually phasing out.”

16 Nov 2022 04.13 AEDT Damian Carrington Vulnerable developing nations are getting very worried about the loss and damage negotiations at Cop27. The issue of funds to recover from the climate disasters that poorer nations did very little to cause is pivotal to the success of the summit. But the Alliance of Small Island States, a negotiating bloc, fear many developed countries are backtracking on their commitment to make progress. Molwyn Joseph, Aosis chair and the environment and health minister of Antigua and Barbuda, said: “Aosis and our fellow developing countries have toiled for the past 30 years to be heard on this issue. We have come too far to fail. But some developed countries are furiously trying to stall progress and even worse, attempting to undermine small island developing states. So, not only are they causing the worst impacts of the climate crisis, they are playing games with us.” “There have only been informal consultations, to date, on this critical agenda item, and no official launch of negotiations.” “If other countries continue to cast aside small islands to serve the interests of the fossil fuel industry, they cannot expect our people to swim in a stagnant pool. The tide has turned on loss and damage. Why do you continue to turn a deaf ear to the cries of our people? I am being very clear – small island developing states will no longer stand for delay on loss and damage finance.”



16 Nov 2022 03.50 AEDT The news that Germany and Norway will reopen the Amazon fund has been welcomed. Arild Skedsmo, senior analyst at Norway’s largest private pension company, KLP (which controls about US$80bn) says: “In Norway, we had an immediate positive reaction to Lula’s victory with our government offering to reopen access to the financial resources of the Amazon Fund. These resources were frozen as a result of the negative policy actions by outgoing President Bolsonaro that drove deforestation to record high levels and undermined indigenous rights.” He welcomed Lula’s speech. “The President-elect is right to emphasise that the survival of Amazon is needed for survival of the planet given the threat of climate change. It is welcome that Lula emphasised protection in all Brazil’s biomes including with international support. Indigenous peoples’ rights are now back high on the agenda as Lula vowed to promote indigenous peoples as protagonists and beneficiaries which is a very welcome, stark change from the outgoing President’s policies.”



16 Nov 2022 03.26 AEDT Hallo, I’m Bibi van der Zee and I’ll be taking over from my colleague Patrick Greenfield for the last couple of hours of the day. The excitement of the speech from President Lula is still making itself felt. Brazil is back in the fight was his main message, and it seems to have resonated with so many of those listening.

16 Nov 2022 03.03 AEDT It's time to reform the UN, says Lula Lula challenges the current global settlement. “When I was president of Brazil, I said the UN had to advance. I can’t imagine that the UN is directed by the same geopolitical rational of world war two. The world has changed. Continents want to be represented. There’s no explanation why the winners of world war two should be in charge and the directors of the UN security council. The world needs new global governance on the climate issue.” Brazil’s president-elect tells Cop27: ‘I want to make a fairer world.’ Photograph: Ahmad Gharabli/AFP/Getty Images He adds: “If there’s one thing we need to change on global governance, it’s climate change. Otherwise time goes by, we die and things do not change. It’s with this objective that I came back to unite us. I didn’t come back to do what I did already. I came back to do more. I want to make a fairer world and a more effective humanity. Thank you very much.” Cheers once again, as he bows to the audience then pauses to have his picture taken with some of them. There is a general starstruck feeling in the room.

Updated at 03.33 AEDT

16 Nov 2022 03.00 AEDT Lula says when Brazil chairs the G20 summit in 2024, the climate agenda will be one of the main priorities. He will be pressing rich countries to discuss their promises. “I would like to remind you that rich countries said they would raise $100bn at Cop15 in Copenhagen to help the less developed countries to face climate change.” This has not, as everyone knows, happened. He says that is what leads us to another important theme of this Cop. “We need financial mechanisms to remedy loss and damage caused by climate change. We cannot postpone this debate. We need to deal with the reality of countries that have to protect the territorial integrity of their countries threatened. It is time to act. We cannot live with this rush towards the abyss.”

16 Nov 2022 02.57 AEDT Now he puts forward two proposals. The first is a meeting of the Amazon countries to look at the integrated development of the region. “The second proposal is for Brazil to host Cop30 in 2025.” (Cheers from the audience who seem enthusiastic about being in Brazil in November.) “There are many cities that could host Cop30. I want to say it should be in the Amazon region.” He says he would like everyone here to understand the importance of this part of the world.

16 Nov 2022 02.55 AEDT He says: “I am sure that Brazilian agri-business will be a strategic ally in our government looking for regenerative and sustainable agriculture. We have 30m hectares of degraded lands. We don’t need to deforest one square metre to be one of the largest food producers in the world. “That’s why we are proposing a world alliance for food security and the reduction of inequality.” He is seeking cooperation between the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Indonesia and Brazil, the countries that have 52% of primary forests. “We will seek financing mechanisms to stop the advancement of global warming.”

Updated at 03.05 AEDT

16 Nov 2022 02.52 AEDT He now announces that Germany and Norway are restarting the Amazon fund, which was shut down under the previous Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro. “We are open to international cooperation to conserve our biomes. But always under Brazilian sovereignty. We will never give it up,” Lula says.

We will do whatever it takes to have zero deforestation and degradations of our biomes. “For this reason, I would like to announce that efforts to fight climate change will have the highest profile in my next government. We will prioritise the fight against deforestation of all of our biomes and reverse years of the previous governments. In 2021, we had a deforestation of 13,000 sq km. The destruction will stay in the past. “Environmental crimes have grown in a scary way under the previous government. We will strengthen oversight bodies. We will punish illegal activities: gold miners, loggers, farmers.” Lula also announces a ministry for Indigenous people. “These actions affect native people above all. That is why we will create a ministry of native people so they can have their own voice.”

In the US, they live with tropical storms and more and more powerful storms. In Brazil, which is a forest and hydro power, we experienced drought and experienced devastating floods. Europe faces an extreme heat situation with fires and unprecedented deaths. “And although it is the continent with the lowest GHG emissions, Africa has drought. I repeat: nobody is safe.”

Brazil is back to resume its ties with the world and to once again fight hunger in the world. To cooperate once again with the poorest countries – above all Africa – to cooperate with technology transfers to build a better future for our peoples. “We are back. We are back to help build a peaceful world order based on dialogue and multilateralism. The world of today is not the same as the world in 1945.” He says the veto power of the security council must be ended for true peace.

We reduced deforestation 83% while increasing agricultural GDP 75%.”

As Scientific American pointed out, for decades both the oil and tobacco industries have employed Hill & Knowlton to downplay the dangers of their products by fanning nonexistent scientific doubt—most recently to undermine with misinformation the overwhelming scientific consensus on the human causes of climate change.

H&K’s Egyptian clients are hosting the world’s delegates, scientists, journalists, and civil society representatives while imprisoning many environmental activists at home, as Naomi Klein revealed recently in The Intercept—major human rights violations that should become a public relations crisis. Another twist: The Egyptian news site Mada Masr, which itself has faced numerous threats for its reporting, revealed that in just the last few months, President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, chief convener of COP27, obtained financing from the Saudi royal family—one of the biggest obstacles for climate action—for the government’s own media outlet to transmit news on the negotiations.



Nations impacted by fossil fuel-driven storms, floods, and sea level rise are demanding reparations from the largest producers of greenhouse gas emissions.



Looking for a local angle? Hill & Knowlton has at least 11 offices in the United States, including in New York City; Washington, D.C.; Chicago; Tampa and Miami, Florida; San Francisco and Los Angeles; and Austin, Texas. How deeply will the firm be collaborating with one of the Arab world’s most repressive regimes? Will it be suggesting to its Egyptian hosts that holding activists in prison who otherwise might even be present at the negotiations might present, at minimum, a public relations issue? How will Hill & Knowlton handle contentious negotiations that involve its former and possible future clients in the fossil fuel industry?

COP27 marks the 27th time that the “Conference of the Parties” have met under the auspices of the U.N. to address climate change. For 26 of those years, the costs of what the U.N. calls “loss and damages,” i.e., compensation for the costs of upended lives from extreme climate events, has been a third rail at the climate talks. Nations impacted by fossil fuel-driven storms, floods, and sea level rise are demanding reparations from the largest producers of those emissions, previously to no avail.

But this year, as the costs and consequences mount, loss and damages continues to be, according to the Climate News Network, a “geopolitical hurricane” that has been upending the negotiations. This makes the oil industry uneasy. Leading the list of global greenhouse gas emitters are ExxonMobil, Chevron, and Saudi Aramco, former and possibly future clients of Hill and Knowlton.

Americology: Arts of courtship

Hmmm, “loss and damages.” Where have I heard that before? In the U.S., such battles go under a different name. They’re called court cases.

Across the United States, cities and states have filed lawsuits also demanding that fossil fuel companies pay their share of the billions of dollars in damages that state and local governments are incurring to respond to the numerous consequences of climate extremes.

Such climate extremes have always occurred on Earth, but scientists are obtaining a clearer view of how they might now be attributed to atmospheric greenhouse gases through advances in “climate attribution science,” which could be key to the fate of the loss and damage lawsuits underway in the U.S.

So, as the debate rages in far-off Sharm el-Sheikh, it’s worth considering the local angles on America’s own losses and damages. These include the counties of Honolulu and Maui in Hawaii, which allege that Sonoco and other greenhouse gas emitting oil companies bear, according to the complaint, at least partial responsibility for the damages including sea level rise and related flooding, beach erosion, loss of fresh water supplies; habitat loss for endemic species; and social and economic consequences of all these environmental changes. The merged Honolulu and Maui cases went before the 9th Circuit this summer, and the court remanded the case back to state court.



Are the record profits for ExxonMobil a reflection of the inflation we’re all experiencing, or are the company’s escalating prices helping cause the inflation we’re all experiencing?



In another case, the city of Hoboken, New Jersey, joined by the state of Delaware, alleges similar damages against ExxonMobil and others. An amici curiae brief supporting that claim from the National League of Cities might as well have been written by the governments of the countries most vulnerable to climate change that will lead the charge on loss and damages at the negotiations in Egypt. The League argues in its brief to the Third Circuit that greenhouse gases may come from multiple sources in different locales but most of them emanate collectively from a small number of industries and, from the vulnerable countries’ perspective, nations.

At least half a dozen other similar cases filed by U.S. cities and counties are making their way through the courts, including the city of Annapolis, Maryland v. BP; the cities of Oakland and San Francisco v. BP and other fossil fuel companies; and the county of San Mateo, Calif., v. Chevron.

The Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University has compiled a database that includes relevant filings with background on climate disruptions in specific locales (as well as international cases), and can be handy for checking on cases in your own neighborhood.

Election & Inflation

Let’s take a moment to reflect on two converging facts that have coursed through the midterm election campaign. Fact one: the rate of inflation is indeed hitting record levels, or levels unseen since the early 1980s. Fact two: in the last week of October, ExxonMobil reported another quarter of record-breaking profits to shareholders—a threefold increase over the same quarter in 2021. (Other oil companies reported similar earnings.)

Two records, one question: Are the profits for ExxonMobil a reflection of the inflation we’re all experiencing—which would mean higher revenues but not necessarily higher profits—or are the company’s escalating prices for gasoline helping cause the inflation we’re all experiencing?

The answer to that question, which could be asked of any oil company today, might offer rich terrain for stories adding real dimension to the “rocketing inflation” news which American media have reported. Like climate change and inflation, we’re all in it together, but we’re not all equally responsible.

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt (AP) — Ugandan climate activist Vanessa Nakate slammed world leaders Tuesday who persist in backing new fossil fuel projects as other activists held a symbolic human and environmental rights protest and called for financing for vulnerable nations suffering devastating impacts of climate change.

Countries agreed in the 2015 Paris climate accord to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) by the end of the century if possible. But scientists say that with about 1.2 Celsius (21. Fahrenheit) of warming already reached, that target is likely to be missed, pushing temperatures to dangerous highs.

“The focus for many leaders is about making deals for fossil fuel lobbyists, surviving the next election cycle and grabbing as much short-term profit as possible,” Nakate said at an event on the sidelines of the U.N. climate talks in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt.

She warned that the annual meeting is being infiltrated by oil and gas representatives who are turning it into “a sales and marketing conference for more pollution and more destruction and more devastation.”

Environmental groups have counted more than 600 delegates with links to the fossil fuel industry at the two-week meeting.

Nakate cited research from the International Energy Agency stating that there can be no new investment in coal, oil or gas if the world is to stay below 1.5 C.

This was being undermined by massive public spending on fossil fuel subsidies, partly as a result of the fallout from Russia's attack on Ukraine which has triggered a scramble for alternative sources of oil and gas.

“You are sowing the wind and frontline communities are reaping the whirlwind,” she said. “You are sowing seeds of coal, oil and gas while frontline communities are reaping havoc, devastation and destruction.”

Many developing nations are disproportionately impacted by climate change as they are less able to adapt to extreme weather exacerbated by global warming.

Nakate called out those countries that have issued new licenses for oil and gas exploitation in their territorial waters, or promised investments in new fossil fuel infrastructure in Africa.

Jochen Flasbarth, a long-time German climate negotiator, said Nakate was right to highlight the urgency of tackling climate change but questioned her criticism of politicians concerned about elections.

“You might be right that politicians sometimes have a short-term view, but (you should) still make the best out of these elections,” he said, adding that “it is young people who increasingly did not go to elections over the last ten years” in many democratic nations.

Flasbarth told Nakate that young people “need to collaborate” with democratic processes to help “strengthen democracy around the world.”

Later Tuesday, a handful of climate activists gathered outside the conference venue in a symbolic protest to highlight what they said was restrictions and clampdowns on environmental and human rights defenders.

Organized by the Fridays for Future Movement, the brief demonstration took place in the official designated protest area amid tight security. Organizers said they received the required permission from the Egyptian authorities, but they declined to speak to media at the protest venue saying they didn't want to legitimize it.

They said the symbolic protest aimed to showcase “restrictions on civil society and protest” at this year's conference.

""We are protesting on behalf of and in solidarity with all those who can’t raise their voices, we are here demanding the liberation of those who have been silenced,” said activist Luisa Neubauer in a speech.

Protests at this year's conference have so far been broadly limited to the ‘Blue Zone,’ which is considered a U.N. territory.

Drought Map Track water shortages and restrictions across Bay Area Updated to include drought zones while tracking water shortage status of your area, plus reservoir levels and a list of restrictions for the Bay Area’s largest water districts.

Climate activists have repeatedly complained that restrictions and costly accommodation has discouraged large protests this year, in a stark contrast to previous years that featured large demonstrations. Last year's COP26 in Glasgow in Scotland, saw some 100,000 people marching through the streets in one rally and protesters frequently gathered in public squares and parks.

Street protests are virtually banned in Egypt, but the government set up a designated area outside the negotiating venue for demonstrations.

Activists also called for the establishment of a new body to be in charge of climate-related loss and damage for developing funding for nations vulnerable to global warming.

The demonstrations come as negotiators at the conference haggle over numerous thorny issues including increasing efforts to cut greenhouse gases and providing more financial help to poor nations.

Ministers began arriving in Sharm el-Sheikh on Monday to provide a push for the meeting to clinch a substantial deal by its schedule close on Friday.

0d9818de-1ace-4a8a-915d-f1c5b7f7b7f9,"Summary Portugal joins Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance

Fossil fuel finance pledge struggles for new members

Energy crisis puts focus on short-term fuel supplies















SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov 16 (Reuters) - An alliance committed to banning new domestic oil and gas drilling added Portugal as a member at the COP27 climate talks on Wednesday, but big fossil fuel producers stayed away as the world reels from energy turmoil caused by the Ukraine war.

The Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA) presents itself as a club of first movers to phase out the production of oil and gas in line with targets to avert severe climate change, although none of its members has significant production.

Apart from Portugal, it includes Costa Rica, Denmark, France, Ireland, Sweden and Wales, plus Greenland, Washington State and the Canadian province Quebec.

Denmark, leader of the group, acknowledged a renewed focus on energy security this year, as disruption caused by major oil and gas producer Russia's invasion of Ukraine has seen countries racing to buy non-Russian gas and in some cases burning more coal to replace plummeting Russian gas deliveries.

""Over the past year, our climate leadership has been tested in many ways,"" said Dan Jorgensen, acting climate and energy minister for Denmark.

""We are not calling for any sudden disruption of energy supplies, but we must equally recognise that the energy crisis is driven by the dependency on fossil fuels,"" he said.

The alliance said it will also start providing analysis and advice to developing countries on policies to move away from fossil fuel production, setting aside $10 million in funding to do so.

The International Energy Agency has said no new oil and gas fields should be developed if the world is to limit global warming to 1.5 Celsius and avoid its worst impacts.

Another alliance designed to limit fossil fuel support has struggled to expand this year.

Nearly 40 countries including the United States, Canada and Germany at last year's COP26 climate summit committed to stop public financing for fossil fuel projects abroad by the end of 2022.

Countries involved have since attempted to win support from Norway and Australia - so far, without success, although both are discussing the idea.

An event held at the COP27 summit on Tuesday announced one new member - Nepal.

""It's been really frustrating,"" a UK official told Reuters, of efforts to recruit more members to the group, asking not to be named.

Since signing the pledge last year, Denmark, Finland, France and Sweden joined Britain in fixing the commitment into their domestic policies - which the official said was hard-won progress given the context of energy supply concerns.

""We haven't seen real backsliding, across the board. They are still all pushing ahead,"" they said.

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt (Reuters) -China climate envoy Xie Zhenhua said on Monday that Beijing would like a COP27 deal that contains language similar to last year's agreement in Glasgow on targets for limiting global warming, and was not opposed to mentioning 1.5 degree Celsius.

""Last year’s Glasgow decision already clearly says it, we should follow the Paris Agreement and Glasgow,"" Xie said.

U.S. Special Envoy John Kerry had said late last week that a few countries at summit had resisted mentioning the 1.5C target in the official text of COP27, but didn't name them.

China is the world's top greenhouse gas emitter.

Countries at last year's climate summit in Scotland had reaffirmed the ambition set in the 2015 Paris Agreement to halt warming at less than 2C above pre-industrial times, as well as its aim for 1.5C as a better outcome.

The final text of the Glasgow pact also went a step further to elaborate on the benefits of halting warming at 1.5C, and the UK hosts touted the deal as one that would keep the 1.5C goal alive.

Scientists say crossing the 1.5C threshold risks bringing on the worst effects of climate change, and that the world will blow past it without more ambitious cuts to emissions.

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt (AP) — U.S. climate envoy John Kerry indicated on Tuesday he'll hold talks with his Chinese counterpart at annual United Nations climate talks underway in Egypt, in the latest sign of improving relations between the world's top two polluters after a meeting between their leaders Monday.

When asked if he would be meeting with China’s top climate official Xie Zhenhua on Tuesday, Kerry told The Associated Press that “I will meet with him sometime later,” without being more specific. “We’re able to talk, we'll see what happens,” he said.

Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed a day earlier to resume climate change talks with the United States. Xi had put those contacts on hold three months earlier in retaliation for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s trip to Taiwan.

Government ministers, who’ve been arriving in Sharm el-Sheikh since Monday, delivered impassioned speeches to delegates as they push for the meeting to clinch a substantial deal by Friday.

The prime minister of Samoa appealed Tuesday to countries to respond as strongly to the threat of global warming as they did to the coronavirus pandemic.

Fiamē Naomi Mataʻafa said her country and other Pacific states are “at the mercy of climate change and our survival hangs in the rush of the climate hourglass.” She praised those major emitters who have made commitments to sharply cut their greenhouse gas emissions, but said those are still too few.

“Why is it not possible to apply the same level of urgency of action witnessed for the COVID-19 pandemic to the meeting of the 1.5 degree Celsius promise?,” she asked.

She also called for more financial support to vulnerable countries, including the creation of a dedicated fund for “loss and damage” suffered as a result of climate change. She said failure to keep past funding promises had caused distrust.

“We cannot afford the further erosion of trust between the developed and developing countries,” she said.

The European Union is raising its target for cutting greenhouse gas emissions, albeit slightly, the 27-nation bloc’s top climate official told delegates.

Frans Timmermans said the EU will increase its target for reducing emissions by 2030 to 57%, from 55% previously, compared with 1990 levels. He said the increase showed the EU was not “backtracking” on its commitments because of the energy crisis sparked by Russia’s war in Ukraine.

“Europe is staying the course,” he said. “Actually, we’re even accelerating.”

Addressing poor nations who have called for more financial support to cope with global warming, Timmermans said the EU wants to work with multilateral banks “to get the shift of the trillions going.”

The bloc was also willing to address demands for “loss and damage” money “including new funding arrangements,” he said, but indicated that this would take time.

Environmental groups compared the EU’s increased target to breadcrumbs, saying the bloc’s fair share should be cuts of at least 65% by 2030.

“This small increase announced today at COP27 doesn’t do justice to the calls from the most vulnerable countries at the frontlines. If the EU, with a heavy history of emitting greenhouse gases, doesn’t lead on mitigating climate change, who will?” said Chiara Martinelli of Climate Action Network Europe.

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt (AP) — U.S. climate envoy John Kerry met Tuesday with his Chinese counterpart at annual United Nations climate negotiations in Egypt in a further hint of improving relations between the world's top two polluters, seen as vital for substantial progress against global warming.

The meeting between Kerry and China's top climate official Xie Zhenhua raised prospects for a full-fledged resumption of climate talks between the two countries, which Beijing put on hold three months ago in retaliation for U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s trip to Taiwan.

Kerry and Xie met for about 45 minutes at the Chinese delegation’s offices in the COP27 conference zone. Neither side revealed much after it was over. The Chinese officials left without commenting.

“We had a very good meeting,” Kerry said. It was “much too early” to talk about any remaining differences, he said. “But we’re gonna go to work.” A day earlier, Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed with U.S. President Joe Biden to resume the talks.

Other geopolitical tensions flared up. A handful of European Union delegates walked out of a plenary speech by Russia's special climate representative, Ruslan Edelgeriev, and a small group of Ukrainian and Polish activists briefly disrupted a Russian side event.

“They are killing us daily and they are here in the heart of international talks. They are accepted like normal people, but they are not,"" activist Svitlana Romanko shouted at the event as she was led away by security.

Government ministers are pushing for a substantial climate deal by the time the meeting is supposed to wrap up on Friday. Officials from developing nations, meanwhile, have been increasingly lashing out in anger and frustration at wealthy countries at the gathering, known as COP27, condemning them for not doing enough to cut back emissions or help them cope with a warming Earth.

The Associated Press obtained a first draft of the overarching decision proposed by Egypt, which touches on many of the points that delegations say are important to them, including reducing emissions, adapting to climate change, providing funding for poor nations suffering loss and damage caused by extreme weather, and sticking to the limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming.

It doesn't explicitly mention a proposal from India calling for a phase down of fossil fuel use, disappointing green groups. Last year’s Conference of the Parties, or COP, ended with a call to phase down coal.

“While this is merely a skeleton of the Egyptian presidency’s draft of a COP cover note, Greenpeace is shocked that it has no backbone,” the environmental group said in a statement.

EU climate chief Frans Timmermans said the bloc’s position is that “obviously we’re all in favor of phasing down any fossil fuels” but this shouldn't undermine the goal of ending use of coal, the most polluting fossil fuel.

Egyptian diplomat Wael Aboulmagd, speaking for the chair of the meeting, said a more detailed draft of the so-called cover decision would be circulated following consultations with delegations later Tuesday. He didn't rule out a call to end fossil fuel use in the final text.

Another major sticking point has been the issue of “loss and damage,” with developing countries demanding richer industrialized nations — whose emissions have been the main cause of climate change — pay for damages already being wreaked on them by climate-related disasters.

China and a broad group of developing countries known as the G77 put forward a proposal to create a such a fund into which developing nations would pay. The draft proposal, seen by The Associated Press, calls for the fund's rules to be finalized by the next U.N. climate talks in 2024.

The U.S. and other developed countries have made clear they won’t agree to a fund that implies legal liability for climate change.

A string of officials from poorer countries — particularly island nations — expressed their fury at the reluctance in speeches or in remarks to journalists Tuesday.

Delaying tactics anger “people like ourselves who are at the frontline, in the front of the impact of climate change and sea level rise, when in fact we do not cause climate change,” Seve Paeniu, the head of the Pacific island nation of Tuvalu's delegation, told the Associated Press.

The ambassador of Antigua and Barbuda to the U.N. said his nation won’t leave the summit without the establishment of a “loss and damage” fund, and he slammed developed nations for continuing to use or even ramping up fossil fuels.

“The system is being gamed at our expense ... and the expense of future generations,” Conrod Hunte said, denouncing ""the inaction of many developed countries.""

The climate change minister of Nauru, another Pacific nation, denounced what he called pressure on vulnerable countries to compromise.

""We have allowed ourselves to become props in environmental campaigns,” Rennier Gadabu said, in one of the more powerful speeches to delegates.

“The decision makers, those with real powers, simply do not care,” Gadabu said. “They do not care about the communities that will be displaced and destroyed. They do not care about the food and water shortages that ravage poor countries. All they care about is power, pure and simple.”

Samoa's prime minister appealed to countries to respond as strongly to the threat of global warming as they did to the coronavirus pandemic.

Fiamē Naomi Mataʻafa said her country and other Pacific states are “at the mercy of climate change and our survival hangs in the rush of the climate hourglass.”

Timmermans said the EU is willing to address demands for “loss and damage” money “including new funding arrangements,” he said, but indicated this would take time.

There were also some pledges for improved greenhouse gas emissions reductions targets, which didn't satisfy green groups.

Timmermans said the EU is raising its target for emissions reductions by 2030, albeit slightly to 57%, from the existing 55% pledge, compared with 1990 levels. He said the increase showed the EU was not “backtracking” on its commitments because of the energy crisis sparked by Russia’s war in Ukraine.

Environmental groups compared the EU’s increased target to breadcrumbs, saying a fair share should be at least 65% by 2030.

Turkey’s environment minister Murat Kurum, meanwhile, said its target is rising to 41% from the existing 21% goal. Green groups said while the numbers look good that’s because Turkey had been proposing to raise its emissions by a third in the same time frame, so the higher amount would need a bigger cut.

Also Tuesday, Ugandan climate activist Vanessa Nakate slammed world leaders who persist in backing new fossil fuel projects despite science warnings that this will push temperatures across the planet to dangerous highs.

19513cc9-2db5-42a7-a168-70e26ca8ca5d,"Rich nations have stuck to pledges to phase-out coal power despite the war in Ukraine to help reach their climate targets but expansion of China's coal fleet risks counteracting the impact of the closures.

Countries within the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) policy forum and the European Union are on track to close more than 75 per cent of their coal power capacity from 2010 to 2030, a report by the Powering Past Coal Alliance (PPCA) said.

Greenhouse gas emissions from burning coal are the single biggest contributor to climate change and weaning the world off coal is considered vital to achieving global climate targets.

The report, released on Tuesday to coincide with the COP27 climate summit of world leaders in Egypt, said while some countries such as Britain and Germany have delayed the closure of coal plants this winter due to the war in Ukraine and concerns over Russian energy supply, overall phase-out dates remained intact.

""Instead, governments are increasing their efforts to invest in renewables and increase energy efficiency in order to accelerate the transition away from power generation fuelled by both coal and gas,"" said the PPCA, an international campaign aimed at phasing out the fuel.

China has pledged to bring the country's carbon emissions to a peak by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.

On Monday, China said it did not oppose mentioning 1.5C as a goal for limiting global warming.

Last week, China's climate envoy Xei Zhenhua told the COP27 climate talks the country would need to retain some coal plants to help maintain the stability of its power grid.

There are still plans for almost 300 gigawatts (GW) of new coal power capacity globally with about two-thirds of this, or 197GW, slated to be built in China, the report showed.

""Accelerated retirements within the OECD and the collapse in the scale of new project proposals in the rest of the world have been counteracted by the ongoing expansion of the coal fleet in China,"" the report said.

The PPCA said many of these proposed projects could eventually be cancelled."
965c25c7-e832-4bbe-9a46-b0d3fe3bd226,"November 15 2022 marks a milestone for our species, as the global population hits 8 billion. Just 70 years ago, within a human lifetime, there were only 2.5 billion of us. In AD1, fewer than one-third of a billion. So how have we been so successful?

Humans are not especially fast, strong or agile. Our senses are rather poor, even in comparison to domestic livestock and pets. Instead, large brains and the complex social structures they underpin are the secrets of our success. They have allowed us to change the rules of the evolutionary game that governs the fate of most species, enabling us to shape the environment in our favour.

But there have been many unintended consequences, and now we have raised the stakes so high that human-driven climate change has put millions of species at risk of extinction.

Understanding population growth

Legend has it the king of Chemakasherri, which is in modern day India, loved to play chess and challenged a travelling priest to a game. The king asked him what prize he would like if he won. The priest only wanted some rice. But this rice had to be counted in a precise way, with a single grain on the first square of the board, two on the second, four on the third, and so on. This seemed reasonable, and the wager was set.

When the king lost, he told his servants to reward his guest as agreed. The first row of eight squares held 255 grains, but by the end of the third row, there were over 16.7 million grains. The king offered any other prize instead: even half his kingdom. To reach the last square he would need 18 quintillion grains of rice. That’s about 210 billion tonnes.

The king learned about exponential growth the hard way.

In the beginning

Our genus – Homo – had modest beginnings at square one around 2.3 million years ago. We originated in tiny, fragmented populations along the east African rift valley. Genetic and fossil evidence suggests Homo sapiens and our cousins the Neanderthals evolved from a common ancestor, possibly Homo heidelbergensis . Homo heidelbergensis had a brain slightly smaller than modern humans. Neanderthals had larger brains than us, but the regions devoted to thinking and social interactions were less well developed.

When Homo heidelbergensis started travelling more widely, populations started to change from one another. The African lineage led to Homo sapiens, while migration into Europe around 500,000 years ago created the Neanderthals and Denisovans.

Scientists debate the extent to which later migrations of Homo sapiens out of Africa (between 200,000 and 60,000 years ago) displaced the Neanderthals or interbred with them. Modern humans who live outside Africa typically have around 2% Neanderthal DNA. It is close to zero in people from African backgrounds.

If unchecked, all populations with more births than deaths grow exponentially. Our population does not double in each generation because the average number of children per couple is fewer than four. However, the pace of growth has been accelerating at an unprecedented rate. Those of us alive today are 7% of all the humans who ever existed since the origin of our species.

Why aren’t all species booming?

Biological intervention normally puts the brakes on population growth. Predator populations increase as their prey becomes more abundant, keeping numbers in check. Viruses and other disease agents sweep through populations and decimate them. Habitats become overcrowded. Or rapidly changing environments can turn the tables on once successful species and groups.

Charles Darwin, like the 18th-century scholar Thomas Malthus before him, thought there might be a hard limit on human numbers. Malthus believed our growing population would eventually outpace our ability to produce food, leading to mass starvation. But he did not foresee 19th and 20th-century revolutions in agriculture and transport, or 21st-century advances in genetic technology that allowed us to keep making more food, however patchily, across the globe.

Our intelligence and ability to make tools and develop technologies helped us survive most of the threats our ancestors faced. Within about 8,500 years humans went from the first metal tools to AI and space exploration.

The catch

We are now kicking an increasingly heavy can down the road. The UN estimates that by 2050 there will be nearly 10 billion of us. One consequence of these vast numbers is that small changes in our behaviour can have huge effects on climate and habitats across the globe. The rising energy demands of each person today are on average twice what they were in 1900.

But what of our cousins, the Neanderthals? It turns out, in one sense, their fate was less dire than we might suppose. One measure of evolutionary success is the number of copies of your DNA that are dispersed. By this measure Neanderthals are more successful today than ever. When Neanderthal populations were last distinct from Homo sapiens (around 40,000 years ago) there were fewer than 150,000 of them. Even assuming a conservative average of 1% Neanderthal DNA in modern humans, there is at least 500 times as much in circulation today than at the time of their “extinction”."
da71df7b-18fe-4ebc-b6f7-d53d204219e1,"India will surpass China as the country with the world’s largest population in 2023, according to the United Nations World Population Prospects 2022 report.

The UN also projects the global population has reached eight billion as of Tuesday.

As early as March 2022, reports circulated on Chinese social media that India’s population had already surpassed China’s, though this was later dispelled by experts.

Women in India today are having fewer children than their mothers had. But despite a lower fertility rate, the country’s population is still growing.

The idea the country should adopt something like China’s former “one-child policy” has been moving from the fringe to the political mainstream.

But the notion that India should emulate China’s past population policies is misguided at best, and dangerous at worst.

Both countries are struggling with the legacy of harsh population policies, and stricter population controls in India could have disastrous consequences for women and minority communities.

Given Australia’s growing ties to India, it should be concerned about what population policy could mean for the erosion of democratic norms in India.

Unintended consequences

India implemented the world’s first national family planning program in 1952. The birthrate began to drop, but only gradually, and family sizes remained stubbornly high. The government then implemented widespread forced sterilisation particularly of Muslims and the urban poor, especially during “The Emergency” years of 1975-77.

After the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, infant mortality dropped significantly. Between 1950 and 1980, China’s population almost doubled. The “one-child policy” – limiting births per couple through coercive measures – was implemented in the early 1980s, and fertility dropped dramatically.

In both India and China, these population policies had unintended consequences.

In China, the government found that once fertility rates dropped, they were faced with an ageing population. Even after relaxing birth control policies to allow all couples to have two children in 2015, and three children in 2021, birth rates remain low, particularly among the urban middle class favoured by the government.

In both countries, skewed sex ratios caused by sex selective abortions have led to a range of social problems, including forced marriages and human trafficking.

China has found that despite reversing course, it cannot undo this rapid demographic transition. Urban, middle-class couples face mounting financial pressure, including the cost of raising children and of caring for the elderly. While the government has encouraged “high quality” urban women to give birth, rural and minority women are still discouraged from having more children.

As in China, in some states in India, women’s education and their aspirations for their children have contributed to lower birth rates. Like China, these states now face an ageing population. Birth rates in other states with high Muslim populations have also declined, but at a slower rate.

Unfair impact

Despite declining birth rates, some politicians have advocated for the adoption of something like China’s former one-child policy in northern states with large Muslim populations. These calls have less to do with demographic reality, and more to do with majoritarian Hindu nationalist concerns around Muslim and “lower-caste” fertility.

The worry here is that the coming population milestone will push India to adopt knee-jerk population policies. These could in turn unfairly affect women and minorities.

Four Indian states with large Muslim populations have already passed versions of a “two-child policy”. What’s more, built into many of these policies are incentives for families to have just one child. And in 2021, a senior government minister proposed a national “one-child” policy.

Like past population control policies, they’re targeted at Muslim and lower-caste families, and illustrate a broader Hindu nationalist agenda with anti-democratic tendencies.

As happened at the height of China’s one-child policy, Indians could lose government jobs and more if such laws were passed at the national level. Some Indian states and municipalities have already legislated that people with more than two children are ineligible for government jobs and to stand for political office.

The irony is that India’s birth rate and the size of families are decreasing because of women’s own reproductive choices. Many women are getting surgical contraception after having two children (or after having a son).

However, financial inducements for doctors and the women means poorer women are pressured to undergo these procedures.

In other words, the trend in India is towards smaller families already. As the 2022 UN report itself notes, no drastic intervention from the state is required."
85f386e7-c6a0-41ce-992e-ffb15b4c4c25,"The world population has just hit a new record: 8 billion. As is often the case, there are heated debates about the planet’s so-called “carrying capacity” – the total number of people who can live on Earth sustainably. Experts are generally divided into two camps. There are those who argue that we need to drastically reduce the human population to avoid ecological catastrophe. And then there are those who believe that technology will find smart solutions without any need to actively tackle the issue head-on.

Scientists have been debating such demographic issues at least since the 18th century, when Thomas Malthus published An Essay on the Principle of Population, arguably the first global treatise on the relationship between population growth and scarcity. A few decades later, however, the Industrial Revolution (which the British economist had failed to anticipate) ushered the world into an era of abundance, relegating Malthus’s grim predictions about the inevitability of scarcity to the margins of scientific debate.

In a bestselling book published in the late 1960s, The Population Bomb, Stanford professor Paul Ehrlich brought the topic back, advocating for immediate action to limit population growth on a finite planet. This recommendation was reiterated a few years later by the Club of Rome, an international network of scientists and industrialists. Its 1972 report The Limits to Growth aptly demonstrated the dynamic relationship between increasing consumption and the idea of “planetary boundaries” which cannot be crossed without risking severe environmental change.

It’s true that some technologies have made production more efficient (think of fertilisers), thus alleviating the impact of population growth on resource use. But there is little doubt that the human race has massively overstepped the planetary boundaries, presently exceeding the safe operating space in six domains out of nine (see graphic above).

A smaller population could still be more destructive

It is difficult to estimate just how many humans the planet can carry sustainably, however. This is often overlooked in policy debates, which generally deal with the issue rather simplistically, resting on the assumption that increasing living standards will lead to lower birth rates. Therefore, the argument goes, the global population will decline as soon as continents like Asia and Africa reach similar development levels as Europe and North America

The fallacy here is to assume that only technology and population matter. These days environmental scientists generally agree that the overall impact is also a function of affluence (the so-called I=PAT equation). This can easily generate a paradox. Countries continue increasing their living standards by pushing up per-capita consumption, thus resulting in smaller populations but much bigger ecological impacts.

Take China. Its population growth rates have gone down significantly from 2.8% in the 1970s to the first decline in absolute terms this year. But in that period its overall consumption levels have increased enormously, resulting in a much worse net impact. The same applies to India and most emerging and developing economies. If this trend continues, we may end up with a smaller global population but significantly more destructive effects on the planet.

Developing a ‘wellbeing economy’

The time has come to rethink our approach to affluence and develop different ways to improve living standards. In a new report to the Club of Rome titled Earth4All, we argue that countries (especially the most industrialised) should replace the pursuit of economic growth with broader measures of social and ecological wellbeing. This would result in a significant decrease in material consumption, while not undermining overall quality of life.

What might this involve in practice? Policies should encourage better work-life balance and gender equality, as women’s empowerment is a key determinant of population growth. They should also optimise energy use and efficiency because the most renewable energy is what we do not need to use. We also need regenerative practices and homegrown solutions to manufacturing and food production (roughly 30% of food globally is either lost or wasted due to overconsumption and aesthetic standards).

Such a “wellbeing economy” approach would help all countries (including the poorest) leapfrog to a different type of development, able to combine high quality of life with very limited impacts on the environment. It is the difference between an extractive, linear economy that turns resources into emissions and a regenerative, circular economy that produces no waste because the output of any process becomes the input for another one.

There is massive room for improvement. After all, most of our wellbeing does not depend on material consumption (above a minimum sufficient level) but on the quality of our social relations and the environment in which we live. Ultimately, living better and more equitably will help us find the right balance also in terms of global population, without the need to impose restrictions."
2edea87f-af51-4252-bc34-4b7fab68b051,"😃 The Good: Societies are coming more sustainable

😔 The Bad: Not enough resources to support an ageing population

😡 The Ugly: Population can't survive on current food systems

The world ticked over a new milestone on Tuesday, reaching a population of 8 billion people.

The United Nations claims the unprecedented growth is due to the gradual increase in human lifespan as a result of improvements in public health, nutrition, personal hygiene and medicine.

With an increasing life expectancy, the United Nations predicts that rates will continue to climb, all though at a slower pace, until they peak at about 10.4 billion in the 2080s before beginning to decline.

But can the planet survive at such population levels? Take a look at the good, the bad and the ugly from the 8 billion milestone.

Societies are becoming more sustainable

A slow-down in the world's population growth is a sign that societies are becoming more sustainable, according to Associate Professor Tod Jones from Curtin University’s School of Design and the Built Environment. He told Yahoo News Australia this is a result of people’s choices.

The world's population was predicted to hit 8 billion on Tuesday, just 11 years after it reached 7 billion. Source: AAP

“As society has become more wealthy, and as women take more control over their fertility and have more independence,” he said, “instead of massively overshooting or ending up having a huge population that will be hard to sustain, we are actually seeing that population, really through the choices of people, become sustainable.""

With the United Nations predicting that the population will peak in 60 years’ time, Professor Jones says this will give countries time to plan for the future and prepare for issues surrounding an ageing population.

MORE GOOD

Not enough resources to support an ageing population

With an increasing life expectancy and expanding older demographic, Professor Jones says the balance of people in the workforce and those who are retired will tip, and that will place more pressure on resources.

Story continues

“We're going to have to move from being in a situation where there's increasing numbers of productive people who are working, to a state where we're going to have larger and larger numbers of older people who aren’t working, and they're going to need to be supported by those people who are working,” he said.

New figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics reveal that Australia’s life expectancy has jumped to the third-highest in the world, up from sixth place last year. A girl born in Australia today is expected to live to until 85.4 and a boy to 81.3.

“We are going to need to consider the amount of funding and resources required to look after older people,” Professor Jones said. “As people get older, because of bodies that wear out over time, there is going to be greater costs on the health system and greater demand for things like retirement homes, so that is the biggest risk.”

MORE BAD

Population can't survive on current food systems

As the world's population continues to amplify amid unprecedented impacts of climate change including extreme heat and flooding, experts warn that our food supply systems hang in a dangerous balance.

Economist Steve Keen, from the University of Western Sydney, told the ABC's The Business the human population at this size cannot survive.

“When you add up the mass of humans and the animals the humans breed to eat, compared to the mass of the rest of the animals on the planet, we are over 95 per cent of the mammal mass on this planet,"" he said. ""That is at eight billion and there is just no way we can keep on going at this rate without basically wiping out the life-support systems that we ourselves depend upon.""

cb121af1-3f02-4f36-ba6c-535918fef6f5,"The United Nations says the world’s population is projected to reach the eight billion mark on Tuesday.

The projection came in a UN report released in July, which said much of the growth expected between now and 2050 is coming from just eight countries.

Half of those are in sub-Saharan Africa: Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia and Tanzania. The UN said populations in that region are growing at 2.5 percent, more than three times the global average.

Still, experts said the bigger threat to the environment is consumption, which is highest in developed countries not undergoing big population increases. The report also said that India is expected to overtake China next year as the world’s most populous country.

The upward trend threatens to leave even more people in developing countries further behind, as governments struggle to provide enough classrooms and jobs for a rapidly growing number of youths, and food insecurity becomes an even more urgent problem.

It projected that the world’s population will reach approximately 8.5 billion in 2030, 9.7 billion in 2050 and 10.4 billion in 2100. Other countries rounding out the list with the fastest-growing populations are Egypt, Pakistan, the Philippines and India.

Rapid population growth also means more people vying for scarce water resources, and it leaves more families facing hunger as climate change increasingly affects crop production in many parts of the world.

The population growth in sub-Saharan Africa can be attributed to people living longer, but family size remains the driving factor. Women in sub-Saharan Africa on average have 4.6 births, twice the current global average of 2.3.

At the same time, a small portion of the world’s population uses most of the resources and produces most of the greenhouse-gas emissions, said Poonam Muttreja, executive director of the Population Foundation of India.

“Over the past 25 years, the richest 10 percent of the global population has been responsible for more than half of all carbon emissions,” Muttreja said.

Charles Kenny, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development in Washington, said environmental concerns surrounding the eight billion mark should focus on consumption, particularly in developed countries.

“Population is not the problem, the way we consume is the problem – let’s change our consumption patterns,” he said."
aa8ad223-5d49-49c4-97c4-2548cafe229e,"World’s Population Reaches 8 Billion People for the First Time — and That’s Fine!

Sometime today, November 15, the 8 billionth human on Earth is projected to be born. It could be happening right now, as I write this (or you read this). Or maybe it happened hours ago. But regardless of the exact second, today we officially enter a world with an estimated 8 billion people in it, according to a new report from the United Nations.

It’s the first time we’ve added a full billion people since 2011, when humanity reached the 7 billion mark. And things have slowed down from there. The rate of global population growth is at its lowest since 1950, at under 1% per year, where it’s been hovering since 2020.

As a species, we’re not expected to collect our next billion for another 15 years or so. By 2050, the UN forecasts a global population of about 9.7 billion. The intergovernmental organisation further projects that the number of humans on Earth will peak at about 10.4 billion during the 2080’s.

The reasons behind that slowed population growth and expected eventual peak are multifold. As so-called “sustainable development” benchmarks like birth control access, education access, and gender equality all improve, people gain more bodily autonomy and can choose how or if to have children. As people in more countries become more educated and societies become more equal, population trends tend to level out.

Fertility rates — meaning the number of births per woman on average, not the amount of fertile people — have fallen significantly for many countries. Two-thirds of the world population lives in a place where the lifetime rate is at or below 2.1 births per woman, which is the approximate rate for zero growth long-term, when mortality is low.

The UN report also noted other shifts as well. India is projected to become the single most populous country, surpassing China, in 2023. Up through 2050, future population increases are projected to come mostly from eight countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, the Philippines, and Tanzania. And global average life expectancy is estimated to reach 77.2 years in 2040, despite setbacks from the COVID-19 pandemic and persisting disparities.

On either side of discussions of human population, you will find extremists. But 8 billion people on Earth is far from the existential “overpopulation” crisis imagined by scientists, philosophers, sociologists, and others throughout modern history. In 1798, when there were just about 800 million people on the planet, Thomas Malthus published the essay “On the Principle of Population,” in which the economist predicted widespread famine without strictly imposed limits on human reproduction. And though it’s never materialised as prophesized, it’s an idea which has been oft repeated since — for instance, in Paul Erlich’s 1960 (population: 3 billion) book The Population Bomb, which also made sweeping forecasts about world hunger so incorrect, they had to be continually updated in new additions. Or in 2013’s Ten Billion, which assumes a nightmare scenario for people and the planet at, you guessed it, a population of 10 billion.

Yet so far, basically every projection of a limit to Earth’s human population, or assumed “ideal number” has been wrong.

Though in some places, people do experience famines, they are the result of wars or political and economic manoeuvres rather than any exceeded natural limit on food availability. Our capacity to feed ourselves has accelerated faster than our population has, and hunger is a problem of distribution and equity. We have many more people on earth than we did thousands, hundreds, and tens of years ago, yet average quality of life and life expectancy has increased (almost) unimpeded over that same time.

More people on the planet may mean more opportunities for conflicts with other species and the health of our environment, but declining biodiversity with increasing human numbers does not have to be a foregone conclusion. There are sustainable solutions out there for energy, agriculture, and how we build things. It’s just a matter of shifting perspectives, attitudes, and policies.

The number of people in a place is not the sole (or even primary) determiner of environmental impact. After all, Canada and Australia are among the countries with some of the lowest population densities on the planet — and yet, are #7 and #11 respectively on the list of counties with the largest per-capita carbon dioxide emissions. And an incredibly small number of people are most responsible for climate change.

On the flipside, those like Elon Musk who have feared total population collapse and the accompanying dissolution of society are also functioning under a weird, unfounded set of assumptions. Again, the UN predicts a gradual peak and levelling out of the human population. In some places, like Japan and parts of Europe there are already declines in national population, and there will continue to be. But that doesn’t mean everything falls apart. There are challenges to an ageing demographic, like coordinating care and health costs, but they are not insurmountable.

Of crossing the 8 billion threshold, UN secretary general António Guterres said, “This is an occasion to celebrate our diversity, recognise our common humanity, and marvel at advancements in health that have extended lifespans and dramatically reduced maternal and child mortality rates,” in a press release about the report. “At the same time,” he added, “it is a reminder of our shared responsibility to care for our planet and a moment to reflect on where we still fall short of our commitments to one another.”

Earth is an often wonderful, often extremely difficult place to eke out existence. Regardless of how your life is going, don’t blame the 8 billionth baby."

World leaders, scientists and policymakers are gathered in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, for the 27th United Nations Conference of the Parties (COP27) climate summit. So far, the discussions have addressed the urgent need to decarbonize high-emitting industries, adaptation strategies for climate-resilient agriculture and loss and damage compensation.

As the conference enters its second week, Nature spoke to four climate scientists from the host country about their research, the challenges they encounter and their hopes for COP27.

‘Enough promises’

Hany Mostafa, Environment and Climate Changes Research Institute, Egyptian National Water Research Centre, Cairo.

At my research institute, we work on projects to mitigate the sea-level rise in the Nile Delta, and study its impact on farmers and people living in the surrounding area.

Carbon emissions hit new high: warning from COP27

There is a lot of uncertainty in the field because of the diversity of climate models, and this makes it difficult to transform our research into feasible projects that can be put into immediate action. Using the computers we have access to, it can take three months to run one model, whereas high-performance computers can do it in one hour. The lack of supporting technologies causes delays in producing our research.

My colleagues are attending COP27 and delivering a presentation on the Water Day, 14 November. But we’re only doing research — we cannot change policies. We wish to hear about an agreement to reduce emissions by the end of COP27, and to see actions not just words. We have heard enough promises in previous COP meetings.

Filling the gaps in climate research

Mohamed Salem Nashwan, Arab Academy for Science, Technology, and Maritime Transport, Cairo.

In my research, I study regional climate change. Our models show that even in the optimistic scenario, in which countries commit to limiting global warming to between 1.5 °C and 2 °C, the mean temperature in Egypt will still increase by 1.3–1.5 °C by the end of the century. We will experience increases in winter rainfall, extreme precipitation and longer dry spells.

There is a huge gap in climate research in the Middle East and North Africa. Most of the studies focus on Europe, or the Mediterranean region. You wouldn’t find research specifically on Egypt, for example; the work that exists is like a by-product of research on the Mediterranean region or the African continent.

In developed countries, climate change is considered a top issue and people demonstrate about it in the streets. Here in Egypt, it’s not the main priority. We have several challenges, including economic and water-related problems, so environmental issues are not on top of the list. But Egypt hosting COP27 this year has made the climate crisis finally come to the surface. Although COP27 is mainly for policymakers, it will increase the national awareness of climate issues and will make our research more valuable. But I am afraid that by the end of COP27, things will return to the way they were before.

‘Our research proposes solutions’

Lamiaa Mahmoud, University of Florida, Gainsville, and Mansoura University, Egypt.

We are already aware that climate change is affecting many aspects of our lives, such as agricultural commodities, food security and public health.

My research focuses on finding strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change and sea-level rise in the Nile Valley. I collaborate with plant-breeding scientists at the University of Florida to find plant genotypes that can tolerate droughts and a high level of salinity.

The biggest challenge for me is knowing that although something can be done to prevent economic and agricultural losses, nothing can be done instantly. Applying the outcomes of climate studies is a long and exhausting process, and funding and potential profits are key factors.

Even though our research proposes solutions, I feel that it is not up to the scientists to translate the output of their studies into effective adaptation projects. So I hope that, with COP27, we can see immediate action to initiate the implementation of such projects before it’s too late.

Data issues

Aya Al-Sharqawy, chief executive and co-founder of Recyclizer, Cairo.

I was a speaker during a session on climate-change adaptation, loss and damage at COP27’s Youth and Future Generations Day (held on 10 November), and did a talk about my start-up in another session.

The company I co-founded, Recyclizer, collects plastic waste from the streets and recycles it into a mulch film that can be used to cover soil, protecting it from damage and reducing the amount of water needed for irrigation.

As COP27 kicks off, Egypt warns wealthy nations against ‘backsliding’

In my academic research, I focused on how the decision-making process in the public and private sectors affects the implementation of sustainability and development goals and tackling climate change in Egypt.

Lack of data or poor access to data has been my greatest challenge. Others include access to research papers in science journals — as a researcher in a developing country, paying fees to access multiple international journals is an issue.

I am hoping that the engagement of African and Egyptian youth in COP27 is going to increase social awareness of climate change, and put pressure on decision makers to include Egyptian and African initiatives in climate action."

Burning, drifting, and being devoured by insects, Canada’s Boreal forest is shrinking and climate change is to blame.

Second only to the South American Amazon forest, the Boreal forest is vital to ensuring the future of planet Earth, reports AFP. The forest which encircles the arctic and stretches across Canada, Scandinavia, Russia and Alaska has in recent times been weakened by forest fires, the melting of permafrost, an insect infestation, warming temperatures and drifting trees.

As per AFP experts have categorically warned that “the forest is encroaching on the tundra, and the prairies are slowly taking the place of the trees.”

With the rising temperatures “drunken trees” have become a common phenomenon; trees are tilted sideways due to the melting permafrost. Eventually, the soil will completely erode and the fauna will tumble down.

Edmonton-based researcher for the natural resources ministry warns ""You have the potential for large shifts,"" adding that some areas might be flooded and even lose forests, which can eventually turn into bogs or swamps, and lakes.

The degradation of permafrost is behind this “buckling and sinking”, ground which for the past two years has remained frozen is thawing.

With it, bacteria are eating away at the biomass collected over thousands of years, generating carbon, and methane emissions which are then contributing to the acceleration of global warming.

Data collected by Global Forest Watch, the World Resources Institute, and the University of Maryland also revealed that extreme heat waves are five times more likely today than 150 years ago.

The higher temperatures have also brought on another problem: insect infestations, which are quickly eating away at the trees.

Fauna, already weakened by the droughts brought on by heatwaves struggle to fend off bugs that exploit the longer summers and warmer winters.

Scientists as per AFP say that for now there’s still hope for the ecosystem's continued resilience, even as they ponder whether the forest’s “tipping point”, a threshold after which emissions will be inevitable and changes to the ecosystem irreversible is approaching.

PALMERSTON NORTH, New Zealand (AP) — How do you stop a cow from burping?

It might sound like the start of a humorous riddle, but it's the subject of a huge scientific inquiry in New Zealand. And the answer could have profound effects on the health of the planet.

More specifically, the question is how to stop cows, sheep and other farm animals from belching out so much methane, a gas which doesn't last as long as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere but is at least 25 times more potent when it comes to global warming.

Because cows can't readily digest the grass they eat, they ferment it first in multiple stomach compartments, or rumen, a process that releases huge amounts of gas. Every time somebody eats a beef burger or drinks a milkshake, it comes at an environmental cost.

New Zealand scientists are coming up with some surprising solutions that could put a big dent in those emissions. Among the more promising are selective breeding, genetically modified feed, methane inhibitors, and a potential game-changer — a vaccine.

Nothing is off the table, from feeding the animals more seaweed to giving them a kombucha-style probiotic called “Kowbucha.” One British company has even developed a wearable harness for cows that oxidizes methane as it's burped out.

In New Zealand, the research has taken on a new urgency. Because farming is central to the economy, about half of the nation's greenhouse gas emissions come from farms, compared to less than 10% in the U.S. New Zealand's 5 million people are outnumbered by 26 million sheep and 10 million cattle.

As part of a push to become carbon neutral, New Zealand's government has promised to reduce methane emissions from farm animals by up to 47% by 2050.

Last month the government announced a plan to begin taxing farmers for animal burps, a world-first move that has angered many farmers. All sides are hoping they might catch a break from science.

Much of the research is taking place at a Palmerston North campus, which some have jokingly taken to calling Gumboot Valley, in a nod to Silicon Valley.

“I don’t believe there’s any other place that has the breadth of ambition that New Zealand has in terms of the range of technologies being investigated in any one place,” said Peter Janssen, a principal scientist at AgResearch, a government-owned company that employs about 900 people.

Underpinning the research are studies indicating that reducing methane doesn't need to harm the animals or affect the quality of the milk or meat. Janssen said the microbes that live in the animals and produce methane seem to be opportunistic rather than integral to digestion.

He's been working on developing a vaccine for the past 15 years and has focused intensively on it for the past five years. He said it has the potential to reduce the amount of methane belched by cows by 30% or more.

“I certainly believe it’s going to work, because that’s the motivation for doing it,” he said.

A vaccine would stimulate an animal's immune system to produce antibodies, which would then dampen the output of the methane-producing microbes. One big upside of a vaccine is that it would likely only need to be administered once a year, or even perhaps even once in an animal's lifetime.

Working in a similar way, inhibitors are compounds administered to the animals that directly dampen the methane microbes.

Inhibitors could also reduce methane by at least 30% and perhaps by up to 90%, according to Janssen. The challenge is that the compounds need to be safe for animal consumption and not pass through the meat or milk to humans. Inhibitors must also be regularly administered.

Both inhibitors and vaccines are some years away from being market ready, Janssen said.

But other technologies such as selective breeding, which could reduce methane output by 15%, will be rolled out onto sheep farms as early as next year, Janssen said. A similar program for cows may not be too far behind.

Scientists have for years been testing sheep in chambers to chart differences in how much methane they belch. The low-emitters have been bred and produced low-emitting offspring. Scientists have also been tracking genetic characteristics common to low-emitting animals that make them readily identifiable.

“I think one of the areas that New Zealand scientists, particularly, have made some great progress is in this whole area of animal breeding,” said Sinead Leahy, the principal science advisor at the New Zealand Agricultural Greenhouse Gas Research Centre. “And particularly, a lot of research has been done into breeding low emissions sheep.”

Another target is the feed that animals eat, which scientists believe has the potential for reducing methane output by 20% to 30%.

At one greenhouse on the campus, scientists are developing genetically modified clover. Visitors must wear booties and medical scrubs and avoid putting down objects to prevent any cross-contamination.

The scientists explain that because New Zealand farm animals eat outside in fields most of the time rather than in barns, methane-reducing feed additives like Bovaer, developed by Dutch company DSM, aren't as useful.

Instead, they are looking to genetically modify the ryegrass and white clover that the New Zealand animals predominantly eat.

With the clover, scientists have found a way to increase tannins, which helps block methane production.

“What this team has done is they’ve actually identified, through their research, a master switch that switches on condensed tannins in the leaves,” said Linda Johnson, a science group manager at AgResearch.

Laboratory analysis indicates the modified clover reduces methane production by 15% to 19%, Johnson said.

The clover program goes hand-in-hand with a ryegrass program.

Richard Scott, an AgResearch senior scientist, said they have been able to increase the oil levels in ryegrass leaves by about 2%, which studies indicate should translate to a 10% drop in methane emissions.

But like the inhibitors and vaccine, the feed program is still some years away from being farm ready. Scientists have completed controlled tests in the U.S. and are planning a bigger field trial in Australia.

However, New Zealand has strict rules that ban most genetically modified crops, a regulatory barrier that the scientists will need to overcome if they are to introduce the modified feed to the nation's farms.

In other research, dairy company Fonterra is trialing its probiotic Kowbucha concoction and British company Zelp is continuing to trial and refine its wearable harnesses. Other trials have indicated that a red seaweed called Asparagopsis reduces methane when eaten by cows.

But farmers aren't waiting around for all the research to come to fruition. On the Kaiwaiwai Dairies farm near the town of Featherston, farmer Aidan Bichan said they've been reducing their methane output by getting more efficient.

He said that includes increasing the milk production from each cow, using less processed feed, and replacing milking cows less frequently.

“At a farm level, we’ve got to do our bit to help save the planet,” Bichan said."

Richard Scott, an AgResearch senior scientist, said they have been able to increase the oil levels in ryegrass leaves by about 2%, which studies indicate should translate to a 10% drop in methane emissions.

But like the inhibitors and vaccine, the feed program is still some years away from being farm ready. Scientists have completed controlled tests in the U.S. and are planning a bigger field trial in Australia.

However, New Zealand has strict rules that ban most genetically modified crops, a regulatory barrier that the scientists will need to overcome if they are to introduce the modified feed to the nation's farms.

In other research, dairy company Fonterra is trialing its probiotic Kowbucha concoction and British company Zelp is continuing to trial and refine its wearable harnesses. Other trials have indicated that a red seaweed called Asparagopsis reduces methane when eaten by cows.

But farmers aren't waiting around for all the research to come to fruition. On the Kaiwaiwai Dairies farm near the town of Featherston, farmer Aidan Bichan said they've been reducing their methane output by getting more efficient.

He said that includes increasing the milk production from each cow, using less processed feed, and replacing milking cows less frequently.

“At a farm level, we’ve got to do our bit to help save the planet,” Bichan said."

Architects of the ambitious 2015 Paris Agreement which deals with climate action have called for an equally ambitious agreement to protect the world's fauna and flora.

They want this agreement to be signed at an upcoming UN biodiversity meeting which will be held in Montreal next month.

As per AFP, dozens of countries will get together from December 7 to 19 to ""hammer out"" a new biodiversity framework to protect ""nature"" from destruction at the hands of humans. This comes as scientists warn that the world is facing a potential sixth mass extinction event.

Watch | Gravitas: Are we in another age of Mass extinction?

Climate leaders who helped get the 2015 Paris agreement 'over the line', on Wednesday released a letter in which they called for a high-reaching framework and said ""The world came together in 2015 to secure the Paris Agreement. We urge leaders to do the same now to deliver a strong sister agreement capable of securing a nature-positive world by 2030.""

The letter which was released during UN's COP27 climate talks includes Laurent Fabius, the former French foreign minister who oversaw the Paris Agreement, along with former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres and French climate envoy Laurence Tubiana, who assisted in the drafting of the 2015 pact.

Underscoring the ""entwined"" agendas of the climate and biodiversity crisis the world faces they said that the December conference ""offers an unprecedented opportunity for the world to turn the tide on nature loss"", which we ""cannot afford to miss"", adding that ""Bold leadership is required.""

They further said that COP27 ""must go further in recognising nature's fundamental role as part of the climate solution.""

Up till now, only two of the 22 frameworks of the so-called Post-2020 global biodiversity framework have been agreed on, and as per AFP, several sticking points are expected to divide the negotiations.

The framework aims to halt biodiversity loss by 2030 and achieve recovery by 2050. It also asks for a global commitment to lay aside at least 30 per cent of lands and oceans as protected zones by the end of this decade.

LONDON, Nov 16 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - At the U.N. COP27 climate change conference in Egypt, the architects of the Paris Agreement to curb global warming urged negotiators at the upcoming biodiversity summit in Canada to take ""urgent action"" to protect and restore nature.

They said that a failure to agree on an ""ambitious and transformative"" biodiversity pact at COP15 in Montreal in December would risk undermining key global climate goals.

The climate deal that is currently being thrashed out at COP27 should also recognise the role of nature, they added.

At 2015's climate meeting in Paris, countries agreed to cut emissions in order to keep global warming ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) and ideally to 1.5C (2.7F) - a limit that the world is now likely to surpass, scientists warn.

""Achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 is only possible if we also act now to deliver a nature-positive society,"" said a statement by the Paris Agreement architects.

Meanwhile, more than 300 civil society organisations have called for the agreement that will be negotiated at COP15 to reverse nature loss and ""secure a nature-positive world this decade"".

So what would a 'nature-positive' world entail, and how might countries achieve it?

WHY FOCUS ON RESTORING NATURE?

From deforestation to overfishing, global environmental destruction has reached a point where many plant and animal species will simply not recover.

The world's wildlife populations have declined by more than two-thirds since 1970, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) has found.

As well as preserving vital biodiversity, protecting nature has a significant impact on global climate goals.

Nature has absorbed 54% of human-related carbon dioxide emissions over the past decade, but the capacity of the world's forests, oceans and other ecosystems to do this is weakening, according to a newly-released WWF report.

https://wwfint.awsassets.panda.org/downloads/wwf_our_climates_secret_ally_uncovering_the_story_of_nature_in_the_ipcc_ar6.pdf

WHAT DOES 'NATURE-POSITIVE' MEAN?

In simple terms, achieving a 'nature-positive' world involves halting and reversing current trends of ecological destruction, which conservationists say needs to be achieved by the end of the decade.

""The idea (is) that there should be more nature in 2030 than 2020,"" explained Gavin Edwards, director of the Global Nature Positive Initiative at WWF.

He said this 'nature-positive' goal could be the equivalent of the 1.5C pledge, providing a sense of direction for the movement: where emissions cuts are needed to curb rising temperatures, nature protection is needed to boost biodiversity.

""Essentially, that curve has to be bent up at the same time as the climate curve is being bent down,"" Edwards added.

HOW CAN COUNTRIES MEASURE 'NATURE POSITIVE'?

'Nature-positive' outcomes entail the protection and restoration of natural processes, ecosystems and species, according to conservation organisations.

https://f.hubspotusercontent20.net/hubfs/4783129/NDNP/PDFs/Measuring%20Nature%20Positive%20Goal_Final_2022.pdf

This can be quantified by measuring metrics like tree cover, the integrity of habitats, and the number of species.

The exact details will differ from country to country, said Edwards.

He said countries can be held accountable to their nature protection goals in a similar way to the ""ratchet"" mechanism of the Paris climate agreement - where national commitments are updated following a global stocktake on progress.

""It dictates where we need to go collectively, and a process of accountability to help us get there,"" Edwards explained.

WILL THERE BE A BREAKTHROUGH ON NATURE?

About 112 nations have backed a goal - to be discussed at COP15 in Montreal - to protect 30% of the planet's land and oceans by 2030.

Despite this, the U.N. head of biodiversity, Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, has said that COP15 is not expecting national leaders to attend the event next month.

This comes after several previous negotiations on the pact have stalled, leaving a huge task facing delegates in Montreal.

""Paris was a seminal moment where the ambition needed to address the climate crisis was finally acknowledged and nations acted,"" said Jennifer Morris, chief executive of environmental organisation The Nature Conservancy.

""This December in Montreal, we could have that same type of moment for biodiversity,"" she said.

b817b5c2-473f-4cc4-9765-23cdc0567384,"The outcome of Cop27 will be crucial not just in terms of tackling the climate crisis but to help ensure a future for nature, the UN’s head of biodiversity has said, outlining plans for “a Paris moment for biodiversity” at Cop15 in Montreal in December.

“Clearly the world is crying out for change, watching as governments seek to heal our relationships with nature, with the climate,” said Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, executive secretary of the convention on biological diversity (CBD), at a media briefing on Thursday. “Scientists have told us in no uncertain terms … that climate change and biodiversity loss are intrinsically connected and that’s why we are looking at the [Cop15] framework as, basically, a Paris moment for biodiversity.”

In Paris in 2015, governments agreed legally binding targets to limit global temperature rises for the first time, pledging to hold global heating to well below 2C, with an aspiration not to breach 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.

At the Cop15 summit in December, organised by China but hosted in Canada, governments are expected to agree a UN agreement to halt the destruction of the natural world. Top officials have warned the nature agreement – the UN CBD – depends on strong climate commitments.

“We’re seeing more and more biodiversity agenda appearing in the discussions under the climate Cop,” Mrema said. “The outcomes from Cop27 will be instrumental, and will influence a lot the discussions and specific targets under the framework.”

David Cooper, deputy executive secretary of the CBD, said the climate crisis is one of the main drivers of biodiversity decline. “If we don’t have successful outcomes in the climate process, then we cannot hold and reverse biodiversity loss … we depend on the success of the climate conference, but they also depend on the success of the biodiversity conference,” he said.

Heads of states or government are not expected to attend Cop15, Mrema said. This confirms reports last month that China did not invite world leaders, with suggestions Beijing was downplaying the crucial meeting in order not to embarrass the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, whose presence is not anticipated at the conference.

Many have raised concerns that the absence of world leaders will lessen the importance of Cop15, which already clashes with the World Cup. But Mrema said: “I think we need to be optimistic. I’m not worried at all. The leaders have made their commitments. We need them to really guide and instruct their negotiators to come to Montreal with an open mind, ready to arrive at consensus.”

Twenty-one targets are being negotiated, including protecting 30% of land and sea by 2030, reducing the rate of introduction of invasive species by half, reducing pesticides by two-thirds and eliminating plastic waste.

Other draft targets include getting businesses to look at and report on their impacts on biodiversity and create a framework to reduce those impacts. There are also plans to increase money spent protecting biodiversity – from all sources public and private – to at least $200bn a year, and redirect environmentally damaging agricultural subsidies.

The world negotiates biodiversity targets once a decade and governments will agree them for the 2020s at Cop15 in December after more than two years of pandemic-related delays.

Earlier this year the V20 – a grouping of poor countries most vulnerable to climate change – estimated that the costs to its members of the climate crisis had already surpassed US$500 billion. It called for the establishment of an international “loss and damage” fund, paid for by the “rich, powerful and climate change-responsible nations”. Initial proposals for financing the fund included a global carbon tax, taxes on airline travel, windfall taxes on fossil fuel producers, or taxes on financial transactions.

The response, favoured by most rich countries, has been to instead promote the development of new insurance schemes protecting against climate damages. Germany has led the way and formally launched with the V20 and G7 an insurance-based “Global Shield against Climate Risks” on November 14.

Details are still emerging. However, Global Shield looks to have walked back the more expressly redistributive proposals initially advanced by the V20. It is also significantly more restrictive than proposals for a global “Loss and Damage” fund advanced by China and the G77 bloc of developing countries.

The major thrust of Global Shield is to increase “pre-arranged” finance “which disburses quickly and reliably before or just after disasters happen”. It aims to do this by supporting the development of a range of different insurance instruments at household, business and national level.

Initial funding comes mostly from Germany, which has pledged €170 million, with smaller pledges from Canada, Denmark, France and Ireland. The G20, World Bank and V20 have all pledged to help with its administration.

Global Shield is far from the first experiment with insurance as a response to the increasing prevalence of climate hazards. There are important reasons, highlighted extensively by previous research, to be very cautious about the limits of insurance as a climate response. Two particular problems will be very difficult for Global Shield to surmount: who pays? And which risks can be covered?

Who pays?

The first problem is who pays for insurance coverage. This is an ethical problem: should the people and countries who’ve contributed least to greenhouse gas emissions pay the cost of the associated damages? But it’s also a pragmatic limit encountered by most previous insurance schemes for climate risks.

For the past quarter century, the World Bank and other institutions have promoted household- and business-level insurance schemes for the poorest as a response to climate risks. In practice, these schemes have often proved too expensive for poor people to sign up to. Existing schemes remain heavily reliant on public subsidies.

National-scale insurance faces similar problems. For instance, the African Risk Capacity (ARC), a famine-relief scheme launched in 2014 by the African Union, has never managed to enrol more than 13 of 54 eligible countries.

It’s not clear yet who will pay for insurance under Global Shield. Judging by the size of the financial commitments announced thus far, it seems fair to say that major donors don’t intend to pay for all of it.

But some form of premium support from donors will be a condition for Global Shield to get off the ground. This is especially true given the escalating debt burdens currently faced by many developing countries. Yet, even with premiums partially subsidised by donors, the experience of the African Risk Capacity and of individual- and household-level schemes over the last couple of decades isn’t promising.

Equally, it’s unclear whether poor people and countries should have to pay at all. Asking the people who’ve contributed least to global carbon emissions to pay for protection from the effects of those emissions is precisely the inverse of most visions of climate justice.

Protection from what risks?

By definition, insurance is designed to protect against singular harmful events which must be relatively rare. Global Shield is clearly designed with such catastrophes in mind – things like flooding, storms and severe droughts.

It is highly questionable whether this “rarity” condition will be met, given the increasing frequency of natural disasters. As Harjeet Singh of the Climate Action Network pointed out: “If I get into car accidents every other day, I will be blacklisted by the company.”

Equally, it can be difficult to determine if weather events are severe enough to trigger a payout. This is even harder when funds are meant to be disbursed in advance or very quickly – as Global Shield aims to do. There’s a risk that countries or people buy insurance, but then find that it doesn’t cover the precise disaster they’re faced with.

For instance, in 2016 a severe drought in Malawi caused a famine, but failed to trigger a payout from ARC. The scheme used a predictive model which underestimated the extent of likely damage. Eventually, adjustments were made and US$8 million paid to Malawi. But this happened months too late, and made no more than a small dent in the estimated US$395 million in damages caused by the drought.

There’s another problem. Insurance, by definition, can only offer cover against specific events. It is very little help with, say, the gradual erosion of the ecological conditions suitable for producing key crops. This is arguably the main form in which the most vulnerable people experience climate damage.

Recent research on rice farmers in Cambodia, for instance, has shown many farmers trapped in a spiral of escalating indebtedness linked to climate change. Unpredictable rainfall had led to growing reliance on costly fertilisers and pesticides, as well as exposure to increasingly frequent crop failures.

Campaigners have already described Global Shield as “cynical” and a “distraction” from meaningful efforts to fund loss and damage. Whatever the motivations of the German government and its other supporters, the track record of various initiatives aimed at using insurance to address climate risks should give us pause.

We have to meaningfully address the escalating loss and damage already underway due to climate change. There is probably no adequate alternative to rich countries and powerful companies footing the bill.

61465729-aca9-40d1-983d-72a23642449f,"The climate summit just concluding in Egypt ran hard into one of the world’s greatest structural problems: most of the money is in the Global North, but most of the need is in the Global South. Nearly three hundred years of burning fossil fuels have produced much of that northern wealth, and now the resulting greenhouse gases are heating the planet and producing much of that southern need. So is there some way to mobilize that money to build a more livable future? The conference went into overtime on Saturday, in part to make a small start on that very big question.

For two weeks, the money issue bedevilled negotiators in the grim warehouse in a desert that Egypt, the host police state, offered up as the headquarters for the annual global gathering. It’s actually a fairly new focus—until now, most COP meetings have primarily aimed to pressure the big emitting nations to set ambitious targets for decarbonization. But the congressional passage of the Inflation Reduction Act finally brought the laggard United States into some kind of compliance with its proffered carbon-reduction targets, and a recent meeting between President Joe Biden and President Xi Jinping of China, at the G-20 conference on November 14th, seemed to indicate that coöperation between the carbon superpowers was back on some sort of track, after it was derailed by Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan. For now, the industrialized world is working on its own energy transformation.

If Biden thought that his efforts would buy him some affection at the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties, he was only partly right. As delegates streamed toward the plenary to hear his speech, they passed a crowd of activists chanting “Pay up, pay up, pay up for loss and damage.” Many of the protesters were from Africa; this is just the third COP on the continent, and civil society had been awaiting it keenly, because Africa is the best example of the world’s economic gulf. Though it has produced just a small percentage of the greenhouse gases now warming the Earth, it is fast falling prey to almost unimaginable floods and droughts. In South Sudan, for instance, to the west of the fast-warming Indian Ocean, so-called once-in-a-century rains fell in 2019 and again in 2020. Bloomberg reported that, in August, 2021, “with the land saturated even after average rainfall, the White Nile flooded. The Lol [River] was stopped by the weight of the waters. It began to flow backwards and burst its banks—the worst flooding in 60 years. There are some one million people here among the world’s permanently displaced by climate change.” Meanwhile, a thousand kilometres away, in Somalia, the fifth straight rainy season without much rain is currently under way; scientists are now predicting a sixth and attributing the drought to climate change.

You can imagine the tension—the anger—that comes from watching your part of the world dry up or flood, knowing that the countries whose pollution caused your problems also have enough dollars to repair the damage. The moral argument couldn’t be more straightforward: Americans have produced almost a quarter of the excess carbon in the atmosphere; a quarter of the damage should be on our tab. And yet we have not yet started to pay it, not in any straightforward way: Congress won’t spend tax dollars on reparations for the descendants of enslaved Africans; they’re even more unlikely to do it for survivors of the climate crisis in Africa or Asia. At least, not in sums remotely equal to the damage: at COP27, a handful of the usual countries (think Denmark) pledged climate-relief aid on the order of about seventy-five million dollars, with an “M.” The initial estimate of the damage from Pakistan’s wild summer of flooding, by contrast, is about forty billion dollars, with a “B.”

So there needs to be some less direct way of accessing the wealth of the north. More than half the world’s capital is in the U.S. and Europe; more than a third of it is in the U.S. alone. Much of that money lies in retirement accounts—money that isn’t charitable, and won’t simply be turned over to cover what the U.N. calls the “loss and damage” of climate change, no matter how just the claim of the poor nations might be. But the trillions of dollars in those funds could provide the financing that the developing world needs for an energy transition—and if African nations have the funding to build, say, solar arrays, they can generate lower-cost clean energy and produce a return for American pensioners. At the moment, though, that’s unlikely. Investing in an American wind farm is relatively easy; the pension fund can predict their earnings based on a hundred years of historical returns from utility companies. Investing in a Senegalese solar company that lacks a track record, and which could be at the whims of the local political and judicial system, would be a different story. Because such investments are relatively risky, pension funds would charge prohibitively high interest.

“With money at six or seven per cent, solar in Africa can outcompete anything and turn a profit,” Nicholas Stern, an old warrior in these fights whom I stumbled across in the corridors of COP27, told me. “At fifteen per cent you can’t make a profit, and so it won’t happen.” Currently a professor at the London School of Economics, Lord Stern was once the chief economist at the World Bank, and is most famous for having authored—in 2006, at the behest of the U.K. government—the most comprehensive account of how much climate change was going to cost the world. A lot, as it turned out. “Climate change is a result of the greatest market failure the world has seen,” he wrote. “Those who damage others by emitting greenhouse gases generally do not pay.” But he keeps trying to find ways around that basic impasse.

Basically, you need to figure out how to de-risk the investment, so that a pension fund feels as comfortable investing in an African solar farm as in a Kansas windmill, as John Kerry explained to me in October. And the tools for that de-risking belong to the multilateral development banks—the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the African Development Bank. These organs, among other things, manage flows of money from north to south—and they’re filled with clever people who can figure out how to sprinkle, say, a little bit of public money into a deal so that the hazard largely disappears. Stern’s estimate, in a long paper published just before the COP, is that this would require “grants and low interest loans from the governments of developed countries to double from $30 billion today to $60 billion by 2025.” Spend that relatively small sum—just a fraction of the nine trillion dollars that rich countries spent on COVID, and an even tinier fraction of the overall cost of climate change—and private investors would likely plow a trillion dollars into developing markets. But even this relative bargain can seem out of reach: even a Congress controlled by Democrats refused to approve Biden’s request for $11.4 billion annually for this kind of aid. If future House Speaker Kevin McCarthy was unsure about sending weapons to Ukraine, one guesses that sending cash to Africa may not be high on his to-do list."
2d9058f2-3536-4228-a708-b81e94fe7a74,"Searing heat waves, hypercharged storms, rising sea levels, devastating droughts and floods — evidence of climate change’s calamitous impact is being felt from the Bahamas to Bangladesh, and it’s fueling a growing movement for climate “reparations.”

This push for major, debt-free funding for climate-vulnerable countries that have contributed little to the onset of global warming has made significant strides in recent years — and the issue gained new momentum at the ongoing United Nations climate conference in the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt.

Meena Gabeena, founder of Meenay Laas, a voluntary disaster relief group in Pakistan, was in the southwestern Baluchistan province when floods ravaged the country over the summer, inundating at some points up to a third of its surface. Torrential monsoon rains and melting glaciers drowned entire villages, as rivers burst their banks, leaving millions marooned and vital crops destroyed. More than 1,700 people, including more than 500 children, were killed in the extreme flooding and 33 million more displaced.

It was one of many dramatic weather patterns this year to hit countries that bear little responsibility for the climate-fueled disasters that are becoming increasingly common.

Pakistan’s environmental footprint — how much carbon it has put into the atmosphere in recent decades — is significantly less than other countries. And at an individual level, the environmental footprint of most Pakistanis is much smaller than people in countries like the United States.

“Not a single person on the ground has any fault with what’s happening to them,” said Gabeena who, like many relief workers, activists and policymakers, wants to see a rapid and significant redistribution of wealth from the global north to the global south to deal with apocalyptic climate impacts she believes the rest of the world is yet to wake up to.

Wealthy nations increasingly are being called upon to pay up, with $75.8 million being pledged in “loss and damage” payments at COP27 so far. At the previous climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, wealthy nations rejected proposals for a specific loss and damage fund, although countries agreed to start a “dialogue” on the issue."
27ed6e5f-ad76-4092-9061-078e61329c2c,"Under the Paris Agreement, which came into force in 2016, countries agreed to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and work together to adapt to the effects of climate change. To act on this, and codify their individual commitments, each country submitted its so-called Nationally Determined Contribution.

These clearly spell out the climate actions they intend to undertake to limit global warming to below 2℃, compared to pre-industrial levels. The first contributions were officially submitted in 2020. They are meant to be updated every five years.

Based on the cost estimates from the 51 African countries that submitted their plans in 2020, the financial burden of achieving their contributions is about US$2.8 trillion between now and 2030. The same African governments have cumulatively pledged to contribute about US$264 billion of this from their own national coffers. This means the missing gap is still US$2.5 trillion.

Where is this going to come from?

Part of the answer is climate finance. This is being discussed as part of the Paris Agreement negotiations, and is a key theme of the COP27 conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt.

This finance can come from a variety of sources – public, private, or other. But it is specifically earmarked for activities and investments linked to mitigating or adapting to the effects of climate change.

The current architecture of the institutions and funds that provide climate finance is, however, not designed to work at a sub-national level. Therefore across the globe, cities are being left out. This situation is even more pertinent for African cities as Africa is both the fastest urbanising continent in the world and among the most vulnerable to climatic change. Yet the continent is receiving, by far, the lowest climate finance flows overall.

Africa is losing out, its cities even more

Estimates put global climate finance flows for 2019 at US$622 billion. This is significantly below global needs. And the lowest proportion of these flows, an estimated 3%, is coming to the African continent.

By comparison, 43.6% is directed at East Asia and the Pacific. Yet Africa is contributing least to the global greenhouse gas emissions. And it’s the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change overall.

This meagre proportion is even more concentrated within the continent. It’s estimated that 40% of climate finance went has gone to just five countries. They are Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria, Ethiopia and Kenya.

Cities are receiving only a trickle of this money. The reason is that the global climate finance architecture is biased towards national and regional institutions. This prevents cities from accessing it easily.

For example, 2019 data from Africa shows that the largest source of climate finance was multilateral development finance institutions. They accounted for about US$11.5 billion of climate finance flows. But these institutions are mostly mandated to work at a national level. They can’t lend directly to cities.

It’s the same for dedicated multilateral climate funds, such as the Green Climate Fund. The fund is the largest dedicated source of climate finance. But most of the entities accredited to it are either national, regional or international.

On top of this, the fund has no mechanism to lend directly to sub-national entities.

The second constraint for cities has to do with the fact that climate finance is dominated by loans. For Africa, loans made up about 57% of the overall financial flows in 2019. Yet across Africa most cities cannot access loans, because of legislative constraints and low creditworthiness.

Loans are primarily directed at activities that can generate a return. This means funding is strongly biased towards mitigation activities as these tend to generate better returns than those for adaptation. As such, financing for mitigation makes up around two-thirds of total flows.

Loans also are likely to exclude funding many of the public services and infrastructures that cities are required to provide. These may not generate the economic returns needed to attract this form of finance.

Finally, sectorally, only about 4.5% of total climate finance flows in Africa in 2019 went to addressing the large and growing infrastructure deficit.

This is particularly concerning for rapidly growing African cities as current cities need retrofitting. And two-thirds of Africa’s cities are yet to be built between now and 2050. In addition, infrastructure will need to be built in a way that ensures it’s resilient to the effects of the climate change.

The upfront investment for this may be slightly more expensive, by some estimates, approximately 3% of total construction costs. But future benefits could be up to four times larger than these costs of investment.

The future

Cities are the frontline of tackling some of the most severe effects of climate change. They are also at the forefront of achieving a low emissions and climate resilient future. Globally, cities account for approximately 70% of carbon emissions.

The hopes are high that COP27 – given that it’s being held in Africa – can deliver actions to tackle the climate emergencies that are critical to the African continent. This will necessarily include increasing the overall climate finance flows.

However, merely increasing the financing available will not be sufficient. The financing must find its way to cities.

Some solutions include ensuring the multilateral development banks and climate funds can develop dedicated local financing mechanisms that allow them to directly meet the needs of cities.

At national levels governments will also need to do more work to ensure both that their Nationally Determined Contributions directly reflect urban priorities and that these receive the dedicated attention and financing required.

At a city level, cities need to urgently work on improving their creditworthiness so that when legislation permits, they are in a financial position to take on loans in particular.

As former United Nations secretary general Ban Ki-moon famously said:

Our struggle for global sustainability will be won or lost in cities.

That’s why it’s so important to start making sure there is enough money to support this struggle."

In response to Miliband's discussing the issue, ""the conservative ecosystem surrounding GB News immediately attacked Miliband, attempting to rebrand Loss and Damage as ‘climate reparations’ and make that idea toxic for citizens - a disinformation playbook made explicit by Chris Rufo in his work pushing the anti-Critical Race Theory narrative .""

The report found:

The main lines of pushback were those claiming ‘climate reparations’ would benefit China and Pakistan , the latter of whom suffered unprecedented floods earlier this year and strongly endorses a negotiated loss and damage outcome at COP27 - its diaspora have also been a regular target of racial discrimination since communities established in Britain in the 20th century.

Though the racism isn't fully vocalized, commentators are clearly playing to such sentiments:

One widely shared post demanded COVID reparations from China in turn, while others reframed the discussion to play on identity politics and national pride, claiming that Britain is being punished for spearheading the industrial revolution and thus global human flourishing. The issue was also widely linked to the cost of living crisis, with arguments around strained public finances and high energy cost for British citizens (compared to housing "" illegal migrants in 4/5 star hotels "".)

Meanwhile, in Australia, we're getting some advanced notice about a new anti-Net Zero campaign from Advance Australia, which ""at first appears to be a far-right and ’culture wars’ advocacy group,"" but upon closer inspection, it appears that ""climate denial and messages opposing climate action have been at the core of their campaigning.""

Advance Australia "" announced their aim to launch the ‘biggest campaign yet’ to shift conservative Australian political powers against climate action"" on Nov 3.

In the past two weeks, researchers found they ""have been trialling Facebook and Instagram ads targeting mostly men above 45 in two Australian states, Queensland and New South Wales. It deployed 25 visual variations of an ad with text, spending under AU$2675 (US$1700). This is very low compared to their regular investments and likely indicates an ‘A/B testing’ or ‘ramping-up’ phase of a campaign.""

It's still impossible to predict the future, but seeing that the opposition is testing its ads is the next best thing!"

For the first time, this year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) has officially put the topic of “loss and damage” on the agenda for world leaders to discuss in the next two weeks—moving forward the conversation on compensating countries for the damages already wrought by climate change, not just putting money toward disaster preparedness. World leaders, including Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley, have praised the inclusion of the topic and called for measurable change to take place.

“We believe that it is critical that we address the issue of ‘loss and damage.’ The talk must come to an end,” Mottley said yesterday.

Loss and damage, simply put, is a catch-all term for helping developing nations hit hard by the effects of climate change. Some small European nations have pledged modest sums toward loss and damage, but there is still intense disagreement over who should receive the aid, the amount provided, and who should be held liable. And it’s extremely unlikely these questions will be resolved at COP27.

There’s a deep power imbalance at the heart of the issue. Wealthy, developed nations are far and away producing the majority of emissions that have raised the average yearly surface temperature of the globe by roughly 2 degrees Fahrenheit since the pre-industrial era—but developing nations are disproportionately bearing the brunt of the ensuing extreme weather events. Take recent flooding in Pakistan: Climate change likely drove the floods that have killed thousands and displaced millions of Pakistanis since August, but the country itself is responsible for less than 1 percent of global carbon emissions. To many global leaders, the situation facing countries like Pakistan reeks of unfairness, particularly in the absence of any form of payment from wealthier nations.

Wealthy nations like the U.S. have historically dragged their feet to acknowledge, much less negotiate loss and damage, possibly out of a fear that compensating developing countries could strengthen a legal case holding developed nations liable for future climate-related damages. There’s also uncertainty and cynicism over cost—in September, U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry made a telling remark about America’s willingness to compensate for loss and damage. “You tell me the government in the world that has trillions of dollars, cause that’s what it costs,” he told the audience at a New York Times event.

Social Media Is Now a Vital Lifeline for Flood Victims

Reportedly, even slotting loss and damage into COP27’s agenda for discussion was a contentious fight, requiring negotiators to work overnight. Conversations about liability and compensation are to remain off the table, as per the resulting compromise.

Some like Mottley stressed that discussions over loss and damage cannot be limited to just talks between world leaders—they must include large corporate polluters like profit-driven oil and gas companies, and hold them accountable for their roles in the ongoing crisis. Otherwise, it’s as U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told COP27 attendees yesterday: “We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot still on the accelerator.”

World leaders have gathered in Egypt this week to begin climate talks at the 27th Conference of the Parties. However, there are still outstanding questions about who should pay for climate change losses and damages. Vulnerable countries hit hardest by climate change are asking the wealthier countries most responsible for these damages for compensation.

Climate change correspondent Lauren Sommer joins Emily Kwong to talk about this debate — and the case one island nation is making to seek payment.

Amid a backdrop of protests — on climate change and the Egyptian government’s spotty human rights record — the focus is on the commitments each country made at last year's conference to curb their emissions.





But there’s another debate brewing. Developing nations — the most vulnerable to the consequences of climate change — want financial support as they deal with the fallout. And they’re looking to wealthier nations, which have disproportionately emitted carbon into the atmosphere. Climate reporter Sarah Kaplan joins us to discuss how a potential “loss and damages” fund would work, and where we are on a changing global climate."

National representatives from around the world are gathering at the COP27 conference in Egypt right now, and a complicated economic question is at the center of the discussion. Should wealthy nations with higher levels of carbon emissions compensate lower-income, less industrialized countries that are disproportionately bearing the cost of the climate crisis? And if so, how do you quantify the economic, environmental and cultural damage suffered by these countries into one neat sum?

Today, we bring you an episode of Short Wave. Our colleagues walk us through the political and economic consequences of this question, and what the negotiations going on at COPP27 might do to address it.

a4ae83eb-44ab-49d6-aaf1-a528e09588d4,"Experts say a large methane plume spotted on the border of Alberta and Saskatchewan demonstrates the need for better emissions regulation.

A European Space Agency satellite picked up the plume near Lloydminster last month. Kayrros, an energy and environmental geo-analytics company, noticed and analyzed the data it captured.

A report from the firm estimated the plume had an emissions rate of 11 tonnes an hour, roughly equivalent to the annual emissions of 200 cars.

Methane emissions are also more potent to global warming than carbon dioxide, especially in the 20 years after entering the atmosphere.

Christian Lelong, director of climate solutions for Kayrros, says regulators need to amp up efforts to prevent the creation of similar events.

""We often see these kinds of events in proximity to gas pipelines,"" Lelong said in an interview. ""Now we have the tools to detect [greenhouse gasses] by region, company, and facility.

""The good news is this is a very important step in addressing the problem in helping companies and the industry as a whole in reducing its carbon footprint and working toward climate initiatives.""

The Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) is responsible for overseeing pipeline and energy development, including controlled burns and gasses purposefully released into the atmosphere.

The AER accesses data from the same satellite but said the cloud was not flagged.

Optical gas imaging

Regulations in Canada are mostly based on surveys that use optical gas imaging (OGI) cameras at oil and gas sites to detect sources of methane leaks.

But a study published last year suggests there is a stark difference between what the OGI surveys find and what new airplane-mounted technology can see. It surmised that policy and regulations relying on OGI could be missing a significant portion of emissions.

More than half of methane emissions were attributed to storage tanks, reciprocating compressors and unlit flares, according to the study. Storage tanks alone accounted for a quarter of methane emissions at oil and gas sites.

These sources are harder to detect with OGI surveys because they are elevated and might be missed by a camera at ground level.

Matthew Johnson, the study's co-author and head of the energy and emissions research lab at Carleton University, said in an email he is not surprised by the recent plume's location.

""It would be helpful to know the actual location and extent of the 'plume,' Johnson said. ""The area has historically seen very high levels of direct/intentional venting of gas during cold heavy oil production with sand.""

AER investigation

The AER said in an emailed statement that it had conducted an investigation into the plume. Companies are required to notify the agency and the public before flaring or venting operations.

""Our team conducted a thorough investigation of venting events reported and found no significant venting events in the area reported to the AER at that time,"" the statement read, adding that elevated methane concentrations does not indicate non-compliance or an industry-related event.

Jan Gorski, director of the Pembina Institute's oil and gas program, said consistent regulation is vital to spotting emissions.

""The source, location, and generation of methane emissions is unpredictable, which is why we need good measurement and monitoring to catch these rare events,"" he said.

""If it's something caught by satellite it shows that it was a pretty significant source of methane emissions.""

Gorski said the current data on the average level of methane emissions from the gas sector is based on studies from more than a decade ago.

He said information need to be updated in order to improve regulations and monitoring.

The federal government's climate plan to reach net-zero by 2050 has an interim goal to cut emissions across all sectors 40 to 45 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030.

That would require a 42 per cent cut in oil and gas emissions, something Gorski says won't be accomplished until there is a more narrow and accurate estimation of emissions in the energy sector."
31bce2cd-3d71-43ae-88a4-83fc6faa811e,"This has been a year of climate catastrophes for every corner of the globe. From floods in Pakistan and Nigeria to the worst droughts on record across the Horn of Africa, no one on the planet is insulated against our rapidly worsening climate. Among the most disproportionately affected are women and girls. Yet their story is all too often just a footnote in the news.

We know about the gendered impact of climate change from our work across the world. We have seen time and time again how women and girls are pushed to drop out of school or marry early to help manage the financial stress that families face during droughts or floods. New ActionAid research in Kenya, Rwanda, Zambia and Nigeria has found that climate change is also increasing gender-based violence and damaging women’s mental health.

As a warming planet leads to a rise in humanitarian emergencies and displacement, women and girls must not be left to pay the steepest price.

In northern Kenya, Rosemary — a former farmer whom ActionAid works with — now needs to walk several miles farther than before to find water. Her community is facing extreme drought after consecutive failed rains, with 90 percent of all open water sources in their area now dry. This increased burden and the distances she has to go put her at greater risk of violence as she needs to travel, often outside daylight hours, to areas where she has no protection.

Meanwhile, the drought and the invasion of a crop-eating worm pest have already destroyed her farm, once her main source of income. This has forced Rosemary into animal husbandry, but she faces the challenges of an unpredictable climate here too. Unable to access water and grassland, two of her cows recently died, pushing her further into financial precarity.

Farmer incomes have dropped sharply in Rosemary’s community because of the failed rains. This is leading to girls being taken out of school — and in some cases married off — to ease family expenditure and help to bring in income. In precarious times of climate stress like this, girls are 20 percent more likely to be married early than in times of stability, putting women’s rights to education and liberty at risk.

But it doesn’t have to be this way. Women and girls on the front line of the climate crisis, like Rosemary, know what actions are needed and are important agents of change. Rosemary leads a local activist network that tackles violence against women and girls and provides guidance to young women on their human rights. This support is key for women and girls navigating the knock-on impacts of climate change and drought.

Women like Rosemary are capable of building communities that are resilient to the challenges of climate change. But they need support to scale up their work and the opportunity to help decide how international, national and local climate finance is spent.

Yet, sadly, we know that the voices of the women on the front lines are not sufficiently heard in the grand halls and behind the closed doors where the big decisions are made, including at the ongoing COP27 climate change conference. This is particularly worrying in 2022 as the impacts of climate change escalate while international support for women like Rosemary remains scarce.

Industrialised nations that have contributed the most to the climate crisis are yet to deliver on their promised — yet inadequate — funding to help mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change in the future. These failed promises, combined with the lack of finance to support climate impacts now — known as loss and damage finance — means that the odds are loaded against a funding paradigm that accounts for the additional risks and consequences women and girls face.

While the United Kingdom is increasing its financial support for climate adaptation, it has not pledged new and additional loss and damage funding to countries like Kenya, which is battling its worst drought on record.

This is unacceptable. Climate finance needs to cover reparations for the lost years of girls’ education, address women’s lost security, and compensate for their failed crop yields. We need progress on these issues at COP27, not yet another year of kicking the can down the road.

World leaders need to pay attention to stories like Rosemary’s. We need less rhetoric and a greater focus on women’s rights and actions to help them thrive and bring their communities out of poverty. Without this, the gendered injustice of climate change and the silent crisis for women and girls will only get worse.

65767ec7-a276-4051-8a02-d82dc88cc712,"CAIRO – 14 November 2022: Minister of Environment Yasmin Fouad delivered Monday a speech on behalf of President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi at the opening of Gender Thematic Day taking place within the activities of COP 27 held in Sharm El Sheikh.

The president's speech noted that making a better future in light of climate change is unattainable without green transition inclusive of women.

""As you are well aware, the wide-ranging and multifaceted threats facing the planet

due to the climate change crisis, with its serious repercussions are exacerbated day

by day. Which makes it the most serious existential challenge to the future of all

humanity,"" President Sisi underlined.

""Women are considered among the most affected groups by these repercussions, in

light of the general persistent inequalities in women's access to resources and

services, and the insufficiency of adequate programs and policies that reflect their

needs in times of environmental crises and in the face of climate change,"" the president elaborated.

The chief of state added that is especially true in poor and rural areas, and in developing nations, particularly on the African continent.

""Nevertheless, women remain key drivers and significant accelerators in addressing

the effects of climate change. They are among the most aware of the crisis, faster

in taking action, and able to innovate ""smart green solutions"" to address its

repercussions and effects, whether at the family, the local, or the national

communities’ level. We have also witnessed at the international level the active and

influential participation of women in the work of this conference,"" President Sisi said.

The president highlighted that ""in preparation for Egypt's hosting of the COP27 conference, we had launched our vision on women, environment and climate change, last March on the sidelines of the annual meeting of the Committee on the Status of Women at the United Nations in New York.""

""I would honestly say, achieving any significant progress in addressing the

repercussions of climate change will not be possible without achieving climate

justice for all, which undoubtedly constitutes the full integration and involvement of

women in various aspects of addressing this phenomenon. This should be reflected

in securing their needs within the frameworks of strategies, programs, and financing

plans concerning climate change,"" President Sisi stressed.

Concluding his speech, the Egyptian president addressed women saying, ""You have demonstrated unique strength and wisdom in the face of the COVID-19

pandemic crisis that has ravaged the world for the last three years. We now count

on you to continue your noble role, with certainty that you will be the icon of

positive change in the face of the repercussions of climate change. """
59647db7-3ea8-47f8-a885-bb5eb36c7ba9,"In 2016, I (Catherine) was slated to give Canada’s statement as minister for environment and climate change at the COP22 climate negotiations in Marrakesh. Instead, I decided to share that time with Maatalii Okalik, then the president of the National Inuit Youth Council of Canada. I knew this young Inuk woman would convey more compellingly than I how climate change was affecting her community—their land, the ice, culture, food, health, safety—and how it is threatening that community’s very existence. I wasn’t allowed to cede the stage to her, but I decided to break the rules. The delegates were inspired by Maatali’s story, and it really set the stage for negotiations and the stakes to get a successful outcome.

As world leaders gather this week at COP27, men and other allies should consider this example and cede podium time to women.* In addition, we need to break more conventions and rules to ensure that underrepresented women’s voices are heard throughout these negotiations. This is especially critical as attendees discuss how the countries of the Global North, responsible for most of the world’s carbon output, should help the Global South deal with the effects of that pollution. The perspectives of women, whose voices are underrepresented in climate discussions, are instrumental to solving the climate crisis in a more just and equitable fashion and can contribute powerfully to our understanding of climate action across the globe.

Ceding the floor to women at these meetings is more than just a gesture; it’s a matter of fairness. U.N. studies show that 80 percent of people displaced by climate change are women. The floods in Pakistan earlier this year are a prime example: huge numbers of rural women have lost their homes and their livelihoods, and about 650,000 women could now face disruptions in pregnancy-related health care. The effects of climate change on women compound existing gendered conditions that exist in many places. This includes higher income inequality and financial insecurity. And we know that with a changing climate, if we do not act decisively now, the situation will only get worse.

At the same time, women are leading the way around the world in advocating for climate action and providing solutions. Young women are on the streets demanding change. Indigenous women are mobilizing in their communities. Women scientists are doing critical climate research and innovating in labs. And many women parliamentarians are pushing for climate-positive laws in government.

But, when it comes to international climate negotiations, where policy changes are solidified and goals are set for climate-mitigating and adaptive actions, these women’s voices need to be amplified. And we need to not only hear more women’s voices, we need to hear a far greater diversity of women’s voices. That diversity reflects the experiences that women are experiencing in locations suffering the most, whether deforestation, economic hardship, displacement, extreme weather, food insecurity or any combination of these challenges.

The U.N.’s strong commitment to promote gender equality is making progress. Over the years, women have come to comprise a larger percentage of the delegates to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change’s (UNFCCC) constituted bodies, the chief technical and decision-making committees for global climate deliberations. For example, in 2021, the Adaptation Committee reached 68 percent women’s membership.

But at the main negotiating tables, major barriers to women remain. The Gender Action Plan calls for women's full, equal and meaningful participation in the U.N. climate process and to ensure a prominent role for women in decision-making and climate policies. However, fewer than 30 percent of the lead negotiators are women. This is despite progress; many country national climate action plans now cross-reference gender, and country delegations include more women. And at last year’s plenary sessions at the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP) in Glasgow, men had a disproportionately higher share of active speaking roles at the important plenary sessions and took up 74 percent of the speaking time. We hope this year and next year can be different.

It’s beyond time to acknowledge inside the halls of COPs—and not just on the streets outside the main venues—that grassroots movements, feminist collectives and women of color have historically spearheaded more equitable and inclusive solutions to climate change. We need traditional knowledge and different visions of sustainable development and community engagement rather than business as usual at the center of climate action deliberations. Women shouldn’t have to keep yelling from the bleachers.

Academic research on women’s participation in global negotiations points to more durable outcomes and greater ease in bridging cultural and sectarian divides. Research has also highlighted how higher women’s political participation contributes more robustly to spending on health and foreign aid, as well as expenditures targeting women’s needs, all of which is critical to this current round of climate negotiations. Women leaders also cultivate stronger ties to local community leaders and civic networks, which is particularly important for climate policy where knowledge of localized effects is evolving and is variable from place to place.

As delegates struggle to navigate the most difficult elements of global climate negotiations— loss and damage and climate finance for the Global South—women and Indigenous people deserve an outsized voice because it is their fate that is most in jeopardy.

We know that existing inequality and power imbalances in various societies can be deadly for women and girls when severe weather and other climatic events strike in those socioeconomic and cultural contexts. In many locations, women don’t own land or have access to economic assets that might protect them during natural disasters or enhance their mobility.

Indigenous women are at the front lines of protecting forests and biodiversity. Women have direct roles in promoting disaster response and climate adaptation. Younger activists, who have rejected the status quo, should not be asked to shoulder a burden created by previous generations.

Besides being more inclusive of who gets to speak at official meetings of the COP27, we urge delegates to target in their finance deliberations more specific funding to training women delegates, especially those from least developed countries, so they can participate actively in the negotiations. More funds need to be allocated to cover their travel to international meetings and to enable their active participation. Major donors to the U.N. system should step up to the plate to make sure more resources are being targeted to achieve gender equality in official climate meetings, both for COPs and for constituted body sessions. As the discussion moves more squarely onto adaptation finance and loss and damage, women’s voices must be louder and more salient, given women’s prominent role in small-scale agriculture, social care roles and disaster recovery around the globe.

If this week’s climate deliberations are to meet the moment, they will need to go beyond past paradigms and patterns of decision-making. What’s needed is a bolder vision for how to move forward, one that truly encompasses who is harmed by climate change, what they need to adapt and thrive, and how to heal the planet. So far, the traditional political hierarchies have failed to present real alternatives. It’s time to open the door to those who are most directly affected and who might have greater insights on the urgent response that is required.

50380835-049d-4d7a-b368-a4bce22572e4,"CAIRO – 14 November 2022: President of the National Council for Women (NCW) Maya Morsi presented – in her speech at the opening of COP 27's thematic day on women – the objectives of the African Women Climate Adaptive Priorities (AWCAP) initiative launched by Egypt.

The AWCAP objectives are:

Creation of a nexus among the ministers of environment and heads of bodies concerned with women affairs and empowerment

Promotion of knowledge production, enhancing the provision of climate information technologies, data collection, research, exchange of experiences

Strengthening commitments pertinent to investing in women, especially in education in certain fields such as STEMCapitalizing on existing public-private-partnerships

Promotion of gender sensitive social protection policies and measures to ensure just transition pathways

There are three main goals that AWCAP would manage to achieve. One is ensuring that women get a share in the $500 billion to be spent in the coming 10 years on re-skilling employees within green transition efforts.

Another is boosting the number of women working in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields in Africa, as their percentage currently stands at 36 percent. As for the third goal, it is about channeling funding to women-led green start-ups.

Morsy also stated the reasons Egypt launched the initiative, and they are:

African women are almost 50% of the continents population.

Rural women in Africa are at a significant risk of being adversely affected by climate change due to household responsibilities and increased agricultural work and displacement resulting from climate impacts. Not to mention, in the wake of disasters

Women and children in Africa are 80% of those in need of assistance while, poor women are 14 times more likely to die during a natural disaster.

Almost 40% agricultural workforce in 46 of 53 African countries are women.

Women represent just 15% of landholders, and 70% of the continent's food is produced by women.

The gender gap in information, communication and technology (ICT) in Africa is 23%.

African Women are heavily reliant on environment- related livelihoods, working in disproportionately climate-exposed sectors such as agriculture and livestock management, forestry, water management, and health.

Existing inequalities facing women and girls limit sustainable and equitable transition to resilient water- energy-food systems, especially in the most climate change prone areas."
bfc69db2-0a7f-47dd-ac57-9b57902d5496,"CAIRO - 14 November 2022: Mahmoud Mohieldin, UN Climate Change High Level Champion for Egypt and UN Special Envoy on Financing 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, said that women have leadership qualities and the ability to solve problems, which make their participation in development and climate action indispensable.

His remarks came during his participation in the opening session of Gender Day in COP27 ""Women's Agency in Climate Dialogues and Implementation, Win Win for All"", in which Dr Yasmine Fouad, Minister of Environment, gave a speech in behalf of Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, President of Egypt, with the participation of Dr Rania El-Mashat, Minister of International Cooperation, Dr Hala El-Said, Minister of Planning and Economic Development, Dr Nevine El-Kabbag, Minister of Social Solidarity, Dr Ghada Waly, Under-Secretary-General of the UN, Executive Director of the UN Office on Drugs, Dr Maya Morsy, President of Egypt's National Council for Women, Dr Sima Bahous, Executive Director of UN Women, beside a number of African women ministers, women leaders and representatives of regional and international organizations.

""Women around the world have proven their capabilities to make decisions and solve problems through their leadership of international organizations, governments and ministries in different countries."" Mohieldin said, noting that women are always at the heart of problems and always give solutions.

Mohieddin said that women are victims of crises in the world, such as poverty, hunger, lack of funding and lack of education, adding that two-thirds of world's women suffer lack of education, and they represent 63 percent of poor people across the world, which stresses the need to enhance women's access to education and finance.

He stressed the importance of pluralism and the need to improve women's participation in decision-making regarding development and climate action, pointing to the importance of the National Council for Women initiative on raising awareness among women about climate issues.

Mohieldin pointed to women's active participation in the National initiative for smart green projects, in which they have submitted more than 1000 projects out of about 6000 that were registered, and 3 projects out of 18 winning projects were submitted by women.

He stressed the importance of fair finance flow through soft grants to developing countries, in a way that contributes to empowering women in different fields.

Additionally, during a session entitled ""Earth Observations Systems for Monitoring and Managing River Basin Systems"", Mohieldin said that climate action must take place within a holistic framework that includes all dimensions of the Paris Climate Agreement, adding that there is no place for trade-offs between Sustainable development Goals (SDGs), as actual climate action will not be possible without delivering energy to all, providing food and protecting water sources.

The climate champion stressed the importance of science and updated databases role in climate action, noting that the early warning system proposed by United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, which African countries will benefit from, needs constantly updated databases.

""Promoting scientific activity needs sufficient finance, there are good initiatives have been launched during the conference that linked academic community more to climate action."" Mohieldin said, praising in this context the Egyptian initiative to improve the role of universities and research centers in climate action."

Mohieldin’s remarks came during his participation in a session entitled “Women and Climate Change Finance” in the presence of Minister of International Cooperation Rania Al-Mashat, President of the National Council for Women Maya Morsi, Director of Economic Inclusion and Gender Equality at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Barbara Rambosek, environmental activist in Chad Hindu Omaru Ibrahim and Regional Director For the Global Center for Adaptation Anthony Nyong'o.

In this context, Mohieldin referred to the National Initiative for Smart Green Projects at the level of the Egyptian governorates in cooperation with the Ministry of Planning, Environment and International Cooperation and a number of concerned parties, as this initiative witnessed adequate representation of women in the six categories, but there is a need to strengthen the participation of women in this initiative. The initiative will be held every year, he added.

Mohieldin added that the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, Amina Mohammed, announced that this initiative will be a major part of the upcoming climate summits, pointing to the presentation of a number of winning projects in the initiative at COP27.

On the other hand, Mohieldin explained that many projects related to resilience in the face of climate changes and projects related to food security are led by women, which requires the provision of easy financing means, stressing that global financing conditions have a direct impact on women's participation in climate action at the local and international levels.

Mohieldin also stressed the need to promote long-term investments to support investable and bankable projects, especially in sectors that are difficult to direct investents to, praising the concessional financing policies of the International Development Agency (IDA).

Mohieldin concluded his speech by emphasizing the promotion of women's participation in leadership positions through appropriate legislation and a change in behavior in this regard."
931f8b5e-f961-4c09-a4bb-6595315fe8ee,"SHARM EL SHEIKH, Egypt - 14 November 2022: Today, the main talk in the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) in Sharm El-Sheikh is about gender and how women’s role is important in preserving the environment. Several COP27 participants from different countries spoke to Egypt Today, calling for more women inclusion and gender justice when it comes to climate action.

Daniel Fisher from the UK told Egypt Today that it is so important to keep the indigenous leaders in general, and indigenous women in particular, involved not only in side events but also in decision making meetings.

“Without women in our projects, they cannot succeed,” said Fisher, who represents Ecosphere, which helps companies adopt climate change solutions for reaching zero net emissions. He also called for making gender equality voices be heard.

Moreover, Dorceta Taylor, a professor in Environmental Justice and Food Security at Yale University, told Egypt Today that her students and she are in Egypt and “are very actively involved in a host of issues about the gender, food security, justice and equality.”

“I am particularly excited about all the young women I am seeing here from hundreds of different countries and that is exciting because that means we have the energy. […] Women are the force of environmental justice, climate justice, energy justice, transportation justice, and overall equality. What is stimulating and very very interesting here is seeing so much energy from women, who are grandmothers, mothers, and children. The future generation is very good and I hope this continues in their future,"" Taylor said in her statement.

Prince Israel Orekha from Nigeria, who also represents the Empowerment and Youth Development Initiative, told Egypt Today that women should be empowered as the people go with climate mitigation for local solutions. He added that women should be encouraged to participate in climate solutions as a sustainable part to mitigate climate crisis.

“As today is a gender day, we are advocating that more women should be supported […] Remember the theme ‘Together For Implementation,’ so women are empowered together as they carry out the implementation in order to see there is a sustainable and inclusive intervention, so let’s give more women a chance and empower them as they can also do well,” the prince stated.

Also, Adelina and Serena from Malaysia's Global Environment Center spoke on the gender day.

""We have to say that there should be gender inclusion for all the actions that happen for climate mitigation. We need to recognize the efforts of the women in their communities as they have tremendous efforts to protect forests,"" said Serena while showing examples of hand-made products by indigenous women in Malaysia."
c34d47dc-9eb3-4fc7-8057-110bfffa2322,"CAIRO – 14 November 2022: President of Egypt's National Council for Women (NWC) Maya Morsy delivered Monday the opening speech of COP 27 Gender Thematic Day at Sharm El Sheikh highlighting the country's initiatives on women and environment locally and internationally.

""The focus of the day is the role of women in the decision-making process pertaining to climate action and finance, the nexus between COVID19- Climate crisis and women’s empowerment, and women realities in light of adaptation, mitigation, and just environmental transition efforts,"" the NWC president explained.

Underscoring the negative impact of climate change on women, Morsi stipulated that the phenomenon is not gender neutral as women are more harmed than men in five areas that are agricultural production; food security; health; water and energy; and, climate-related disasters, migration, and conflict.

""Women are not helpless victims of climate change. They are powerful agents of change…But, if the impact of climate change on women goes unaddressed, globally, we will find the gender equality and Women’s Empowerment 2030 agenda going backwards to where it was in 2010,"" the NCW president warned.

In that realm, she presented the initiatives and programmes undertaken by Egypt to empower women, starting with Hayah Karima (Decent Life initiative), which is targeted at 58 million citizens in rural areas, showcasing that it has at the center the enhancement of the socio-economic conditions of women.

With regard to healthcare in specific, Maya Morsi stated that the Egyptian Women's Health Initiative had reached more than 23 million female beneficiaries.

Other initiatives inclusive of women are The National Egyptian Family Development Programme, aiming for the improvement of demographic characteristics and quality of life of families in more than 20 governorates, allowing for more resilient communities on the local level in Egypt.

In addition, women made 1,000 submissions to the National Initiative for Green Smart Projects. In a similar context, Egypt has launched “Noura,” which is a framework for investing in young girls."
0695bb63-ad2e-4d9e-bba0-8378c3f54d07,"The initiative aims to get cash quickly to communities in low-income countries struck by climate disaster. But critics call it a ""distraction"" from a real loss and damage fund.

Germany will provide €170 million ($172 million) to a ""Global Shield"" insurance initiative to help low-income and vulnerable countries to rebound in the event of climate calamities.

It aims to strengthen social protection schemes and climate risk insurance , so when an extreme weather event like flooding strikes, communities can access aid quickly and recover, said Germany's ministry for economic development and cooperation (BMZ).

""If there is no protection scheme in place, a drought can mean that a smallholder farmer loses not only her harvest but also her entire livelihood because she cannot afford to buy new seeds,"" said the ministry in a statement.

A protection scheme that ""kicks in automatically in the case of a crisis"" frees up money for new seeds immediately, limiting the damage, the statement continued.

Countries like Canada, Ireland and Denmark have so far pledged a further €40 million to the initiative.

Is insurance the best tool to address loss and damage?

But critics question whether an initiative with insurance at its core makes sense when places could become ""uninsurable"" due to worsening extreme weather and multiplying disasters.

""The insurance product will not be feasible. If I get into car accidents every other day, I will be blacklisted by the company,"" said Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy at Climate Action Network, an organization that brings together thousands of NGOs.

Details on how the initiative will work, where the money will go, and how it will get to the people who need it are so far ""very vague and very opaque,"" added Singh.

The initiative was officially launched by the G7 and the V20 group of 58 climate vulnerable nations at the COP27 climate summit in Egypt. US President Joe Biden announced the US would support the ""Global Shield"" during his COP27 speech on Friday.

Global Shield addresses loss and damage

The BMZ said Global South countries have contributed little to global emissions yet face the worst consequences of a warming world. At the same time, they don't have the resources to protect citizens.

At the same time, said the BMZ, industrialized countries like Germany need to ""honestly address"" climate-related loss and damage as major emitters.

""Germany stands by its responsibility to support poor and vulnerable people and countries in dealing with loss and damage,"" said Germany's development minister Svenja Schulze in a statement.



COP27: Developing nations demand urgent action To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video

Countries most vulnerable to destructive consequences of climate-related disasters, like the deadly flooding that hit Pakistan in the summer, want top polluters to pay for loss and damage.

""My country, Pakistan, has seen floods that have left 33 million lives in tatters and have caused loss and damage amounting to 10% of the GDP,"" said Munir Akram, outgoing chair of the G77 group of 134 developing countries at the COP.

After years of resistance from big emitters worried about being held liable for too much money, a special loss and damage fund is on the official summit agenda for the first time.

The ""Global Shield"" initiative is one step to address such funding, with Ghana finance minister and V20 chair Kenneth Nana Yaw Ofori-Atta calling it ""long overdue.""

""It has never been a question of who pays for loss and damage because we are paying for it,"" said Ofori-Atta. ""Our economies pay for it in lost growth prospects, our enterprises pay for it in business disruption, and our communities pay for it in lives and livelihoods lost.""

Since 2000, V20 states have lost around $525 billion to climate impacts. As those disasters escalate, the V20 risks getting further into debt because much of the climate financing ear-marked for low-income countries comes in the form of loans.

V20 research also found that 1.5 billion people in their countries do not have any financial protection like insurance. Ofori-Atta said that focusing on insurance would help those countries avoid increasing their debt.

The V20's debt payments alone are about half a trillion US dollars over the next four years.

Sara Ahmed, finance advisor to the V20, told DW that subsidies for premiums make insurance more affordable.

""But at the same time, climate change is accelerating the risks,"" Ahmed said from the summit. ""They're getting a lot worse, which means we have to shift our instruments and improve our instruments. And this is what the Global Shield intends to do.""

Insurance is not a 'silver bullet' for climate vulnerable nations

But Singh from Climate Action Network said what countries need is a clear loss and damage funding mechanism. Insurance doesn't cover slow onset events that cause serious damage like sea level rise or desertification, he added.

It also often pays out too little in a disaster, or doesn't pay out at all, said Singh. According to a DW analysis from 2018, climate risk insurance in Africa payouts covered 9.4% of climate-related damage.

Insurance alone also won't be enough to cover the yearly economic costs of loss and damage that could run into trillions by 2050.

""In case of responding to climate disasters, the role of insurance is very, very limited. Insurance takes a huge part of a huge space in these discussions,"" said Singh. ""I'm not against insurance, but it is being projected as a silver bullet.""

'Global Shield' is a 'good start' on loss and damage

David Ryfisch from Bonn-based environmental NGO Germanwatch said that the ""Global Shield"" is a ""genuine attempt to really move the needle on finance.""

He added that while insurance is a key component of the initiative, it also includes a natural disaster clause that will kick in to pause a country's climate loans in certain circumstances. The repayment money could be used for disaster relief instead.

Additionally, the V20 nations have established a loss and damage funding program and some ""Global Shield"" finance will flow into that.

""That's an interesting and important development because lots of NGOs were critical about the fact that this is an insurance scheme,"" said Ryfisch. ""But it has become a way more diverse set of instruments that the Global Shield is supposed to cover.""

The money dedicated so far is a ""good start,"" added Ryfisch, but in terms of the ""magnitude that we're looking at of expected loss and damage, it's really just a kick-starter.""

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Pakistan, Ghana and Bangladesh will be among the first recipients of funding from a G7 'Global Shield' initiative to provide funding to countries suffering climate disasters, the programme announced on Monday at the COP27 summit in Egypt.

The Global Shield, coordinated by G7 president Germany, aims to provide rapid access for climate-vulnerable countries to insurance and disaster protection funding after floods or drought. It is being developed in collaboration with the 'V20' group of 58 climate vulnerable economies.

A statement issued by Germany on Monday listed Bangladesh, Costa Rica, Fiji, Ghana, Pakistan, the Philippines and Senegal as some of the initial recipients of Global Shield packages.

Those packages would be developed in the coming months, Germany said.

386d414e-a17b-4c5a-93ee-f603f770c517,"The G7-led plan aims to rapidly provide prearranged insurance and protection funding after devastating events occur.

A G7-led plan dubbed “Global Shield” to provide funding to countries suffering climate disasters has been launched at the United Nations COP27 summit, although some questioned the effectiveness of the planned scheme.

Coordinated by Group of Seven president Germany and the Vulnerable Twenty (V20) group of climate-vulnerable countries, the plan launched on Monday aims to rapidly provide prearranged insurance and disaster protection funding after events such as floods, droughts and hurricanes hit.

Backed by 170 million euros ($175m) in funding from Germany and 40 million euros ($41m) from other donors including Denmark and Ireland, the Global Shield will in the next few months develop support to be deployed in countries including Pakistan, Ghana, Fiji and Senegal when events occur.

Some countries and campaigners were cautious, however, concerned that the plan risked damaging efforts to secure a substantive deal on financial help for so-called “loss and damage” – the UN jargon for irreparable damage wrought by global warming.

German Development Minister Svenja Schulze said the Global Shield aimed to complement, not replace, progress on loss and damage.

“It is not a kind of tactic to avoid formal negotiation on loss and damage funding arrangements here,” Schulze said. “Global Shield isn’t the one and only solution for loss and damage. Certainly not. We need a broad range of solutions.”

Some research suggests that by 2030, vulnerable countries could face $580bn per year in climate-linked “loss and damage”.

Ghana’s Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta, who chairs the V20 group of vulnerable countries, called the creation of the Global Shield “long overdue”.

“It has never been a question of who pays for loss and damage, because we are paying for it,” he said in recorded remarks at the summit in the Egyptian resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh.

“Our economies pay for it in lost growth prospects, our enterprises pay for it in business disruption, and our communities pay for it in lives and livelihoods lost.”

‘We are not yet persuaded’

Yet some vulnerable countries questioned the scheme’s focus on insurance, with insurance premiums adding another cost to cash-strapped countries that have low carbon emissions and contributed least to the causes of climate change.

“We are not yet persuaded, especially of the insurance elements,” Avinash Persaud, the special envoy on climate finance to Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley, told the Reuters news agency.

“Using insurance is a method in which the victim pays, just in installments in the beginning,” he said, adding that loss and damage finance should be grant-based.

It was not immediately clear how much of the Global Shield funding announced so far was in grant form.

Michai Robertson, a negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States – which is championing calls for a new UN loss and damage fund in the talks this week – said even subsidised insurance premiums could enable insurance companies in wealthy countries to profit off poor and vulnerable nations’ suffering.

“There’s an inherent injustice about them profiting off of our loss and damage,” he said.

‘Life and death’

A formal loss and damage funding stream would likely go further, also covering longer-onset climate impacts such as sea level rise and threats to cultural heritage.

The V20 bloc, made up of 58 developing nations, released research this year that estimated countries had lost some $525bn to climate impacts since 2000.

Ninety-eight percent of the nearly 1.5 billion people in V20 countries do not have financial protection, it said.

“We’re talking about people living under the poverty line; they’re not going to be buying insurance,” Rachel Cleetus, lead economist at the Union of Concerned Scientists’ climate programme, told the AFP news agency.

“Insurance can help you up to a point but climate change is now creating conditions in many parts of the world that are beyond the bounds of what’s insurable,” she said, referring to sea level rise, desertification and the mass displacement of populations.

Teresa Anderson of ActionAid International said the scheme showed that the global community recognised the need to act on loss and damage, but said it was a “distraction” from negotiations on a dedicated funding mechanism for climate damages.

“Everyone knows that insurance companies, by their very nature, are either reluctant to provide coverage, or reluctant to pay out,” she said.

“But when it comes to loss and damage, this is a matter of life and death.”"
bd4c7497-332a-4b57-9672-c5c8e1343103,"It was the $100bn question during COP26 last year: would rich countries fulfil their pledge to give that sum to poorer states of the global south, to address climate change. In 2009, they said they would do so by 2020. But the figure was not achieved — falling short at $83.3bn, and Oxfam calculates that most of this was provided as loans, rather than grants.

At COP27 in Egypt this month, discussion will once again be dominated by rifts over climate finance. African ministers have called the failure to provide the promised money “shameful”.

And, even if $100bn is delivered, leaders in the global south argue it is insufficient, particularly when most climate-vulnerable countries are already mired in debt and still grappling with the economic fallout from Covid-19.

“Developing countries have to balance between urgent climate needs and paying back debts,” says Jessica Omukuti, research fellow at the University of Oxford’s Inclusive Net Zero initiative. “If you can’t pay back your debts, your credit rating goes down, [and] you compromise your partnerships and your future capacity to get finance.”

More than half of the world’s poorest countries are either in debt distress or at high risk of it, according to the World Bank. Poorer countries bear the brunt of environmental degradation and are simultaneously unable to meet the cost of low-carbon and climate-resilient development.

Research by the campaigning group Debt Justice found they spend five times more on debt payments than on dealing with climate change, resulting in a vicious circle of climate catastrophe, borrowing, and spiralling debt burdens.

The climate crisis is driving poor countries further into debt distress, says Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland and chair of The Elders, an independent group of global leaders. “As Mia Mottley [Barbados prime minister] said, in many places like the Caribbean, climate and other natural disasters account for 50 per cent of the long increase in public debt there. And that’s typical.”

Pakistan is a recent case in point. Fierce flooding in the summer ravaged the country, displacing 33mn people, killing more than 1,400, and costing around $40bn in property damage. The IMF approved a bailout loan of more than $1.1bn but, last month, Pakistan’s government announced it would need to borrow billions more. The country already has external debt of around $130bn.

Debt crises in poor countries are often triggered by extreme climate events. In 2019, Mozambique took on a $118mn loan from the IMF to deal with the aftermath of cyclone Kenneth and cyclone Idai. Decades earlier, Belize’s debt doubled from 47 per cent of GDP in 1999 to 96 per cent by 2003, following devastating storms in 2000 and 2001.

Increasing climate threats make lending to vulnerable countries more risky, so borrowing becomes more expensive

Nearly three-quarters of climate finance still comes in the form of loans, usually with high interest. A 2020 Oxfam report revealed that as much as 80 per cent of funds gathered for the $100bn pot came as loans and, of that, about half was in the form of non-concessional loans: those offered on ungenerous terms.

Increasing climate threats make lending to vulnerable countries more risky, so borrowing becomes more expensive. But, equally, as the intensity and frequency of extreme weather escalates, vulnerable countries desperately need cash for adaptation, yet only a quarter of climate finance in 2019 was spent on adaptation, according to the OECD.

Some in the global south argue that, because they bear little responsibility for the climate chaos wrecking their nations, debts should be cancelled and the global north should pay reparations for the damage it has caused.

Demands are also growing for a “loss and damage” fund to help low-income countries deal with climate-related devastation, though so far most developed nations have sidestepped the issue.

Members of V20, a bloc of 20 countries among the most vulnerable to climate change, are considering halting debt payments. Between them, they owe $500bn over the next four years. Leading the charge, Mohamad Nasheed, former president of the Maldives, said poor nations were locked in a Sisyphean trap: borrowing money to ward off storms, only to see climate change destroy the improvements.

There are potential solutions. Thinkers in the Caribbean, Germany and elsewhere have proposed debt-for-adaptation swaps: creditors would forgo debt repayments so that the funds could instead be spent locally on adaptation. This would boost domestic economies, eliminate the search for hard currency to repay loans, and spur climate resilience.

Similar debt swaps have worked in Seychelles, Poland and Argentina. The Bridgetown Initiative, unveiled by Mottley in September, puts forward a number of proposals to transform international financing, including natural disaster clauses in every debt contract, more concessional funding, and expanding the lending capacity of multilateral development banks (MDBs).

“We need all the possibilities,” says Robinson. Securing the promised $100bn is important because it has become a trust issue, she says, but there also needs to be “a real pathway to doubling climate adaptation finance” and “debt swaps for adaptation and nature”.

“Above all else, we need to work out how to open the coffers of the MDBs. There’s so much capital available. It’s the political will that’s the problem.”

LONDON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Britain plans to offer new loans to support countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, including the option to defer debt repayments in the event of catastrophes, the finance ministry said on Tuesday.

The country's export credit agency, UK Export Finance (UKEF), will provide such loans to low-income countries and small island developing states, according to the Treasury.

Details of the plans will be given at the COP27 climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, where discussion between world leaders have so far focused on the need for wealthier countries to do more to help developing nations dealing with the worst effects of global warming.

""I am proud that UK Export Finance is the first export credit agency in the world to offer loans which suspend debt service payments for countries hit by climate catastrophes and natural disasters,"" junior finance minister James Cartlidge said in a statement.

The proposals would allow vulnerable countries to defer debt repayments to free up resources to fund disaster relief, the ministry said.

Months after torrential rain and fast-melting glaciers submerged a third of Pakistan, parts of the country’s southern Sindh and Balochistan provinces still resemble an inland sea.

“There are places where, as far as the eye can see, you still see water,” said Farah Naureen, Pakistan country director for aid agency Mercy Corps.

The disaster has left thousands of families camped out in tents on elevated roadsides, first battling scorching summer heat with little shade – and now needing protection to deal with the winter cold, she said.

But just a fifth of an $800-million United Nations aid appeal for the country has been covered so far.

With 25,000 schools and millions of homes, plus health facilities and farm fields, needing repairs – adding up to damage estimated at $30-billion – “recovery is going to be very challenging,” Ms. Naureen said.

At the COP27 UN climate summit in Egypt, a range of new efforts to limit such “loss and damage” – and get disaster-hit countries back on their feet more quickly – are being proposed.

On Monday, Germany and other G7 countries, alongside Ghana and the V20 group of vulnerable countries, unveiled plans to launch a “Global Shield” against climate risks.

It brings together and expands initiatives – from subsidized insurance coverage to stronger social protection schemes and pre-approved disaster financing – aimed at ensuring international help arrives swiftly to support disaster-hit poorer countries’ own contingency plans.

It builds in part on the InsuResilience Global Partnership, an insurance program launched in 2017 that now operates in 108 countries, with flagship projects such as the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility and African Risk Capacity pool.

The idea is to get money moving as countries negotiate on setting up a more comprehensive “loss and damage” funding facility, a major focus at COP27.

“We thought it was so urgent to get something up and running now, while we work globally” through the UN system, said Jennifer Morgan, state secretary and special envoy for international climate action in Germany’s foreign ministry.

The “Global Shield” would complement a proposed “loss and damage” finance facility – not replace it, she said in an interview.

The shield aims to fill current gaps in protection to ensure money arrives within 24 to 48 hours after a disaster, and will be up and running from January 2023, said Ms. Morgan, a long-time climate policy expert and former head of Greenpeace.

But climate activists at COP27 said they believed some wealthier G7 countries are positioning the Global Shield as a substitute for a new loss and damage fund.

Some wealthy-country diplomats have suggested at COP27 that a “mosaic” of protection and disaster response finance could be an alternative to a loss and damage facility, which is opposed by the United States and some other major polluters.

“It’s a power game. They want to control the money,” said Harjeet Singh, a loss and damage specialist with Climate Action Network International, which represents more than 1,900 non-governmental groups.

Svenja Schulze, Germany’s federal minister for economic co-operation and development, representing the G7 nations, said the Global Shield was not “the one and only solution for loss and damage,” and would not deal with things such as non-economic losses of culture or slow-onset problems such as sea level rise.

But she and others emphasized the need to “build on existing structures and bring them together so we can act faster” on worsening disasters.

Sara Ahmed, the V20’s finance adviser, would not comment directly on whether a separate loss and damage fund should be established, noting only that “we cannot wait another two years” for help to be delivered.

The COP27 climate negotiations are tasked with finding a “concrete” way to deal with rising climate losses for the world’s most vulnerable countries by 2024 at the latest.

The Global Shield has so far raised $200-million in new funding, largely from Germany, with backers planning to work with vulnerable countries to create tailored packages of help.

But Teresa Anderson, global lead on climate justice for ActionAid International, warned that insurance, in particular, cannot keep up with swiftly rising climate-related losses.

“An initiative that involves Northern countries subsidizing Northern-owned insurance corporations should not be mistaken for loss and damage finance that supports communities on the front lines of the climate crisis,” she said.

Sherry Rehman, Pakistan’s Climate Change Minister, said faster help for countries such as hers is crucial in whatever form.

“We are not asking for reparations. We are not even asking for compensation,” she said on the sidelines of the UN talks.

But crises “need to be responded to with speed, agility and scale,” she added.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres called at COP27 for the whole world to be covered by early warning systems within five years.

Today, only a third of small island developing states and under half of least-developed countries have access to systems designed to give alerts about impending storms, floods, tsunamis and other threats, the UN says.

Mami Mizutori, head of the UN disaster risk reduction agency, said putting effective protection systems in place globally is “ambitious” but “we need to do it.”

“Every day we fail to do it, more lives are lost,” she said, noting that countries with good early warning systems have eight times lower mortality from disasters.

Warnings delivered at least 24 hours before a disaster strikes can also cut economic losses by 30 per cent, she said at COP27.

Such stepped-up protection measures are particularly important as international humanitarian funding runs short in the face of mounting global crises.

Gernot Laganda, director of climate and disaster risk reduction for the UN World Food Programme (WFP), said his agency had long put a share of its financing toward efforts to build resilience in communities and prevent losses rather than simply responding to them, which is much more costly.

That includes providing cash a few days ahead of an expected flood, to help families buy emergency food supplies and move their animals and possessions to higher ground, and advising drought-hit herders to bring animals to market early.

But as demand for immediate aid to feed crisis-hit families soars alongside droughts, floods and now the war in Ukraine, “the prevention agenda, the resilience agenda, is going to be left behind,” Mr. Laganda warned in an interview.

“We need this radical [prevention] effort now to brace for impact” from fast-worsening climate disasters, he added.

Ms. Naureen, of Mercy Corps, said early warning systems had let Pakistanis know before the floods that monsoon rains would be heavier than usual, but “nothing could have prepared Pakistan for a disaster of this scale.”

That situation makes the push to win a funding facility to help communities recover from now-inevitable loss and damage crucial, alongside prevention efforts such as early warning and the Global Shield, she said.

“When there is no money for loss and damage, somebody is bearing that cost. The loss doesn’t go away, the need doesn’t go away. The people affected end up bearing the cost,” she said.

“If we can’t support them in a timely way, we’re pushing them into further poverty and misery.”"

LONDON (Reuters) - Countries hit by climate change-driven disasters such as flooding and hurricanes will automatically be able to freeze debt payments under new plans laid out by the bond market rule setting International Capital Market Association (ICMA).

Devastating flooding in Pakistan has pushed it to the brink of debt crisis in recent weeks and there are growing fears that far more countries will suffer more frequent catastrophes as global warming continues.

ICMA's move on Wednesday introduced new ""climate resilient debt clauses"" (CDRCs) that countries can now plug into the government bonds they sell to raise money on the international capital markets.

They are the result of a UK-convened working group that included G7 governments as well as the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and major U.S and European banks, investment firms and lawyers.

Any country that uses them will be able to defer their debt payments for a maximum of 2 years, with the aim of giving them enough financial breathing space to provide aid and support to affected populations.

""As well as supporting disaster resilience by freeing up cash flow, CRDCs could help avoid the liquidity challenges faced by low-income countries in such circumstances becoming costly payment defaults,"" ICMA said.

CRDCs are already used in Caribbean countries like Barbados and Granada which are regularly battered by hurricanes. The hope of the working group is that other nations in the Pacific, Africa and Central and Southeast Asia will now use them too.

ICMA said while technically no country is excluded from using CRDCs, they were likely to be most suitable for low-income countries, Small Island Developing States, or other developing countries particularly vulnerable to climate change.

Leland Goss, ICMA’s General Counsel said the hope is that they will be timely with a wave of countries now facing debt crises in the wake of the COVID pandemic and sharply rising debt levels and interest rates.

6d894aab-f2d7-411f-8d7c-ff34c431df83,"LONDON, Nov 9 (Reuters) – Countries hit by climate change-driven disasters such as flooding and hurricanes will automatically be able to freeze debt payments under new plans laid out by the bond market rule setting International Capital Market Association (ICMA).

Devastating flooding in Pakistan has pushed it to the brink of debt crisis in recent weeks and there are growing fears that far more countries will suffer more frequent catastrophes as global warming continues.

ICMA’s move on Wednesday introduced new “climate resilient debt clauses” (CDRCs) that countries can now plug into the government bonds they sell to raise money on the international capital markets.

They are the result of a UK-convened working group that included G7 governments as well as the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and major U.S and European banks, investment firms and lawyers.

Any country that uses them will be able to defer their debt payments for a maximum of 2 years, with the aim of giving them enough financial breathing space to provide aid and support to affected populations.

“As well as supporting disaster resilience by freeing up cash flow, CRDCs could help avoid the liquidity challenges faced by low-income countries in such circumstances becoming costly payment defaults,” ICMA said.

CRDCs are already used in Caribbean countries like Barbados and Granada which are regularly battered by hurricanes. The hope of the working group is that other nations in the Pacific, Africa and Central and Southeast Asia will now use them too.

ICMA said while technically no country is excluded from using CRDCs, they were likely to be most suitable for low-income countries, Small Island Developing States, or other developing countries particularly vulnerable to climate change.

Leland Goss, ICMA’s General Counsel said the hope is that they will be timely with a wave of countries now facing debt crises in the wake of the COVID pandemic and sharply rising debt levels and interest rates.

As well as flooding and hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis and droughts would all be covered by the clauses.

“If sovereign borrowers can avoid default at the time of a natural catastrophe, this will benefit both affected countries but also their creditors and the global financial system,” Goss said."

The G7 has launched a new fund to help countries hit by climate disasters recover more quickly but sceptics have warned it should not be a “distraction” to commitments on loss and damage compensation.

The scheme launched on Monday during the Cop27 summit in Egypt’s Sharm el-Sheikh aims to provide climate risk insurance and pre-arranged disaster finance for countries most at risk, with Pakistan, Ghana and Bangladesh set to be among the first recipients.

Led by Germany, the world’s seven biggest economies, the G7, and the group of 58 climate-vulnerable nations, referred to as V20, launched the new fund after months of talks. It is set to kick off as early as next year.

Germany said the funding would look to strengthen social protection schemes and climate risk insurance so communities can access aid and recover quickly when an extreme weather event, such as flooding, strikes.

“If there is no protection scheme in place, a drought can mean that a smallholder farmer loses not only her harvest but also her entire livelihood because she cannot afford to buy new seeds,” Germany’s ministry for economic development and cooperation (BMZ) said in a statement.

Countries such as Canada, Ireland and Denmark have so far pledged €40 million to the initiative. US President Joe Biden also announced the US would support the “Global Shield” initiative during his Cop27 speech on Friday.

But critics question whether an initiative with insurance at its core makes sense when places could become “uninsurable” due to worsening extreme weather and multiplying disasters.

ActionAid International labelled the fund a “distraction” that should not be mistaken for loss and damage funding.

“At Cop27 there’s huge pressure on rich countries to agree to a financing facility on loss and damage, so that communities on the front lines of the climate crisis can rebuild and recover after disasters,” Teresa Anderson, Global Lead on Climate Justice for ActionAid International said.

“While the Global Shield initiative is a sign that countries recognise the need to do something, this is a distraction.”

“Everyone knows that insurance companies, by their very nature, are either reluctant to provide coverage, or reluctant to pay out. But when it comes to loss and damage this is a matter of life and death,” she adds.

“An initiative that involves northern countries subsidising northern-owned insurance corporations should not be mistaken for loss and damage finance that supports communities on the front lines of the climate crisis.”

Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy at Climate Action Network (CAN) International and a vocal voice for loss and damage finance, expressed similar scepticism over the new insurance-based finance.

“The Global Shield cannot be hyped up as a solution to address the increasing scale of floods, storms and droughts, fuelled by climate change,” he said.

“Disproportionate focus on a new mechanism that does not cover slow onset events such as rising sea levels or loss of language and culture cannot meet the needs of communities on the ground.”

“It cannot take away attention from the primary demand of developing countries for establishing a finance facility for loss and damage at Cop27.”

The loss and damage finance, which refers to the massive losses vulnerable countries are suffering due to increasing global warming that they can not adapt to, remains the top focus at this year’s climate talks.

Finance for vulnerable communities has been one of the biggest demands from poorer countries for over 20 decades, but the issue finally made it to this year’s agenda in what was considered a major step towards climate justice.

But as the summit enters its second and final week on Monday, observers warn that for the UN climate talks to be able to effectively address the issue of justice, the facility has to come in the form of grants and not loans and insurance.

On Monday, the Group of Seven leading economies launched an initiative called the “Global Shield” at the United Nations’ COP27 climate summit which will provide immediate funding to the countries when they are hit by the devastating impact of climate change.

Coordinated by the G7 president nation Germany, it will provide rapid access to funds for insurance and disaster protection after flooding, drought and hurricanes. The programme was developed in collaboration with ‘V20’ which is a group of 58 climate-vulnerable countries chaired by Ghana.

A statement was issued by Berlin, in which it named seven countries – Bangladesh, Costa Rica, Fiji, Ghana, Pakistan, the Philippines and Senegal, as the first recipients of packages, which would be developed in the upcoming months. So far, Germany has contributed $175.17 million in funding to Global Shield while other countries including Denmark and Ireland have contributed a little over $41 million.

The first draft released on Monday reportedly highlighted two major points – the divide between rich and poor nations, while the V20 countries proposed that this fund should not be “operationalised” by November 2024.

While some countries have been wary that it risked efforts to secure a substantive deal on financial help for so-called “loss and damage”, Germany’s economic cooperation and development minister Svenja Schulze said that the aim with these funds is to add to but not replace the progress on loss and damage.

“It is not a kind of tactic to avoid formal negotiation on loss and damage funding arrangements here…Global Shield isn't the one and only solution for loss and damage. Certainly not. We need a broad range of solutions,” said Schulze. However, some vulnerable countries are not yet persuaded as there is reportedly not a lot of clarity on the “insurance elements” of the deal.

“Using insurance is a method in which the victim pays, just in installments in the beginning,” said a special envoy on climate finance Avinash Persaud to the Prime Minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley, reported Reuters. He also said that the loss and damage finance should be grant-based.

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt (AP) — The Group of Seven leading economies launched a new insurance system Monday to provide swift financial aid when nations are hit by devastating effects of climate change.

“My friends, I came to the presidency determined to make … transformational changes that are needed, that America needs to make and we have to do for the rest of the world; to overcome decades of opposition and obstacles of progress on this issue alone, to re-establish the United States as a trustworthy and committed global leader on climate,” Biden said.

The new measures include pledging more than $200 million in funding for climate change resilience and adaptation in developing countries, and a new plan to reduce emissions of methane — an especially potent greenhouse gas — from oil and gas infrastructure.

“The climate crisis is about human security, economic security, environmental security, national security and the very life of the planet,” Biden said in a speech at the conference, known as COP27 and held this year in the resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. “So today, I’d like to share with you how the United States is meeting the climate crisis with urgency and with determination to ensure a cleaner, safer, healthier planet for all of us.”

Most of what Biden went on to share was a recapitulation of actions the administration has already taken, including significant investments in reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions through subsidies for clean energy sources, such as wind and solar power and electric vehicles, included in the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act. These programs are projected to help cut U.S. emissions by 40% from 2005 levels by the end of this decade.

The U.S., however, had committed at previous climate conferences to cut emissions by 50% by 2030. In Glasgow, Scotland, last year, Biden administration officials and congressional Democrats in attendance boasted of the president’s “Build Back Better” bill, which included more expansive climate change components and would have put the U.S. on track to meet the 50% target. Although the House of Representatives passed the measure shortly after delegates met in Glasgow in November 2021, it subsequently died in the Senate. The Inflation Reduction Act, a curtailed version of the Build Back Better initiative, left out or scaled back the prior legislation’s most ambitious climate programs.

Story continues

Still, the Inflation Reduction Act was the first major law passed in the U.S. to address the climate crisis. The Biden administration now hopes to bridge the gap between that law and its prior emissions commitments through additional regulatory measures. These include the new methane rule proposal from the Environmental Protection Agency, which was announced to coincide with Biden’s address, as well as actions by states and the private sector.

During the president’s speech Friday, the most enthusiastic response from the audience came when he pledged that the U.S. would still live up to its word on meeting emissions cuts.

“I can say with confidence, the United States will meet our emissions targets by 2030,” he said to sustained applause.

Cognizant of the developing world’s concern over whether the U.S. will also commit to helping poorer countries develop economies based on clean energy, Biden emphasized that the Inflation Reduction Act will not only reduce American emissions but make cleaner technologies more affordable globally. The new focus on expanding the technology should help industry introduce economies of scale and increase technical breakthroughs, he said.

“[The bill] will spark a cycle of innovation that will reduce the cost and increase the availability of clean energy technology that will be available to countries worldwide, not just the United States,” he said. “It will accelerate decarbonization beyond our borders.”

As has often been the case at recent climate change conferences, the actions of Biden’s climate-science-denying predecessor, former President Donald Trump, cast a shadow on the proceedings. Biden was interrupted by applause when he noted that his administration had “immediately rejoined the Paris [climate] agreement” upon taking office. Referring in an apparent ad lib to his predecessor's decision to withdraw the U.S. from the climate pact, Biden said, “I apologize we ever pulled out of the agreement.”

Delegates from developing nations have been pushing wealthy countries to increase climate aid, and the question of how much the U.S. and its allies will step up is a focus of tension at this year’s conference. Biden rehashed an array of assistance programs his administration has recently launched to help developing nations adapt to and prepare for the effects of climate change, which, he acknowledged, disproportionately harm poorer countries. For instance, he noted that the White House announced in late September that the U.S. will provide $22 million in assistance to small island nations in the Pacific Ocean to monitor weather and ocean data and project the impact of climate change.

The president also had some new contributions to tout. The Biden administration announced a new commitment of $13.6 million Friday to “help fill weather, water, and climate observation gaps in Africa” and $15 million to help Africa meet U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres’s goal of ensuring that within five years, the entire world be covered by an early warning system for climate-change-related natural disasters.

Some environmental activists, such as Jean Su, a director at the Center for Biological Diversity, considered those commitments inadequate, and called on Biden to commit to U.S. funding for loss and damage, which would establish a fund with contributions from nations or corporations that have grown rich from fossil fuels to help compensate developing countries for the destruction caused by climate change.

“The call for loss-and-damage funding at this conference has been louder than ever before, so it’s disturbing that Biden was silent on paying off the tremendous debt the United States owes as the world’s largest historical climate polluter,” Su said.

Yet there are clear limits for how much U.S. funding Biden can commit without new congressional appropriation. Should Republicans retake control of the House of Representatives, that prospect will be further diminished. Last year, the United Nations projected that total climate finance for adaptation in developing countries will require $140 billion to $300 billion per year by 2030.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who traveled to Egypt with a congressional delegation, signaled her support for Biden’s climate agenda, but it is not clear whether she will still be speaker in January, pending the outcome of the midterm elections.

The president did have new domestic climate actions to announce, however. Earlier in the day, the administration issued the new proposed rule for curbing methane leakage in oil and gas wells and pipelines. The initial U.S. proposal made at COP26 in Glasgow had loopholes, including inadequate inspections of old wells, according to such experts as David Doniger, senior strategic director of the Climate and Clean Energy Program of the Natural Resources Defense Council. The new measure attempts to close them and will probably be more effective, Doniger told Yahoo News.

“The EPA is proposing new limits to cut the U.S. oil and gas industry’s unchecked emissions of this dangerous climate pollutant,” he said in a statement. “By cutting pollution from routine flaring, requiring regular monitoring and repair at all leak-prone wells and incorporating third party leak monitoring into EPA enforcement, the EPA is moving to cut climate pollution and protect the health and wellbeing of communities nationwide.”

By Valerie Volcovici

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt - (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden's administration plans to toughen a crackdown on oil and gas industry methane leaks as part of a ""relentless focus"" on preventing planet-warming emissions, officials said on Friday at the COP27 climate talks.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it will expand its 2021 methane rule so that it requires drillers to find and plug leaks at all of the country's well sites, and not just the biggest ones, defying months of lobbying from drillers.

White House National Climate Adviser Ali Zaidi, speaking at the conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, said the planned crackdown on methane, which is among the most powerful greenhouse gases, was part of the Biden administration’s “relentless focus on making sure we root out emissions everywhere we can find them.”

The oil and gas industry is a large source of methane, which tends to leak into the atmosphere undetected from drill sites, gas pipelines and other equipment.

The EPA last year announced a proposal to address the problem by requiring oil and gas operators to monitor 300,000 of its biggest well sites quarterly to find and fix leaks.

The new plan would extend that by requiring monitoring of all the country’s roughly 1 million well sites, the EPA said.

It would also force methane emissions reductions from flaring equipment and create a system to detect leaks from ""super-emitter"" sites quickly so operators can repair them faster and local community residents are aware.

Although short-lived compared with carbon dioxide, methane is responsible for around a quarter of planetary warming so far, making it a target for policy-makers seeking to combat climate change.

The EPA said the stronger rules would reduce methane from the oil and gas industry by 87% below 2005 levels and would help the United States to meet its commitment under the Global Methane Pledge to cut methane emissions economy-wide by 30% this decade.

Last year, the United States and the European Union spearheaded the Global Methane Pledge, which has drawn the participation of 119 countries.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and American Chamber of Commerce, which represent U.S. business interests, said in a joint statement they supported efforts to cut methane, but the new rules needed to consider ""heightened concerns associated with energy supply, reliability, and affordability.""

Environmental groups welcomed the EPA's announcement, while maintaining pressure on the administration to transition the economy away from oil and gas.

""Even the best methane reduction plan will be irrelevant if fossil fuels keep expanding, so the president needs to act now,"" said Jean Su, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Energy Justice program.

OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY LOBBYING

The oil and gas industry had urged the agency to exclude hundreds of thousands of low-producing wells on the grounds frequent monitoring would be inefficient and costly.

Studies from the Department of Energy and from environmental group EDF, however, showed that more than half of methane emitted from U.S. well sites comes from wells that produce less than 15 barrels a day.

""We believe the rule was fair in that aspect,” U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan said, adding he believed the monitoring would be affordable.

In a concession to the industry, the EPA said it would provide oil and gas companies flexibility around the kinds of technology they can use to monitor their sites for leaks. Also, it did not impose an outright ban on flaring, as some environmental groups had requested.

Regan told a news conference the practice of burning off excess gas from drill sites would only be permitted under the proposal if operators can prove they cannot feasibly get it to market or reinject it into the ground.

The new plan also creates a program to detect the biggest methane emitting sites using government data or remote technology, and then notifies the owner to prompt a quick repair.

That program would make information about leaks - and company responses to them - public. It dovetailed with a U.N. announcement on Friday that it will launch a global public database of methane leaks detected by space satellites to encourage companies and governments to plug them.

The EPA will take public input on the methane rule until Feb. 13, 2023 and plans to finalize it by the end of that year.

If the proposal is implemented, the EPA estimates that it will yield total net climate benefits of $3.1 to $3.2 billion per year from 2023 to 2035, taking into account compliance and savings from recovered natural gas.

The rule, however, could be undone if a Republican wins the 2024 presidential election and decides to reverse it.

dd9a9b57-f4cc-4966-9359-a2b90b8bb331,"United States President Joe Biden has told the COP27 climate conference in Egypt that global warming poses an existential threat to the planet and promised the US would meet its targets for fighting it.

His speech was intended to pump up global ambition to prevent the worst of climate change, even as a slew of other crises - from a land war in Europe to rampant inflation - distract international focus.

""The climate crisis is about human security, economic security, environmental security, national security, and the very life of the planet,"" Biden told a crowded room of delegates at the United Nations summit in the seaside resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh.

""I can stand here as president of the United States of America and say with confidence, the United States of America will meet our emissions targets by 2030,"" he said, outlining steps being taken by the world's second-biggest greenhouse gas emitter.

Prior to his arrival, Biden's administration unveiled a domestic plan to crack down on the US oil and gas industry's emissions of methane, one of the most powerful greenhouse gases.

The move defied months of lobbying by drillers.

The US and the European Union also issued a joint declaration alongside Japan, Canada, Norway, Singapore and the United Kingdom pledging more action on oil industry methane.

That declaration was meant to build on an international deal launched last year and since signed by about 130 countries to cut economy-wide emissions 30 per cent this decade.

""Cutting methane by at least 30 per cent by 2030 can be our best chance keep within reach 1.5C,"" Biden said, referring to the central goal of the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit the global temperature rise.

Biden said global crises, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine, were not an excuse to lower climate ambition.

""Against this backdrop, it's more urgent than ever that we double down on our climate commitments. Russia's war only enhances the urgency of the need to transition the world off its dependence on fossil fuels,"" he said.

During his speech, Biden also promised an increase in funding to help other countries embrace the energy transition and adapt and prepare for the impacts of a warmer world.

That issue has been a sore point at the talks; wealthy countries have so far failed to fully deliver $US100 billion ($A149 billion) promised annually for climate adaptation.

Last year's transfer came to only about $US83 billion ($A124 billion).

""He announced a slew of new climate programs, but he couldn't deliver what the developing world most wants - enough money to adapt to climate extremes,"" said Alice Hill of the Climate Crisis Advisory Group and a former US official under the administration of Barack Obama."

With control of the U.S. Congress still unclear after Tuesday's midterm elections, there is little that U.S. President Joe Biden can offer.

NEW YORK, Nov. 11 (Xinhua) -- During the ongoing United Nations climate summit in Egypt, developing nations have been excoriating the United States and other industrialized nations for causing climate change and demanding reparations, reported The New York Times on Thursday.

This is ""a call that some European leaders have begun to answer with monetary pledges,"" squeezing U.S. President Joe Biden to do the same, said the report.

French President Emmanuel Macron was quoted as saying that Europe was already helping poorer countries, and that other Western nations needed to do more. ""We are the only ones paying,"" he said.

""Pressure must be put on rich non-European countries, telling them, 'You have to pay your fair share,'"" Macron said, in a not-too-veiled reference to the Americans, according to the report.

But with control of the U.S. Congress still unclear after Tuesday's midterm elections, there is little that Biden can offer, said the report.

""If Republicans are in charge come January, there will be less money, not more, to help foreign nations cope with climate change, as well as fresh efforts to slow down or block the president's climate agenda,"" the report noted. ■"
8c80501c-10f4-4017-8eaa-e2022e5a0009,"The following statement is issued by the South Asian People’s Action on Climate Change (SAPACC), a rainbow coalition of individuals and organizations from Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka who are deeply concerned about the climate crisis.

Greenhouse gases (GHGs) have caused an observed average global warming of 1.1oC above pre-industrial temperatures. That global warming is due to anthropogenic carbon emissions, which grew exponentially after industrial capitalism struck deep roots in the 19th Century, has been known since 1896 when Svante Arrhenius published his computations on this subject. Since the early 20th Century scientists, to name a few–Callendar, Plass, Keeling, Lorenz, Emiliani, Manabe, Broecker, and Hansen, have warned the world of the grave dangers carbon emissions pose to the planet because they will the earth’s disturbed energy balance, weaken the thermohaline circulation, collapse Antarctic’s ice sheets, bleach of coral reefs, trigger extreme weather events and increase cyclonic storm frequencies and intensities. Thaw the permafrost, and consequently impact human society adversely.

The hydrocarbon industry, e.g., Exxon, BP, Chevron, and many governments of large carbon-emitting countries were aware of the risks of climate change for over half a century. Yet fossil fuel burning continued unabated till today to up the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) concentrations to ~420 ppm, which is 50% greater than pre-industrial times. To protect their business interests, a section of the hydro-carbon industry even funded global warming deniers.

Failure of the climate agreements

The Kyoto Protocol aimed to reduce developed countries’ (Annex 1 countries) emissions by 5.2% by 2012 over the base year 1990. Instead, during this period, the consumptive emissions of these countries increased by 14.5%. The primary emissions reduction instruments—the clean development mechanism (CDM) and joint implementation (JI) failed to deliver. Between 2008 and 2021, CDM projects theoretically prevented or removed emissions amounting to 2.16 GtCO 2 , constituting just 1.25% and 0.5% of the cumulative emissions of the Annex 1 countries and global emissions, respectively. Up to September 2021, JI had effected an emission reduction of 872 MtCO 2 , i.e., 0.5% of the cumulative emissions of the Annex 1 countries. Even if we presume that the CDM and JI worked well, they prevented or removed less than 2% of the cumulative emissions of Annex 1 countries, a fraction that is too small to make a difference.

There were other reasons for the CDM’s failure. The CDM did not deliver real, measurable, and more importantly, additional emissions reduction, i.e., emission reductions that happen solely due to the CDM. Studies done by the Oko Institute, Grantham Institute and Compensate show that a large number of projects were granted CDM status even though they would have effected emissions reduction without this status. In many projects, the declared emissions reduction was inflated, and some projects caused human rights violations. The inclusion of ‘sink’ projects, e.g., forestry, in the CDM undermined the effort to reduce emissions by the Annex 1 countries. Since certified emission reduction credits (CERs) under the CDM are market-tradable instruments, their demand and price fluctuated with economic swings. The 2008 economic slowdown reduced Europe’s emissions and consequently the demand for CERs.

The Paris Agreement has not worked, at least till now. In their latest report, Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis, released in August 2021, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, warns that to meet the ≤1.50C warming ambition, current emissions must be halved by 2030-35, and the world should become net carbon zero by 2050-55. That implies that emissions must be reduced by >7% per annum (pa) for the next 30 years. But global emissions have been growing by 1.2% pa since the 2015 Paris Agreement was signed.

Per the United Nations Environment Programme’s Emission Gap reports, the difference between projected emissions in 2030 considering national pledges to reduce emissions, and the desired ones to be ≤1.5oC compliant, known as the emissions gap, has increased by 33-35% between 2016 and 2022.

In the quarter century, since the Kyoto Protocol was signed, global energy consumption doubled to 14 Gtoe[1] in 2019, with fossil fuels and renewables contributing to 67% and 15% of the energy expansion, respectively, between 1997-2019 (see Table 1 in the Annex). renewable energy supplemented fossil fuels rather than replace them—a classic Jevon’s paradox. In the same period, the energy consumption of the Annex 1 countries remained constant at a little over 4 Gtoe, with just 0.3 Gtoe of fossil fuels being replaced by renewable energies—an unimpressive performance.

The low ambition of the largest GHG emitters, the odds at which climate science and policy are, and the failure of the market mechanisms have created an unenviable situation where we have 8 years left to halve our emissions. Instead of analysing the fundamental causes of climate change and its remedies, the 2021 Glasgow Conference of Parties (COP) 26 spent much time framing rules for the Paris Agreement’s market instruments that are akin to the failed ones under the Kyoto Protocol. The primary discourse in the COP meetings has ignored the fundamental role that anthropocentrism and privatization of nature have played in history in sanctifying and encouraging unbridled growth that is at the root of social inequality and unsustainability.

Our current emissions trajectory will cause an unbearable average global warming closer to 3oC by 2100 that will have catastrophic consequences for the environment and human society. India and the world are witnessing accelerated impacts-such as this year-at barely 0.8oC and 1.1oC average warming, respectively.

Winners and losers

With the head start that developed nations (Europe, USA, Canada, Australia and Japan) had for using fossil fuels since the industrial revolution began, the average per capita GDP of high-income countries in 2018 was US$ 44,787, ten-fold greater than that of low + middle-income countries (US$ 4,971) and twenty times that of South Asia (US$ 1,903).

There is a correlation between material development measured by per capita GDP, the Human Development Index (HDI) and per capita energy consumption and CO 2 emissions (see Table 2 in the Annex). North countries have historically used more energy (per capita energy use today is 4.6 toe) and consequently have higher cumulative CO 2 emissions. Developed countries with 16% of the global population today have consumed 69% of all fossil fuels expended since the industrial revolution and therefore are materially more advanced than developing countries. The latter constitute 84% of the world’s population today, but their per capita energy consumption is only 1.3 toe. The per capita cumulative emissions of North and South nations are 1,200 and 85 t/person[2], respectively (India’s per capita cumulative emissions are 35 t/person).

The world’s remaining available carbon space to be compliant with <1.5oC warming is <500 GtCO 2 . This space will shrink with the thawing of permafrost and further loss of the Amazon and boreal forests, leaving as little as 100 GtCO 2 of carbon space to remain compliant with a warming of 1.5oC. At the current emission rate of ~40 GtCO 2 /year, the remaining carbon space will be erased in the next few years.

Developing countries are in a Catch22 situation. If they burn more fossil fuels to “develop,” they will contribute significantly to warming that will contribute to crossing the 1.5-2oC redlines. If they control their emissions to avoid crossing the temperature rise redlines, they will remain permanently backward in comparison to the developed countries. There is no visible alternative energy source replacement for fossil fuels that currently contribute 79% of the world’s commercial energy. Even if the entire remaining carbon space is given to developing countries, they cannot achieve the material standards of developed countries.

The extreme vulnerability of South Asia

South Asia is one of two regions that already is, and will be most affected by climate change. It has a quarter of the world’s population but only 3.6% of its cumulative emissions. South Asia’s vulnerability is due to two factors–its geography and its low development. Its large land mass makes heat waves more severe, and its river deltas promote increased sea rise, decreased snow and glacier melt with warming will cause a decrease of water flow to snow-fed rivers and consequently cause water stress. South Asia’s current per capita GDP, which is less than a fifth of the global average, makes its population less resilient to meet climate change impacts. The primary risks to South Asia are outlined below:

Sea level rise: Seawater intrusion will render inland water sources close to the Bangladesh coastline unusable for drinking and agriculture. With sea level rise, the mangroves of the Sundarbans forest will erode, and with it, the protection it offers against frequent storm surges during cyclones will diminish. By 2100, about 20-25% of Bangladesh’s land mass will be lost to the sea, creating 50 million Bangladeshi climate refugees by 2050 and probably double that number by the end of the 21st Century. Bangladeshi refugees will be forced to migrate to North Bangladesh and into neighbouring countries. Having lost their livelihood, they will be subject to all manner of indignity and abuse—unemployment, disease, and child trafficking.

By 2100, Maldives, an archipelago of ~1,200 low-lying islands and atolls in the Indian Ocean with a population of 500,000, will become all but uninhabited as sea rise will drown almost the entire island state. The entire population of Maldives will become climate refugees.

Water stress: Global warming is expected to significantly impact snow and glacier melt in the Himalayas. Water stress will impact all South Asian countries, except Bhutan. As the glaciers melt, they will initially cause an increase in meltwater in snow-fed drivers, followed by a decline. Glacial melt will impact all major snow-fed South Asian rivers—Brahmaputra (India, Bangladesh), Ganga (India, Bangladesh), Indus (India, Pakistan), Amu Darya (Afghanistan) and their tributaries.

Snow and glacier melt contribute a significantly higher amount to the total discharge (see Table 3 in Annex) in the Indus (60%) and the Amu Darya (70%) in comparison to the Ganga and the Brahmaputra (9-21%). The Indus basin is largely in Pakistan and a part of the Amu Darya basin is in Afghanistan. The Indus is the only major river that flows through Pakistan. In a warming world, the discharge of the Indus, and the Amu Darya will decrease significantly, causing large parts of Pakistan and northeastern Afghanistan to become severely water-stressed and drought-stricken by 2040-50, and that will compromise the water and food security of about 60 million people living in these basins. Though Sri Lanka does not have any major rivers, it will be water-stressed in a few decades.

Glacial lake outburst floods: As glaciers melt, the volume of water in a glacial lake located at the mouth of many Himalayan glaciers will increase and exert greater pressure on the moraine dam that holds it. When the water pressure on the dam exceeds its material failure limit, it will give way and the glacial lake will pour out millions of tonnes of water, causing a Glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF), whose impact will be felt for up to 100-150 km downstream. Villages, fields and everything else that is in a GLOF’s path will be washed away. A recent study compiled an inventory of 62 GLOFs that have occurred in the Himalayas in the last 80 years (see Table 4 in the Annex). With climate change, the frequency of GLOF is expected to increase in the Himalayas.

Extreme weather events: South Asia saw extremely hot March-April months, with temperatures soaring 4-5oC above normal. South Asia also had a very wet monsoon this year that killed 3,700 persons in floods that occurred in Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. A third of Pakistan was flooded in July-August, affecting 33 million persons, killing over 1,500 people, putting half a million people in relief camps and causing a property loss of $40 billion.

India will be impacted by many types of climate change-related events—sea rise, GLOFs, extreme weather events (abnormally high temperatures or precipitation), floods, drought, cyclones, significant crop yield losses, erratic rainfall, heat stress, etc. A large number of extreme weather events have occurred in India in the last 15 years (see Table 5 in the Annex), indicating that more of them are likely to happen in future.

A study on heat stress and mortality done in Surat concludes that “There is an increase of 11% all-cause mortality when temperature crossed 40oC. There is a direct relationship between mortality and HI (high heat index). Mean daily mortality shows a significant association with daily maximum temperature and HI.” Another recent study established a correlation between high temperatures and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in rural areas by reviewing studies done in several continents—Asia, North and South America and Africa. The study concludes, “One of the consequences of climate-related extreme heat exposure is dehydration and volume loss, leading to acute mortality from exacerbations of pre-existing chronic disease, as well as from outright heat exhaustion and heat stroke.”

SAPACC’s demands

Considering the grave situation described above and the time for correction is very short, SAPACC calls upon the President of COP 27, the United Nations General Secretary, and all nations to declare a climate emergency immediately and consider implementing the following measures to move towards a sustainable, equitable and peaceful society:

Sustainability: Developed nations must pledge to become net carbon negative in consumption emissions by 2030-35 to create space for developing nations to decarbonise by 2040-50. Decarbonisation must focus primarily on: a) Mitigation focussed on the reduction of consumption levels in the Global North, and supply-side management, leaving >90% of the remaining fossil fuel reserves in the ground; b) Sequestration focussed on Nature Based Solutions that centre climate and social justice. In addition, decarbonization strategies must eschew failed, untested, hypothetical market-based solutions and techno-fixes. Through these means, gross global consumption should be reduced to sustainable levels, the measure for which should be a quantifiable justice-centric sustainability index.

Environmental justice: a) Responsibility for loss & damage: Nations/regions should take responsibility for climate change impacts attributable to them—displacement, property loss, etc—in proportion to their cumulative emissions (emissions from 1750-to date); Developed countries should deliver promised climate finance in time; b) Sharing benefits and risks equally: All people of the world should share equally the wealth created by GHG emissions as well as the risks caused by them. Humans have no property rights over fossil fuels as it is nature that made them.

Humans have no property rights over fossil fuels as it is nature that made them. Equity: The maximum/minimum ratio for income/energy consumption for all people in the world should be ≤5.

The maximum/minimum ratio for income/energy consumption for all people in the world should be ≤5. Environmental restitution: Degraded land, water, air, and to the extent possible, biodiversity should be restituted to their pre-industrial period quality.

Degraded land, water, air, and to the extent possible, biodiversity should be restituted to their pre-industrial period quality. Decentralization, democratic, transparent climate governance: As people’s involvement is essential for tackling the climate crisis, climate governance should be decentralized and democratized, governance information should be in the public domain, and people’s assemblies set up worldwide to allow people’s voices to be heard and reflected in climate decisions.

This week, in the city of Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, leaders from around the world will gather to negotiate over carbon emissions — for the 27th consecutive time. Although this year’s U.N. Climate Change Conference — known as COP27 — will be in a new setting, in many other ways the conference will probably feel like deja vu. For almost three decades, governments have met to discuss the problem of climate change and tried to work toward a solution that will keep global warming from topping 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). They have negotiated, signed treaties, reneged on those treaties and signed new ones.

And almost every year, carbon emissions have continued to climb.

In 1995, when the first United Nations climate conference was held in Berlin, the countries of the world released approximately 23 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from burning coal, oil and natural gas. This year, that number is expected to be about 34 billion tons. Roughly half of all CO2 emitted since 1751, just before the start of the Industrial Revolution, was released in just the past 30 years.

It’s hard to look at those numbers and see the international climate response as anything less than a failure. As global emissions climb, is the system working at all?

David Victor, a professor of public policy at the University of California at San Diego, says the answer depends. “If by ‘working,’ you mean that the global negotiations themselves are producing the change, the answer is no,” he said. But, he argues, that was never the right way to judge the effectiveness of international policymaking on climate.

Part of that is because the Paris agreement — the landmark accord reached in 2015 to try to limit global warming to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius, and to aim for 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) — has always been a strange sort of treaty. Before the agreement, most people thought the best way to combat climate change on the world stage was to get everyone to sign on to binding emissions reductions. But that never caught on: Many countries, including the United States, refused to agree to mandatory emissions reductions. For decades, global climate diplomacy was essentially stalled.

At the conference in Paris in 2015, countries tried a different approach. They agreed to voluntarily lower their emissions, by making regular pledges known tongue-twistingly as “nationally determined contributions.” There would be no universal mandates for everyone to cut emissions by a particular date — countries could choose their own adventure for how and when to stop spewing CO2 into the atmosphere. If leaders didn’t bring more-ambitious pledges, meanwhile, they would be “named and shamed” by others.

In the seven years since the summit in Paris, many pledges have indeed gotten more ambitious. More than 70 countries, including China, the United States and the European Union, have set targets to slash their emissions to zero by 2050. If all those pledges are followed through on — a humongous “if” — the world will warm approximately 2.1 degrees Celsius by 2100. (That’s if countries follow through on their long-term goals; if they only follow through on existing short-term goals for 2030, a recent U.N. report found the world would warm by 2.4 degrees Celsius.)

Both of those estimates are a far cry from 1.5 degrees Celsius — the “stretch” goal set out in the Paris agreement — but they’re also much better than previous projections, which predicted warming of 3 or even 4 degrees.

Victor says the benefit of the Paris framework is that it allows more flexibility; countries can be as ambitious as they want to be, while also experimenting and forming smaller agreements to tackle specific aspects of the problem. For example, world leaders can join together in a vow to decrease emissions of methane, a very strong greenhouse gas, in the short term, or collaborate on a promise to push forward electric vehicle adoption.

The downside, of course, is that none of the targets are binding. So beyond setting up the pledges, COP27 isn’t the place for countries to actually follow through on their promises. The actual emissions reductions will take place at home. “There isn’t a lot more that can be done on the international level with these conversations,” said Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University. “The limiting factor of what countries do right now is their domestic political systems.”

There is also another issue that has yet to be worked out. When almost 200 nations agreed to the Paris framework in 2015, they did so under the promise that rich, developed countries would send money to poorer, developing countries — both to help them build clean energy and to adapt to rising sea levels and climate-supercharged weather events. But so far, much of that money — including $100 billion every year that was promised by rich countries — has not materialized.

Countries such as Pakistan, which recently faced devastating floods that scientists say were exacerbated by climate change, have also begun to push developed countries to provide compensation for damage caused by warming temperatures. So far, however, rich countries have refused to play ball. That battle is poised to be one of the biggest issues at the upcoming meeting in Egypt.

For years, negotiations over this part of the agreement have been shunted to the side in favor of carbon-cutting pledges. But now developing countries are getting frustrated and impatient. “If this issue doesn’t get resolved constructively, it will eventually get in the way of making progress on other fronts,” Oppenheimer said.

That discussion will be top-of-mind for many negotiators in Egypt. Even if the ambitious pledges part of the Paris agreement is currently working, the process could unravel if cash doesn’t come through as promised. Developing countries “will always want to bring the spotlight back to this issue,” Oppenheimer said. “It’ll clog up the works — and then there won’t be international progress.”

ac599e86-053e-422a-85c0-610b2ba328e8,"Climate change is a global problem that requires cooperation between all nations. That’s why today more than 30 newspapers and media organisations in more than 20 countries have taken a common view about what needs to be done. Time is running out. Rather than getting out of fossil fuels and into clean energy, many wealthy nations are reinvesting in oil and gas, failing to cut emissions fast enough and haggling over the aid they are prepared to send to poor countries. All this while the planet hurtles towards the point of no return – where climate chaos becomes irreversible.

Since the Cop26 UN climate summit in Glasgow 12 months ago, countries have only promised to do one-fiftieth of what is needed to stay on track to keep temperatures within 1.5C of pre-industrial levels. No continent has avoided extreme weather disasters this year – from floods in Pakistan to heatwaves in Europe, and from forest fires in Australia to hurricanes in the US. Given that these came about from elevated temperatures of about 1.1C, the world can expect far worse to come.

As many nations seek to reduce their reliance on Russia, the world is experiencing a “gold rush” for new fossil fuel projects. These are cast as temporary supply measures, but they risk locking the planet into irreversible damage. All this underlines that humanity has to end its addiction to fossil fuels. If renewable energy was the norm there would be no climate emergency.

The world’s poorest people will bear the brunt of the destruction wreaked by drought, melting ice sheets and crop failures. To shield these groups from the loss of life and livelihoods will require money. Developing countries, says one influential report, need $2tn annually to cut their greenhouse gas emissions and cope with climate breakdown.

Rich countries account for just one in eight people in the world today but are responsible for half of greenhouse gases. These nations have a clear moral responsibility to help. Developing nations should be given enough cash to address the dangerous conditions they did little to create – especially as a global recession looms.

Rich nations should deliver on the promise of previously committed funds – such as the $100bn a year from 2020 – to signal their seriousness. As a bare minimum, a windfall tax on the combined profits of the largest oil and gas companies – estimated at almost $100bn in the first three months of the year – needs to be enacted. The United Nations was right to call for the cash to be used to support the most vulnerable. But such a levy would only be the start. Poor nations also carry debts that make it impossible to recover after climate-related disasters or protect themselves from future ones. Creditors should be generous in writing off loans for those on the frontline of the climate emergency.

These measures need not wait for coordinated international action. Countries could implement them on regional or national levels. A nation’s cumulative emissions must be the basis of its responsibility to act. While private finance can help, the onus is on big historical emitters to stump up the money.

Solving the crisis is the moonshot of our times. Getting to the moon succeeded within a decade because huge resources were devoted to it. A similar commitment is needed now. But an economic crisis has reduced rich countries’ appetite for spending and the planet risks being trapped in fossil-fuel dependence by a rearguard action of big business. Yet during the pandemic, central banks across the world lubricated states’ expenditure by buying up their own governments’ bonds. The trillions of dollars needed to deal with the ecological emergency demand such radical thinking returns.

This is no time for apathy or complacency; the urgency of the moment is upon us. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change must be about the power of argument not the argument of power. Key to maintaining the consensus in Egypt is not to let disputes over trade and war in Ukraine block global climate diplomacy. The UN process may not be perfect. But it has provided nations with a target to save the planet, which must be pursued at Cop27 to stave off an existential risk to humanity."

Something significant is happening in the desert in Egypt as countries meet at COP27, the United Nations summit on climate change.

Despite frustrating sclerosis in the negotiating halls, the pathway forward for ramping up climate finance to help low-income countries adapt to climate change and transition to clean energy is becoming clearer.

I spent a large part of my career working on international finance at the World Bank and the United Nations and now advise public development and private funds and teach climate diplomacy focusing on finance. Climate finance has been one of the thorniest issues in global climate negotiations for decades, but I’m seeing four promising signs of progress at COP27.

Getting to net zero – without greenwashing

First, the goal – getting the world to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 to stop global warming – is clearer.

The last climate conference, COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, nearly fell apart over frustration that international finance wasn’t flowing to developing countries and that corporations and financial institutions were greenwashing – making claims they couldn’t back up. One year on, something is stirring.

In 2021, the financial sector arrived at COP26 in full force for the first time. Private banks, insurers and institutional investors representing US$130 trillion said they would align their investments with the goal of keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius – a pledge to net zero. That would increase funding for green growth and clean energy transitions, and reduce investments in fossil fuels. It was an apparent breakthrough. But many observers cried foul and accused the financial institutions of greenwashing.

In the year since then, a U.N. commission has put a red line around greenwashing, delineating what a company or institution must do to make a credible claim about its net-zero goals. Its checklist isn’t mandatory, but it sets a high bar based on science and will help hold companies and investors to account.

Reforming international financial institutions

Second, how international financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund and World Bank are working is getting much-needed attention.

Over the past 12 months, frustration has grown with the international financial system, especially with the World Bank Group’s leadership. Low-income countries have long complained about having to borrow to finance resilience to climate impacts they didn’t cause, and they have called for development banks to take more risk and leverage more private investment for much-needed projects, including expanding renewable energy.

That frustration has culminated in pressure for World Bank President David Malpass to step down. Malpass, nominated by the Trump administration in 2019, has clung on for now, but he is under pressure from the U.S., Europe and others to bring forward a new road map for the World Bank’s response to climate change this year.

Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley, a leading voice for reform, and others have called for $1 trillion already in the international financial system to be redirected to climate resilience projects to help vulnerable countries protect themselves from future climate disasters.

At COP27, French President Emmanuel Macron supported Mottley’s call for a shake-up in how international finance works, and together they have agreed to set up a group to suggest changes at the next meeting of the IMF and World Bank governors in spring 2023.

Meanwhile, regional development banks have been reinventing themselves to better address their countries’ needs. The Inter-American Development Bank, focused on Latin America and the Caribbean, is considering shifting its business model to take more risk and crowd in more private sector investment. The Asian Development Bank has launched an entirely new operating model designed to achieve greater climate results and leverage private financing more effectively.

Getting private finance flowing

Third, more public-private partnerships are being developed to speed decarbonization and power the clean energy transition.

The first of these “Just Energy Transition Partnerships,” announced in 2021, was designed to support South Africa’s transition away from coal power. It relies on a mix of grants, loans and investments, as well as risk sharing to help bring in more private sector finance. Indonesia announced a similar partnership at the G-20 summit in November worth $20 billion. Vietnam is working on another, and Egypt announced a major new partnership at COP27.

However, the public funding has been hard to lock in. Developed countries’ coffers are dwindling, with governments including the U.S. unable or unwilling to maintain commitments. Now, pressure from the war in Ukraine and economic crises is adding to their problems.

The lack of public funds was the impetus behind U.S. Special Climate Envoy John Kerry’s proposal to use a new form of carbon offsets to pay for green energy investments in countries transitioning from coal. The idea, loosely sketched out, is that countries dependent on coal could sell carbon credits to companies, with the revenue going to fund clean energy projects. The country would speed its exit from coal and lower its emissions, and the private company could then claim that reduction in its own accounting toward net zero emissions.

Globally, voluntary carbon markets for these offsets have grown from $300 million to $2 billion since 2019, but they are still relatively small and fragile and need more robust rules.

Kerry’s proposal drew criticism, pending the fine print, for fear of swamping the market with industrial credits, collapsing prices and potentially allowing companies in the developed world to greenwash their own claims by retiring coal in the developing world.

New rules to strengthen carbon markets

Fourth, new rules are emerging to strengthen those voluntary carbon markets.

A new set of “high-integrity carbon credit principles” is expected in 2023. A code of conduct for how corporations can use voluntary carbon markets to meet their net zero claims has already been issued, and standards for ensuring that a company’s plans meet the Paris Agreement’s goals are evolving.

Incredibly, all this progress is outside the Paris Agreement, which simply calls for governments to make “finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development.”

Negotiators seem reluctant to mention this widespread reform movement in the formal text being negotiated at COP27, but walking through the halls here, they cannot ignore it. It’s been too slow in coming, but change in the financial system is on the way.

After all, before last year’s Glasgow talks, experts warned the summit was the world’s last chance to limit global warming to 1.5℃ this century. And yet, a UN report last week found even if all nations meet their climate goals this decade, the planet would still heat by a catastrophic 2.5℃.

There were hopes the global pandemic might have shifted the world’s economies from their fossil fuel dependence as lockdowns reduced energy consumption, and progressive politicians proposed alternative policy agendas.

But after borders reopened, our fossil fuel addiction returned with a vengeance. In fact, the International Energy Agency projects net income for oil and gas producers will double in 2022 to an alarming US$4 trillion.

As social scientists, this is both horrifying and fascinating to observe. How is it that a technologically advanced society could choose to destroy itself by failing to act to avert a climate catastrophe?

We’ve had decades to act

Like watching a slow-motion train crash, the world’s leading climate scientists have for decades warned of the dangers of ever-increasing greenhouse gas emissions.

Political and corporate leaders knew of the threat more than a decade before it was key public knowledge. Back in 1977, United States President Jimmy Carter was briefed on the possibility of catastrophic climate change. That same year, internal memos at one of the world’s largest oil companies made it clear that continued burning of fossil fuels would dramatically heat the planet.

So why, in the 45 years since, has there been so little action in response? Why do we condemn today’s children and future generations to live on a dangerous and hostile planet?

We’ve sought to answer this question in our research into business and climate change over the years, including our latest book.

The answer, we argue, rests on a prevailing assumption organised by corporate and political elites: that endless economic growth fuelled by fossil energy is so fundamental and commonsensical it cannot be questioned.

We term this all-consuming ideology the “fossil fuel hegemony”. It asserts that corporate capitalism based on fossil energy is a natural state of being, one that’s beyond challenge.

How fossil fuel hegemony works

The concept of “hegemony” was developed by the Italian intellectual Antonio Gramsci. In the 1920s, Gramsci sought to explain how dominant classes maintained their power beyond the use of force and coercion.

He argued hegemony involved a continuous process of winning the consent of key actors in society such as industrialists, the media, and religious and educational institutions, to form a ruling bloc. Civil society would thus accept the prevailing order, dampening any threat of revolution.

Gramsci’s ideas help us understand the lack of action in response to the climate crisis. In particular, it helps explain the business sector’s inordinate influence on climate policy across the world.

For instance, a range of recent studies have explored the “fossil fuel hegemony” in countries such as Australia, Canada and the US. These studies argue such hegemony comprises a coalition of corporate and political actors with interests aligned around carbon-dependent economic growth. This leads to limited progress on legislation to reduce carbon emissions.

The hegemony has also extended to corporate-political activity seeding doubt about climate science, lobbying against emissions reduction and renewable energy, and the capture of political parties by interests aligned with fossil fuels.

This helps explain why environmentalists advocating to keep fossil fuels in the ground are attacked by conservative politicians and right-wing media.

They are presented not only as a threat to “our way of life”, but as deluded and dangerous radicals, or even terrorists.

There is another way

Of course, there are alternatives to the fossil fuel hegemony. It involves immediate and dramatic decarbonisation of the global economy, as COP27 in Egypt aspires to achieve.

But it also requires alternative economic models of “degrowth”. Degrowth involves a planned and equitable contraction of rich economies, until it operates steadily and within the capacity of the planet’s resources.

This includes carbon trading systems with a rapidly lowering cap, fossil fuel extraction limits, worker autonomy and shorter working hours, and job guarantees with living wages.

These types of policies rest on tax reforms to limit resource use and reduce carbon emissions, while promoting work sharing and limiting production and consumption.

This also requires far more democratic politics than the current hegemony allows – one that challenges the illusion that economic growth can continue even as Earth’s life-support systems begin to fail.

But the true test of the fossil fuel hegemony will be how long this image can persist as the weather becomes more extreme and climate activism grows.

Because as more people acknowledge the reality of the climate crisis, those seeking to maintain the fossil fuel hegemony will need to work harder to maintain their grip on climate politics."
225a4eec-99d0-406d-97af-662ae9d86b0d,"Climate change is a global problem that requires cooperation between all nations. That’s why today more than 30 newspapers and media organizations in more than 20 countries have taken a common view about what needs to be done. Time is running out. Rather than getting out of fossil fuels and into clean energy, many wealthy nations are reinvesting in oil and gas, failing to cut emissions fast enough and haggling over the aid they are prepared to send to poor countries. All this while the planet hurtles towards the point of no return – where climate chaos becomes irreversible.

Since the Cop26 UN climate summit in Glasgow 12 months ago, countries have only promised to do one fiftieth of what is needed to stay on track to keep temperatures within 1.5°C of pre-industrial levels. No continent has avoided extreme weather disasters this year — from floods in Pakistan to heatwaves in Europe, and from forest fires in Australia to hurricanes in the US. Given that these came about from elevated temperatures of about 1.1C, the world can expect far worse to come.

As many nations seek to reduce their reliance on Russia, the world is experiencing a “gold rush” for new fossil fuel projects. These are cast as temporary supply measures, but they risk locking the planet into irreversible damage. All this underlines that humanity has to end its addiction to fossil fuels. If renewable energy was the norm there would be no climate emergency.

The world’s poorest people will bear the brunt of the destruction wrought by drought, melting ice sheets and crop failures. To shield these groups from the loss of life and livelihoods will require money. Developing countries, says one influential report, need $2 trillion annually to cut their greenhouse gas emissions and cope with climate breakdown.

Another climate-related tenet of the Great Reset conspiracy theory is the idea that those in power want to control food production and police what people eat.

In reference to the Dutch farmers' protests, The Post Millennial tweeted out a quote from Posobiec on July 7, which said, “The government of the Netherlands perhaps should be listening to their farmers ... instead of listening to the WEF and pushing the Great Reset green agenda upon them.”

In a discussion on general problems facing the U.S. on the September 3 edition of Newsmax’s Wendy Bell Common Sense, right-wing radio host Jeff Kuhner stated, “It's the Great Reset. … Many of these left wing global – they want food shortages. They want energy rationing. They want to break the back of the middle and working class of this country.”

Great Reset conspiracy theorists also imply that people will be forced to eat insects. In July, pseudo-journalist and Holocaust denier Peter Sweden got over 12,000 likes on a tweet saying, “In Belgium there are now talks about an ‘environment tax’ on meat. They want you to eat bugs and be happy. Are you enjoying The Great Reset?”

Dog whistling about the Great Reset

Oftentimes, the term Great Reset won’t be directly referenced, but certain keywords and allusions are used as dog whistles. In September, Peter Sweden and Morano baselessly claimed people will be forced to eat bugs.

Another example comes from right-wing writer Joel Kotkin in Newsweek, who, on September 19, suggested that coronavirus lockdowns are a test run for coming climate lockdowns, and both are “top-down edicts over how people live.”

Fox News star Tucker Carlson also alluded to the Great Reset conspiracy theory on the September 9 edition of Fox News’ The Ingraham Angle. Discussing the energy crisis, Carlson suggested that transitioning away from fossil fuels is about control. He claimed, “Energy is civilization. … People don’t understand how threatening this is and how close we are to being under the complete and total control of people who wish us ill.”

Additionally, if a speaker references “globalists,” Klaus Schwab, Davos, or the World Economic Forum within a climate denial context, that’s generally a sign they are referring to the Great Reset. For example, on the September 9 edition of Newsmax’s Real America, Rep. Marjorie Taylor-Greene (R-GA) suggested that global elites are pushing climate policies to make money at the expense of the poor. She said, “They want the climate crisis to continue because they make money off of it. … They're so disconnected. And they truly are globalists and they're more interested in the World Economic Forum and what Klaus Schwab has to offer.”

Key drivers of the Great Reset conspiracy theory are popular figures within the right-wing media ecosystem

One such narrative-shaper is Morano, a longtime climate denier and frequent Fox News guest who recently wrote a book titled “The Great Reset: Global Elites and the Permanent Lockdown.” In addition to various Newsmax appearances, Morano appeared on two separate OAN shows on September 16 to discuss the Great Reset. In July, his book was promoted on Tucker Carlson Tonight. On October 8, he appeared on Fox News’ Unfiltered with Dan Bongino and said the Great Reset is about “collapsing our energy, food, transportation, and our free speech rights.” He’s also been doing right-wing radio interviews promoting his Great Reset conspiracy theory book.

Hosts on Newsmax are also promoting the Great Reset conspiracy theory. Bolling has devoted several segments to climate denial and the Great Reset in recent months. On the October 13 edition of his program, Bolling lied about President “Joebama” waging a “war on our own oil independence,” and that he is making people “suffer for the Great Reset. Control us for the Great Reset.” He said this all alongside a chyron that stated, “You shall eat no meat.”

Newsmax anchor Rob Schmitt also pushed this idea on the September 29 edition of his show Rob Schmitt Tonight, stating, “In 50 years we will still be burning fossil fuels on this planet. … No person is actually going to gut their quality of life to help John Kerry implement a Great Reset that will do nothing to save the climate and insidious plan that really just rapidly socializes our country and the world, which is what they really want.” Newsmax anchor Chris Salcedo also mentioned the Great Reset on his show on September 15.

Popular alt-right media personalities are also driving much of the Great Reset chatter. One example is Peter Sweden, whose regular tweets about climate denial and the Great Reset receive significant engagement. One tweet, which racked up tens of thousands of likes, stated, “The Great Reset is another word for Global Communism.” Two other tweets with significant engagement also exhibit climate denial and link the Great Reset to “global communism.”

Jack Posobiec is another right-wing figure pushing Great Reset talking points. In September, Turning Point USA (TPUSA) hosted an event in Phoenix called “Defeating the Great Reset.” Notable speakers included Posobiec, Charlie Kirk, and Steve Bannon. The description of the event lied about the WEF’s plan, saying they want people to “own nothing and be happy” (a Reuters fact check from early 2021 disputed this claim). Conference speaker James Lindsey invoked this phrase and insinuated that powerful elites will come after our modes of transportation. Additionally, Charlie Kirk interviewed guest attendee Alex Jones about banning meat, with Jones saying that meat is a “symbol of freedom” and that “globalists” want to ban it.

What’s worse, the September 22 of Kirk’s podcast was entirely devoted to climate denial, using the title “Exposing the Great Climate Change Hoax.” The Great Reset was mentioned multiple times in this episode. He also alluded to climate lockdowns, stating, “How do you stop a virus? You lock down everything. How do you stop climate change? You lock down everything.” He also claimed that dictators use crises “to get their tyranny, their power, their control implemented.” He then called climate change “the next crisis and the perfect one.” He also suggested that the transition to clean energy is all about a transition to more global government and less freedom. Finally, Kirk used violent rhetoric to describe climate activists, noting that the “​​enviro-fascist movement” is “the greatest threat to civilization.”

Tenets of the Great Reset conspiracy theory have also popped up on Fox News, which is the most-watched cable news network in the United States. In addition to the examples above, the September 7 edition of Tucker Carlson Tonight featured a segment on the growing threat of climate lockdowns. Ingraham also mentioned lockdowns on the October 30 edition of The Ingraham Angle, where she insinuated that the climate crisis, much like the pandemic, is made up, and that it will be an excuse for elites to “extend emergency powers” over the population.

This conspiracy theory will only get worse from here – news outlets should pay attention

Given the growing proliferation of the Great Reset conspiracy theory in right-wing media, it’s worth noting that there are legitimate critiques of the WEF’s vague proposal outside of unhinged conspiracy theories. The BBC deep dive referenced earlier found that the lack of clarity around Schwab’s screed provided fertile breeding ground for conspiracy theories to grow. Writing in The Intercept in late 2020, climate writer Naomi Klein argued that people have a right to be skeptical of wealthy and powerful figures introducing bold new ideas, stating that the Great Reset “is an attempt to create a plausible impression that the huge winners in this system are on the verge of voluntarily setting greed aside to get serious about solving the raging crises that are radically destabilizing our world.” Finally, writer Ivan Wecke argues the real issue with the Great Reset idea is that it gives corporations, and not democratic institutions, more control over our lives.

The lack of clarity around the original Great Reset idea and the real problems associated with it make the right-wing conspiracy theories related to it all the more worrying. Given the threats posed by climate change, we do need to envision a way to create a more sustainable future. Global dialogue on climate action is necessary to do this, and it’s why conferences like the upcoming COP27 are crucial: We need forums to discuss ways to phase out our deadly addiction to fossil fuels and introduce cleaner sources of energy that will allow those at the bottom to live more just and equitable lives.

The right’s Great Reset conspiracy theory flips all of this on its head: By calling climate change a hoax to advance a tyrannical agenda, Great Reset conspiracy adherents are advocating for a future with more fossil fuels which will lead to more devastating climate impacts that will disproportionately affect those at the bottom.

The Cambridge Extinction Rebellion Twitter account did an excellent job of explaining why this conspiracy theory should be taken seriously, noting that adherents “will frame fossil fuels around notions of freedom, claiming pro climate and anti fossil fuel policies harm freedom. They will heavily capitalize on the energy crisis this winter to advance this narrative. It is likely to be persuasive to many.” Given the rapid spread of conspiracy theories like QAnon and the belief that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Trump, people need to understand the danger behind climate denial and the right-wing Great Reset conspiracy theory. They can start by keeping an eye on it around COP27 discussions."

Reducing emissions isn’t enough to solve the climate crisis. As the world meets in Egypt at COP27 to discuss navigating our climate emergency, hopes are now turning to emerging “negative emissions technologies” that can remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and lock them away.

We’re going to need NETs to meet any net-zero goal and to ideally limit global warming to 1.5 C above preindustrial levels by 2050. Follow such approaches and practices in the news, and you will see grand proposals: planting forests to photosynthetically drawdown carbon dioxide; machines that suck CO2 from the air with chemical sponges; changing ocean chemistry to draw down CO2 from the air. Some ideas might come across as “natural,” others more “engineered.”

NETs are also creating a buzz with venture capitalists and large corporations. For some, that’s an unsettling starting point to an incredibly important public conversation about our shared future. Indeed, we must ensure these planet-saving yet potentially disruptive technologies are deployed wisely and in the public interest.

Despite the urgency, an organized sector does not yet exist to develop NETs. We lack vision for what quantities we need or what qualities they require – or even who is responsible for convening that conversation.

What we do know: NETs cannot come at the expense of aggressively reducing current sources of “positive” emissions. These technologies must compliment a rapidly decarbonizing world. And, if we’re going to use them as part of the climate solution, we need a concrete strategy for their use moving forward.

My recent report, Survive and Thrive: Why BC needs a CO2 removal strategy now, urges our public policy makers in British Columbia and throughout Canada to take a leadership role in the essential and urgent task of unlocking the potential of NETs.

The B.C. government supports the development of NETs, as outlined in the CleanBC Roadmap to 2030 report, and Ottawa has voiced approval as well. We look to governments to provide the leadership for a strategy to apply these solutions with eyes wide open and the public interest always at the forefront.

Decision makers need to see past the marketing and dig into the particulars to fully understand how the use of a certain NET in a certain place will unfold. Benefits and impacts need to be carefully weighed, informed by diverse local, regional and global perspectives, including scientists and Indigenous communities, along with industry and other voices.

We need to be visionary and values-based, fostering deep collaboration, yet be decisively quick in developing this strategy. We need to form a “catalytic community” that has the agility and ingenuity of the private sector with the long-term capacity of the public sector.

We also need to ask the right questions: Where is the carbon originating? How is it captured? Where is it going? How permanent is that destination? What are the long-term implications? Who will be affected and why?

NETs will have impacts and they won’t necessarily be gentle ones – they will weigh on the relationships amongst the human, non-human, lands and waters – which means difficult decisions lie ahead.

We have an opportunity to develop a made-in-Canada strategy for NETs and, if we do, our country will demonstrate its global leadership in this emerging and essential sector.

But time is of the essence: We cannot afford to repeat the pattern of indecisiveness that has gotten us to this point in the climate crisis. The clamour of politics and the marketplace must not distract us, and we must step forward knowing all of life on Earth is imperilled.

A strategic and ethical commitment to NETs is an essential part of sustainable, long-lasting climate action."

Even at the best of times, navigating the Hunger Games scenario that is the parking lot of the Toronto mall I have been shopping at since childhood can be a soul-destroying experience. But as I sat there in an endless snake of cars over the weekend, I felt a heap of guilt along with the usual annoyance. Fresh in my mind were images I’d seen of fast-fashion castoffs creating literal hills of waste in countries such as Ghana.

Then, on Monday, I felt even worse about our societal addiction to consumption, as UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned the COP27 summit in Egypt that humanity is on ”a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator.”

We need to ask ourselves: who is doing the bulk of that driving? And through which countries is that highway careering through, primarily?

We are all connected, and arguably never more so than when it comes to the climate emergency. We can feel a (false) sense of safety and security in our North American bubble, but halfway across the world, vulnerable nations are enduring the consequences of our overconsumption, right now.

“Africa should not pay for crimes they have not committed,” Central African Republic President Faustin-Archange Touadéra told COP27. “Like other islands, our contribution in the destruction of the planet is minimal,” added Seychelles President Wavel Ramkalawan, “yet we suffer the most.” Mr. Ramkalawan also called for wealthier countries to help repair “the damage you caused to us.”

The idea of industrialized economies compensating developing countries for damage related to climate change has long been discussed. But it now seems to be gaining traction at COP27, with promises for climate-adaptation funding through a loss-and-damage insurance program called the Global Shield starting to trickle in.

Meanwhile, those images from Ghana sent me down a rabbit hole, where I read that an estimated 60 per cent of one particular landfill cliff in the capital, Accra, is made up of unwanted clothing – stuff that many of us, with good intentions, have placed in charity bins or brought back to the store to recycle.

I am part of the problem, I know – I’m writing this while clad in H&M sweats and a (very old) Target T-shirt. I am trying to adjust my habits. But individual action can feel so meaningless.

Last summer, I noticed that one of our shower caddies was looking pretty gross – full of soap scum and possibly rust. Feeling virtuous, I decided I would give it a good wash rather than chuck it into the landfill and buy a new one. I spent hours soaking it, scrubbing it, willing it back to cleanliness. And as I wrapped it back around the shower head, gleaming with new life, I felt proud: I had saved this shower caddy from further polluting the Earth.

Two days later, we travelled to the U.S. (yes, we flew – I know, much worse than the aborted bathroom accessory purchase), to a part of the country where food is apparently not composted. As I watched people in public places shovel giant plates of partly eaten meals into overflowing trash cans, headed for the landfill, I thought about my shower caddy efforts and felt pretty deflated.

I can adjust my habits all I want – I can buy more sustainable brands (which I’m trying to do), compost, reuse and recycle, and refrain from purchasing new bathroom accessories on a whim – but how much can that really accomplish? Unfortunately, it’s a lot less than government policies to protect us from climate change, and aid for developing countries that are being harmed by our habits. Canada has committed billions to this fight – and must continue its support.

In his book tour stop in Toronto last weekend, rock star and political activist Bono thanked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for the foreign aid Canada has provided to fight HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. His message was completely transferable to the climate emergency.

That funding means “freedom from despair for so many people who you’re not going to meet and won’t be able to thank you,” Bono said. “But I can thank you on their behalf. Thank you, Canada.” The audience went wild.

Sure, this was a friendly crowd – definitely pro-Bono, if you’ll excuse the expression. But this desire to help is one we should all share. There but for the grace of God, go all of us. I know that contributing through my taxes – for international climate aid and climate-friendly policies at home – will do a lot more than anything I can do as an individual.

I also know the world depends on it."
fcf5f818-2b49-4805-bf87-f63d5b0075d0,"Political dithering and global economic pressures have made it hard for many countries to reach their goals. Gas prices remain high all over the world due to the war in Ukraine as well as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) slashing oil production . With desperate times come desperate measures: President Biden softened his stance on oil and gas leases in light of the surging energy costs. Europe, facing a winter of high energy costs, is looking for immediate drilling solutions even while it tries to increase renewables.

Under current emissions-reduction efforts, the world is en route to 2.6 degrees of warming by the end of the century, according to the U.N. Emissions Gap Report . If every country were to meet its U.N. pledge, that could be reduced to a 1.8-degree increase. But governments are not prioritizing climate action. Of the 193 countries that signed on to the Paris agreement, only 24 brought actual plans to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to COP27 , the annual U.N. climate summit. This year's carbon emissions are set to hit a record high, with no sign of dropping, reports The New York Times . The U.S.'s emissions increased by 1.5 percent and global emissions are 1 percent higher than in 2021. ""In terms of a trajectory and also in terms of policies, we are just not on track for 1.5 or even 2 degrees,"" Julia Steinberger, economist and professor from Switzerland's University of Lausanne, told CNBC .

Not unless the world starts making way more of an effort to cut emissions. To meet the 1.5-degree goal, emissions would need to peak by 2025 at the absolute latest, which seems highly unlikely. The temperature increase is already at 1.2 degrees Celsius. The U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a report in April warning it is "" almost inevitable "" that the world temperature will surpass 1.5 degrees Celsius even in the next few years.

The world has approximately nine years to significantly reduce its level of greenhouse gas emissions, or it will blow through the ""carbon budget"" allotted to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius. That's according to a recent assessment from the 2022 Global Carbon Budget . The 1.5 degrees target was enshrined in the 2015 U.N. Paris Climate Agreement , where 193 countries agreed to do their part to reduce emissions enough to avoid irreparable climate damage. But meeting that goal is becoming less and less likely, forcing global leaders to grapple with some hard truths. Here's everything you need to know:

But there's also a problem of accountability. Some argue the Paris agreement failed to hold countries to their emission-reduction commitments. The Economist writes that the agreement ""adopted a Herculean goal without any plausible plan for reaching it"" and that global leaders ""need to be more pragmatic, and face up to some hard truths.""

What kinds of hard truths?

Going over 1.5 degrees Celsius ""does not doom the planet,"" but the consequences will be dire indeed. Coral reefs will die out due to warming water temperatures; storms worldwide will strengthen; cities will flood due to rising sea levels, NPR explains. Coastal populations are at risk of losing their homes and habitats. Other nations will be more prone to droughts and water shortages, particularly in the Mediterranean region. NASA posits that close to 61 million more people would be exposed to drought conditions with 2 degrees of warming compared to 1.5 degrees. Higher temperatures would also cause many species to die off, and others to move northward towards cooler temperatures, which could lead to increased disease and potentially more pandemics.

For the most part, the highest polluting countries — the U.S. among them — are less likely to face the immediate ecological consequences of climate change, while smaller and poorer countries will bear the brunt. This has been the main theme at COP27: The African continent is already feeling the extreme effects of a warming world, and has demanded developed countries pay reparations for climate-related ""loss and damage.""

Should we be planning for an overshoot?

""Time for some realism,"" writes The Economist. Understanding that the 1.5-degrees goal is almost certainly out of reach may be painful, but will also help nations get pragmatic and adjust their plans. For example, global investment in renewable energy should be tripled, and more attention should be put on climate adaptation, especially in developing countries. Richer nations should be actively working to invest in minimizing the damage.

Admitting that dangerous warming is inevitable opens the door for policymakers to ""consider more radical ways to cool it,"" The Economist adds. Technologies like geoengineering and direct carbon capturing may be able to reverse some emissions and bring down temperatures over time but will require huge investment to bring to scale.

Is there any good news?

There are some glimmers of hope. Experts believe there does seem to be some ""leveling off"" of human emissions, especially since emissions from land-use changes like deforestation are 10 times less than fossil fuel emissions this year, CBS News reports. Also, the International Energy Agency forecast that Russia's war on Ukraine may actually speed up the transition to renewable energy because many nations are striving for energy independence.

Admitting defeat on 1.5-degrees allows world leaders an opportunity to refocus their efforts with new, achievable goals in mind, The Economist adds. They should be ""chastened by failure, not lulled by false hope."" And just because the world may have missed the first target does not delegitimize the overall goal of limiting warming as much as possible. Experts have even posited that temperatures can be brought down by the end of the century. ""We have to reduce ... greenhouse gas emissions as quickly as possible,"" says Pierre Friedlingstein, the lead author of the Global Carbon Budget. ""There's no time to wait."""

Self Destruct Button

We live in a technologically advanced global society and we've known about climate change for decades. So why, as a group of professors posit in a damning essay for The Conversation, are we ""choosing to destroy"" our planet — and with it, ourselves?

The essay was written as the world prepares for the upcoming COP27 conference, the latest of the UN's annual climate change summits. The academics, who hail from the University of Newcastle and the University of Sydney, aren't exactly optimistic that world leaders will actually get anything done this time around.

""Like watching a slow-motion train crash, the world's leading climate scientists have for decades warned of the dangers of ever-increasing greenhouse gas emissions,"" they write, referencing the fact that the US government and Exxon have each been aware of the potential for manmade climate catastrophe since the 1970s. ""Why do we condemn today's children and future generations to live on a dangerous and hostile planet?""

Fossil Fuel Hegemony

Their answer is alarming.

""Fossil fuel hegemony,"" the experts write, referring to what they consider to be a ""prevailing assumption organized by corporate and political elites"" that ""endless economic growth fueled by fossil energy is so fundamental and commonsensical it cannot be questioned.""

In other words, fossil fuel reliance is so widely accepted that it's become a both lived and ideological way of global life. Fossil fuels, under this hegemony, aren't just tools. They're a ""natural state of being,"" and to question their dominance is to question the fabric of society.

Indeed, this hegemony has proven to be a powerful political tool. Just look at how former president Donald Trump was able to galvanize the working class with his promise to reinvigorate the coal industry. The facts went out the door, and coal became a symbol for a way of life that once was — and by Trump's logic, a world that was taken away. (Trump was unable to ""bring back"" the coal industry, because coal is a dwindling, nonrenewable, and increasingly non-viable resource.)

Looking Ahead

The experts did offer some tangible solutions to this deeply complicated — and dire — global issue. Ultimately, though, they say the answer has to be rooted in degrowth, or a ""planned and equitable contraction of rich economies"" until sustainability can be reasonably achieved.

But that, as we've held witness to for decades now, has been out of reach since 1977.

More on climate change: Greta Thunberg Says Un Climate Conference Is a Scam and She's Not Attending

The post Professors Warn of “Horrifying” Self-Destruction of Human Civilization appeared first on Futurism."
95a8494a-4684-4189-addc-b7e3ee71be50,"The U.N.’s yearly climate summit COP27 kicked off this week in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt with a shockingly bleak message from Secretary General António Guterres: “We are in the fight of our lives, and we are losing. Greenhouse gas emissions keep growing, global temperatures keep rising, and our planet is fast approaching tipping points that will make climate chaos irreversible.”

To underscore his dire point, he added, “We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot still on the accelerator.”

If that weren’t bleak enough, in the lead up to COP27, the U.N. also released a report that plainly stated that there is now “no credible pathway” to achieve the lofty goal of keeping global temperature rise below 1.5 degrees Celsius (though the 2 degrees C goal is still within reach). There would need to be a radical transformation of society in order for this to happen, the report said.

So, we’re all on the Death Star right now. We all know about the vulnerability with the exhaust port but nobody seems to want to fix it—and the Rebels are on their way.

If you think that this represents a stark shift in climate messaging—from one of optimism and hope to one of unavoidable death and destruction—you’re not alone. The trend of climate doomerism has been on the rise in recent years, typified by a bleak outlook and general hopelessness when it comes to climate change news. Instead of believing that we can do something to prevent climate disaster, doomers believe that there’s no hope—especially since world leaders have shown time and again they’d rather kowtow to the fossil fuel industry.

There are even whole ecosystems of the internet dedicated to doomerism from Twitter communities, to podcasts, and even to the good old-fashioned blogosphere. Geoffrey McFarlen happens to be involved in all three branches. The self-described climate activist is also the founder of the Doomer’s Cafe blog and podcast of the same name. Both are meant to voice “unpleasant truths into the realm of public discourse” when it comes to climate change, he said.

To him, there are essentially two kinds of conversations surrounding climate change. First, there’s the established one where conservatives on the right deny or downplay the existence of the climate crisis and refuse to do anything; and liberals on the left say that there’s plenty of cause for concern, but believe it can be easily fixed through initiatives like transitioning away from fossil fuels to renewable energy.

The other conversation is more grim: “A very small but growing community that realizes that policy emerging from either mainstream view will invariably lead to societal collapse and/ or extinction of the human race,” McFarlen told The Daily Beast. “These are the climate alarmists, pejoratively referred to as doomists or doomers.”

“ There is no doomerism, simply realism. ” — Bill McGuire, University College London

It’s easy to see why doomerism has been so pervasive when it comes to discourse surrounding climate change. Scientists have been harping on the exact same issues for decades only to see their warnings decried as a cynical political ploy in order to scare up votes for Democrats. A misinformation industrial complex of climate denialism has emerged dedicated to maligning and discrediting facts and data provided by scientists.

Now, in 2022, a new generation of people are growing up seeing that—no matter how hard they try and how much data they provide to show that climate change is here and wreaking havoc—the powers that be simply do not care. And any efforts from these leaders to show that they might care comes up woefully short.

Take COP27 for example. Not only do many climate activists like Greta Thunberg see the conference as cynical, virtue signaling greenwashing event led by wealthy nations, but the event is also rife with hypocrisy. For example, the summit drew a lot of criticism due to the fact that it’s sponsored by Coca-Cola—the world’s leading plastic polluter.

In light of this, it makes sense that more and more people are going full on doomer. But climate scientists, thick in the muck of the data that tells us things are getting worse and worse, have historically also been some of the more optimistic voices emphasizing that it’s not too late for us to act. What does it mean when experts start saying the quiet part out loud: We might be completely fucked when it comes to climate change?

They’re not likely to admit it—at least not publicly. “No scientist I know wishes to be labeled a doomer,” McFarlan said. Instead, most will hedge by pointing out that most of the worst issues facing Earth can be avoided by transitioning to renewables. But McFarlan claims they’re quietly feeling it too.

In fact, the doomer label might really just be a matter of perspective, even when it comes to to problems that are putting us on that proverbial highway to climate hell. “There is no doomerism, simply realism,” said Bill McGuire, a climate scientist at University College London, and author of Hothouse Earth: An Inhabitant’s Guide. “A 1.5-degree C global average temperature rise is rightly equated with the dangerous climate change guardrail.”

Though he bristles at the doomer label, that doesn’t mean McGuire minces his grim outlook of the future. It might not be full-blown doomer but it’s certainly doomer adjacent. “In order to stay below 1.5 C, emissions need to fall by 45 percent in the next seven and a bit years,” he explained. “This is now practically impossible, so the world is now committed to dangerous, all-pervasive, climate breakdown.”

Much of doomer discourse could also be seen as an evolution from climate misinformation into another cynical way to create excuses for ravaging the Earth. After all, if everything is hopeless and there’s no point, why not just continue to raze the rainforests for cattle grazing and drill for oil in the Arctic?

“ The risk is that if people really feel like there's nothing to be done, and we're already on the ‘highway to hell,’ then what's the point of doing anything? Just let it all burn it all, baby. ” — Andrew Dessler, Texas A&M

This can create a sense of complacency. It’s learned helplessness at its most extreme and consequential. Sure, it’s great for lining the pockets of fossil fuel executives—but it’s life-threatening for all of us.

“Anecdotally, I have noticed a pretty sharp shift in the comments I receive in response to climate change communications from the usual climate misinformation and trolling remarks to now climate doomerism,” Zachary Labe, a climate scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Program at Princeton University.

If you talk to any climate scientist, though, most of them will tell you while things can most certainly get worse, there is still a lot of runway to avoid complete and utter disaster. In fact, doomer messaging obfuscates the reality that we can do something about this—but we all have to do it together. If we fall prey to doomerism, then we might let everything burn down for no good reason at all.

“The risk is that if people really feel like there’s nothing to be done, and we’re already on the ‘highway to hell,’ then what’s the point of doing anything? Just let it all burn, baby,” Andrew Dessler, the director for the Texas Center for Climate Studies at Texas A&M University, told The Daily Beast. “That’s clearly the risk. It’s reasonable when people say that that kind of rhetoric doesn’t motivate people to act in ways that are effective at reducing emissions.”

Nor does Dessler believe that such a pessimistic approach is accurate. Yes, things are bad—but they aren’t as bad as people necessarily make out. Sure, we’re on the highway to hell now and the road is getting rough, but at least we still have our hands on the wheel.

“I am quite convinced that we still control how bad it’s going to be,” he said. “We control whether we’re on the ‘highway to hell’ or not. There’s a lot of positive news in the energy world, and that we just need to build on that.”"

The conference, being held at the Sharm el-Sheikh resort, ran into an extra day as negotiators from nearly 200 countries struggled to reach a 'loss and damage' agreement to help poorer countries affected by the effects of global warming.

Nations from the developing world claimed they should receive compensation from Western countries for damage such as the recent floods in Pakistan.

These countries put little of the heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere, they claimed.

Irish environment minister Eamon Ryan, one of the lead negotiators, said: 'These negotiations won't work if it's pitching one country against another. The only way it will work is if we sit down in collaboration.'

The outcome of the 12-day event is being seen as a test of global resolve to tackle climate change and continue the work of the COP26 summit that was held in Glasgow last year.

A COP27 draft agreement that was released yesterday reaffirmed past commitments, including those made at Glasgow, to limit global warming to 1.5C.

But reports said there was little sign of the necessary ambition to make the emissions cuts required to reach that goal.

Earlier, Frans Timmermans, the European Union's climate policy chief, had warned that the EU was prepared to 'walk away' from negotiations if the final accord was not ambitious enough."
2c57eb91-59f7-48e5-862a-552d27cfd85e,"OPINION:

Environmentalists attending the United Nations’ annual climate conference are facing a steep challenge — and it’s not rising temperatures. Rather, it’s persuading the world community to cut back further on fossil fuel usage at a time when energy shortages could make this winter particularly deadly. Despite the current craze over “green” ideology, smart policies can only be ones that ensure human survivability.

Representatives of 190 nations who flocked to Egypt’s Sharm el-Sheikh resort town for the U.N. COP27 climate summit arrived forewarned. The conference chairman, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, had already lowered expectations that nations would remain steadfast in embracing the U.N. goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. “It is more fragile, because of the impact of the current global situation,” he told the Guardian.

Indeed, since last year’s climate conference in Scotland, the “global situation” has devolved, with a worldwide pestilence giving way to a shockingly destructive Eurasian war. In particular, Vladimir Putin’s callous scheme of shutting off natural gas for Europe in the hope of crushing resistance to his Ukraine invasion has served as a jarring reminder that modern civilization crumbles without sufficient energy to operate it.

In Germany’s Westphalia, a wind turbine farm is being dismantled to make room for a lignite coal mine expansion. With no Russian gas to keep Germans warm this winter, the decision was quickly made to swap clean but intermittent wind for carbon-based but reliable coal. If officials had “given in to the demands of the fossil fuel industry,” as one critic characterized the move, they did it to keep citizens alive. Who can blame them?

In Britain, 10% inflation is worsened by an average increase in household energy bills of 80%, with more hikes to come with the onset of cold weather. Unsurprisingly, newly minted Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has announced that he’s skipping the U.N.’s anti-carbon confab. “I just think, at the moment, it’s right that I’m also focusing on the ­depressing domestic challenges we have with the economy,” he says.

Those challenges include the likelihood of cold-caused death owing to energy poverty. A 2015 study published in the European Journal of Public Health found that between 2002 and 2011, Britain averaged 29,000 excess deaths due to winter cold. The loss of Russian gas is expected to multiply the loss of life.

President Biden has preceded his appearance at COP27, slated for Nov. 11, with threats to impose a windfall profits tax on U.S. oil companies. They have indeed reaped record revenue on the current high fuel prices. Mr. Biden has only himself to blame, though: His relentless war on fossil fuels has made supplies so dear that he has begged OPEC, unsuccessfully, for more oil.

The president is a vocal proponent of the U.N.’s climate agenda, but Americans aren’t listening. A recent Gallup survey places climate change dead last among top voter concerns heading into the midterm elections.

With life-sustaining energy in short supply, only the coldhearted would choose “green” ideology over human survivability."
7fbb30c9-eafe-461d-a220-1ab6a66e5537,"If it wasn’t literally your job to cover it, you’d be forgiven for missing this year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP27. The convergence of flashy news items—Elon Musk taking control of Twitter and promptly unleashing chaos throughout the company, the U.S. midterm elections, even the implosion of a major cryptocurrency exchange—leave little remaining oxygen for an annual climate conference.

And, if we’re being honest, the two-week gathering of world leaders in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, hasn’t had much going for it. Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin, the respective leaders of China and Russia, were not in attendance, even as the environmental impacts of U.S.-China relations and the war in Ukraine took center-stage. Greta Thunberg was also absent but accused conference attendees of “greenwashing, lying and cheating.” Indeed, some of the biggest climate news to come out of the past week didn’t even happen at the conference, like Monday’s announcement that Xi and U.S. President Joe Biden had agreed to restart climate talks between their two countries.

It’s clear that COP27 is no COP21, the 2015 conference held in Paris that led to the signing of the Paris Agreement. Instead, experts told The Daily Beast that this year’s COP will go down in infamy as the year the conference was revealed to be a true farce.

“ It seems like Egypt is the nail in the coffin for environmental activists and those truly invested in transformative climate action and justice. ” — Mohammed Rafi Arefin, University of British Columbia

“It seems like Egypt is the nail in the coffin for environmental activists and those truly invested in transformative climate action and justice, and not just these small adjustments that seem to be getting us nowhere,” Mohammed Rafi Arefin, a geography and climate justice researcher at the University of British Columbia, told The Daily Beast..

He pointed to a slew of contradictions, including ongoing environmental destruction by the Egyptian government and the ongoing imprisonment of a prominent political activist, Alaa Abd El Fattah. Recent reports have highlighted other hypocrisies, such as a glut of fossil fuel lobbyists present at this year’s meeting, a year after the industry’s already outsized presence was uniformly criticized. Over a hundred more lobbyists registered for COP27, according to an analysis released last week by the international nonprofit Global Witness.

“After it was called out last year, how does this actually still happen?” Kat Maier, a national coordinator for Fridays For Future U.S., told The Daily Beast. That Hill+Knowlton, a PR firm that represents fossil fuel companies, is leading communications at the conference and Coca-Cola, one of the world’s leading plastics polluters, is hosting, only deepens activists’ skepticism about the meeting.

The core problem is that the people who have seats at the table overwhelmingly do not represent the interests of everybody else. Another report from NGO Oxfam International released to coincide with COP27 analyzed the emissions directly due to billionaires’ investments when they held 10 percent or higher stakes in a corporation. It found that 125 of the world’s richest billionaires each emit one million times more carbon annually than a person in the bottom 90 percent economically on average.

“A lot of the solutions have to be systemic,” Ashfaq Khalfan, director of climate justice at Oxfam America and one of the authors of the new report, told The Daily Beast. “But a lot of billionaires’ personal emissions are a matter of choice, and particularly with their investments, that's a very tangible way that they are choosing to invest in polluting industries.”

Billionaires, Khalfan said, have outsized economic and political influence—they both make up a disproportionate number of world leaders and have sway over the rest as donors, advisers, and private citizens. Additionally, their status affords them a buffer to climate-induced disasters that are ravaging millions around the globe. It’s no wonder then that their sense of urgency and ideas about climate policies showcased at COP27 feel out of touch at best.

The result of hypocrisies and others, like rich nations’ failure to keep a $100 billion pledge to developing countries for climate adaptation and mitigation, is that “inconsistency and greenwashing” is on display this year, said Ioannis Ioannou, a strategy and entrepreneurship researcher at London Business School. When companies are given a larger platform than they deserve at the conference, it’s important to remember how their tenets may contradict the stated purpose of the COPs and drown out crucial marginalized perspectives.

“This is the only forum we have where each country should have an equal voice, and unfortunately, it is becoming a bit of a peacock competition,” Ioannou told The Daily Beast.

It’s clear that COP27 represents the beginning of a tailspin, but where we go from here depends on whether we want to jump out of the plane or try desperately to correct course, experts said. It would take an unprecedented international effort to move away from the COPs, Ioannou said, along the same lines as what would be needed for a “New Bretton Woods,” the post-World War II conference that created the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

“Can we come up with institutions that have science at their core, as opposed to science in an advisory role, which seems to be what we have now?” Ioannou said. “Moving beyond the COPs, are there more long-term oriented, science-based, democratic, inclusive institutional structures? Because that's what is needed to match the problem of climate change.”

Others like Khalfan said that reinventing the wheel at such a large scale is not likely to succeed, and that a best-case scenario is that leaders resuscitate a future conference with the ingredients that allowed the Paris Agreement to take shape. As most nations come to the annual meeting to coordinate, having made climate decisions ahead of time, countries that want to lead the conversation could innovate ahead of the curve by decarbonizing their economies; then, after they’ve shown it can be done, leaders can manufacture viral moments and spearhead change by calling out other nations reluctant to follow their lead, Khalfan said.

In 2015, small island developing states banded together and pushed for a goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius instead of 2. Even though we are going to overshoot this goal, the intention that was agreed upon at COP21 mattered, Khalfan argued.

“One is absolutely catastrophic. One is just catastrophic,” he said.

Giving smaller nations and ones hard-hit by the effects of climate change greater bargaining power goes hand in hand with limiting external influences, Maier added.

“There are a few crucial decisions that could completely transform the way that this platform is used,” she said, including rethinking sponsorships and kicking out fossil fuel lobbyists who would prefer to keep to the status quo.

Because if this year is any indication, what the “status quo” means is that leaders at COP27 are fiddling while the world burns."
0b76e9a3-0eac-457f-bb39-e4327a77c608,"In richer nations, meanwhile, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the risk of recession has thrown efforts to shift away from fossil fuels into reverse. A scramble for non-Russian energy supplies has extended the life of European coal plants.

Some climate finance is also heading in the wrong direction. Cross-border climate investments that boomed in 2021 are now on track to decline. Blended finance deals that use public funds to make green investments more attractive to private investors have nosedived. So has support for some shareholder climate resolutions at oil groups such as BP and Shell.

Vital tipping point

The list goes on. So what grounds are there for optimism?

One big reason: governments and regulators that have been missing in climate action are finally getting serious, and taking unprecedented steps that would have been unthinkable even a year ago. This is most notable in the US, where in August, President Joe Biden signed into law the most significant climate legislation in US history: the Inflation Reduction Act.

It could have been bigger and some of its $US370 billion worth of support for electric cars and other green tech is unhelpfully protectionist. Still, it is finally possible to imagine a time when the power of green moguls and green jobs is impossible to ignore, with big knock-on effects.

The US law has already spurred calls for the EU to ramp up backing for technologies such as green hydrogen. And the EU itself shows why the International Energy Agency said last week the war in Ukraine could ultimately hasten the clean energy transition.

To wean itself off Russian fossil fuels, Brussels has unveiled RepowerEU, a sweeping €210 billion ($325 billion) plan to boost green energy. It’s still a blueprint, but it is also a stark shift from a year ago. Likewise, Ukraine did not stop a record $US226 billion ($356 billion) of new renewable energy investment globally in the first six months of 2022, led by China.

In a way, though, it is more striking to see what corporate regulators are suddenly doing. Two weeks ago, the UK’s advertising watchdog banned a set of HSBC adverts for greenwashing, the first move of its kind. Another first came a week later when Australia’s corporate watchdog fined an energy company $53,280 for exaggerating its green credentials.

This has happened as EU countries including France, Spain and Poland have suddenly decided to quit the 28-year-old Energy Charter Treaty, a contentious trade and investment accord that campaigners have long claimed stymies climate action.

None of this gets us close to the 45 per cent fall in emissions needed by 2030 to keep the 1.5 degrees temperature goal alive. But it could be a sign that we are nearing vital political tipping points. A growing body of research suggests sweeping social change can be unleashed once 25 per cent of a population is pushing for such a shift. Rising concern about the climate must be bringing that threshold closer in many places.

Either way, it is clearer than ever that the climate burden falls heavily on those least able to bear it, so every tenth of a degree of warming matters. Pessimism may feel unavoidable, but caving into defeatism is ultimately a luxury that vanishingly few can afford.

Russia's war on Ukraine has cast a shadow over this year's United Nations climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, where officials from around the world are discussing the costs of climate change and how to cut emissions that remain near record highs.

The war has dramatically disrupted energy markets the world over, leaving many countries vulnerable to price spikes amid supply shortages.

Europe, worried about keeping the heat on through winter, is outbidding poor countries for natural gas, even paying premiums to reroute tanker ships after Russia cut off most of its usual natural gas supply. Some countries are restarting coal-fired power plants. Others are looking for ways to expand fossil fuel production, including new projects in Africa.

These actions are a long way from the countries' pledges just a year ago to rein in fossil fuels, and they're likely to further increase greenhouse gas emissions, at least temporarily.

But will the war and the economic turmoil prevent the world from meeting the Paris climate agreement's long-term goals?

There are reasons to believe that this may not be the case.

The answer depends in part on how wealthy countries respond to a focus of this year's climate conference: fulfilling their pledges in the Paris Agreement to provide support for low- and middle-income countries to build clean energy systems.

Europe speeds up clean energy plans

A key lesson many countries are taking away from the ongoing energy crisis is that, if anything, the transition to renewable energy must be pushed forward faster.

Credit: The Conversation

I work with countries as they update national climate pledges and have been involved in evaluating the compatibility of global emissions reduction scenarios with the Paris Agreement. I see the energy crisis affecting countries' plans in different ways.

About 80% of the world's energy is still from fossil sources. Global trade in coal, oil and natural gas has meant that even countries with their own energy supplies have felt some of the pain of exorbitant prices. In the U.S., for example, natural gas and electricity prices are higher than normal because they are increasingly tied to international markets, and the U.S. is the world's largest exporter of liquefied natural gas.

The shortage has led to a scramble to find fossil fuel suppliers in the short term. European countries have offered to help African countries produce more natural gas and have courted authoritarian regimes. The Biden administration is urging companies to extract more oil and gas, has tried to pressure Saudi Arabia to produce more oil, and considered lifting sanctions against Venezuela.

However, Europe also has a growing renewable energy supply that has helped cushion some of the impact. A quarter of the European Union's electricity comes from solar and wind, avoiding billions of euros in fossil fuel costs. Globally, investments in the clean energy transition increased by about 16% in 2022, the International Energy Agency estimates.

Developing countries face complex challenges

If Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a wake-up call to accelerate the clean energy transition in wealthier countries, the situation is much more complex in developing countries.

Low-income countries are being hit hard by the impact of Russia's war, not only by high energy costs, but also by decreases in grain and cooking oil exports. The more these countries are dependent on foreign oil and gas imports for their energy supply, the more they will be exposed to global market gyrations.

Renewable energy can reduce some of that exposure.

The costs of solar and wind energy have dropped dramatically in the last decade and now represent the cheapest sources of energy in most regions. But advances in expanding access to clean electricity have been set back by the war. Borrowing costs can also be a barrier for low-income countries, and those costs will increase as countries raise interest rates to fight inflation.

As part of the Paris Agreement, wealthy countries were supposed to make good on promises to make US$100 billion per year available for climate finance, but the actual amounts provided have fallen short.

To achieve the Paris Agreement targets, coal, oil and natural gas consumption must decrease dramatically in the next decade or two. International cooperation will be necessary to help poorer countries expand energy access and transition to low-emissions development pathways.

Africa's fossil fuels and stranded asset risks

A number of developing countries have their own fossil fuel resources, and some in Africa have been calling for increasing production, although not without pushback.

Without a strong alternative within local contexts for sustainable energy resources, and with wealthy countries scrambling for fossil fuels, developing countries will exploit fossil resources—just as the wealthiest countries have done for over a century. For example, Tanzania's energy minister, January Makamba, told Bloomberg during the U.N. climate conference that his country expects to sign agreements with Shell and other oil majors for a $40 billion liquefied natural gas export project.

While this intersection of interests could boost some developing countries, it can also set up future challenges.

Encouraging the construction of new fossil-fuel infrastructure in Africa—presumably to be earmarked for Europe in the short to medium term—may help ameliorate some near-term supply shortages, but how long will those customers need the fuel? And how much of that income will benefit the people of those countries?

The IEA sees natural gas demand plateauing by 2030 and oil and coal demand falling, even without more ambitious climate policies. Any infrastructure built today for short-term supplies risks becoming a stranded asset, worthless in a low-emissions world.

Encouraging developing countries to take on debt risk to invest in fossil fuel extraction for which the world will have no use would potentially do these countries a great disservice, taking advantage of them for short-term gain.

The world has made progress on emissions in recent years, and the worst warming projections from a decade ago seem to be highly unlikely now. But every tenth of a degree has an impact, and the current ""business-as-usual"" path still leads the planet toward warming levels with climate change costs that are hard to contemplate, especially for the most vulnerable countries. The outcomes from the climate conference will give an indication of whether the global community is willing to accelerate the transition.

COP27 began on Sunday and I’m following the action. By action, I mean 12 days of mind-numbing meetings, speeches, and virtue signaling, spiced up with misrepresentations of scientific research and data.

COP stands for Conference of the Parties. The parties in question do not feature beer, dancing, and flirting. The term refers to the 197 governments that began getting together back in 1992 for United Nations “climate summits.” This COP, the 27th, is taking place in Sharm el-Sheik, a posh Egyptian resort on the Red Sea.

In 2015, 194 countries signed the Paris Agreement, pledging to “pursue efforts” to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

Bjorn Lomborg, president of the Copenhagen Consensus Center, has written extensively on why such efforts are bound to fail, while policies facilitating adaptation to climate change could succeed.

But the Paris signatories are adamant about limiting or eliminating hydrocarbons such as oil, gas, and coal, thereby reducing emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2).

Is CO2 a pollutant? Every time you exhale, you emit CO2. And, for our friends, the trees and the flowers, CO2 is essential food.

The theory embraced by Paris signatories is that as CO2 builds up in the atmosphere, it traps heat causing temperatures to rise. The question that follows: How quickly and how high?

Forecasting the weather next Sunday is tough. Using computer models to predict average temperatures decades from now is tougher.

What we do know is that since 1900 global temperatures have risen 1.3 degrees Celsius. Over that time and “despite that warming, we’ve seen the greatest improvement ever in the human condition,” notes Steve Koonin who served as Under Secretary for Science in the Department of Energy under President Obama and is the author of “Unsettled: What Climate Science Tells Us, What It Doesn’t, and Why It Matters.”

In an email, to me, he added: “Longevity, literacy, nutrition, and economic activity all increased dramatically even as the population quintupled, and the rate of extreme poverty plummeted from 70 percent to 10 percent. Importantly, today’s death rate from extreme weather is 1/50th of what it was in 1900. It beggars belief that comparable warming over the next hundred years will significantly derail that progress.”

But couldn’t future warming be much more severe? A few years ago, it was widely accepted that the world was heading for a 4-degree temperature rise. The U.N. now predicts 2.5 degrees – hardly fire and brimstone.

A U.N. statement from 2014: “For most economic sectors, the impact of climate change will be small relative to the impacts of other drivers.”

What have we learned since? “Subsequent research confirms that warming is expected to be a minor drag on growth,” Mr. Koonin added. Bottom line: “The term ‘existential crisis’ is not justified.”

Such good news will not be heard at the COP. The world is “on a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator!” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres thundered in his opening remarks.

Also unlikely to receive attention: The failure of expensive efforts to substitute “renewables,” meaning wind and solar power, for hydrocarbons.

Energy expert Robert Bryce, citing data from the BP Statistical Review of World Energy, recently pointed out that “wind and solar are not making a significant dent in our insatiable thirst for oil, gas, and coal.”

That’s because windmills produce energy only when breezes blow. Solar panels provide energy only when the sun shines. Neither produces large amounts of energy and both take up vast amounts of land – to the detriment of nature and agriculture. Both also require raw materials that must be mined, often in ways that are hardly “green.”

Nor do we yet have batteries capable of storing significant quantities of energy. This means Mr. Bryce says: “Wind and solar simply cannot provide the staggering scale of energy the world needs at prices consumers can afford.”

China’s ruler, Xi Jinping, apparently recognizes this reality along with the indivisible link between abundant energy and prosperity. So, he’s not attending COP27, and he is producing and burning much more coal. The result: If all Americans traded in their gas guzzlers for Teslas tomorrow, global CO2 emissions would not drop.

The current COP is the fifth to be held in Africa. The idea is to draw attention to the “severe impact of climate change on the continent.” But a few degrees of warming over decades are unlikely to harm Africans as much as restricting or even raising the price of the energy they need and for which there is no current substitute.

Give an African farmer a tractor running on diesel, and he can grow more crops. If he has a truck that runs on gasoline, he can get his produce to the market where he can sell it at a profit. If his families’ meals are cooked over a propane flame, that’s better for them – and the environment – than if they’re cooked over wood or dung. But deprive Africans of affordable, reliable hydrocarbons and you condemn them to abject poverty.

The COP remedy: Rich countries writing checks to poor countries. In 2009, the former committed to giving the latter $100 billion a year to help them reduce emissions and prepare for climate change. They have not yet made good on that pledge.

That’s no great loss if you expect – as I do – most of that money to end up in the pockets of ruling elites.

If COP27 attendees are adamant about reducing CO2 emissions, there are better ways to do it. For example: Burning natural gas in place of coal cuts emissions roughly in half. Nuclear energy is emissions-free.

Why are so few climate activists pushing for such alternatives? That’s fodder for a future column.

5c4d4eef-e9a2-4a4a-a64d-03b2fd94341e,"PROVIDENCE, R.I. (Project Syndicate)—This week’s United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) in Egypt highlights the growing consensus that multilateral cooperation is necessary to avert environmental catastrophe. But with geopolitical tensions spiking and the U.S.-China rivalry heating up, such efforts seem doomed to fail, much like previous efforts to promote global coordination on vaccines, trade, technological innovation, and macroeconomic policy.

The good news is that the consensus may be wrong: A lack of multilateral cooperation need not be fatal to the climate cause. The existing frameworks for international coordination are outdated anyway, and technological competition, fueled by the United States’ climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), may prove to be a more potent driver of innovation, ensuring that the fight against climate change continues apace.

Cash for cuts

So far, the main framework for promoting multilateral cooperation on climate change has relied on the principle of “cash for cuts,” whereby developed countries offer financial aid to persuade developing countries to launch ambitious decarbonization efforts. But this approach is no longer credible, given that the international community has failed to meet its financial commitments and has shown no sign of improving.

“ Given the urgency of the existential threat posed by climate change, a global rush to subsidize key technologies seems like a feature, not a bug. ”

Worse, the “cash for cuts” paradigm is premised on a double standard.

While lower-income countries are asked to reduce emissions, rich countries are increasing their reliance on fossil fuels, particularly in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Moreover, the European Union’s planned border tax on carbon-intensive imports would effectively punish lower-income countries in Africa and elsewhere, limiting their own clean-energy transition. The EU’s carbon border adjustment mechanism essentially foists developed-world policies on poorer countries, making it tantamount to climate imperialism.

Technology to the rescue

Fortunately, rapid technological advances have sharply reduced the price of renewables bringing decarbonization within financial reach. That is why some developing countries, notably India and China, have embarked on massive renewable-energy programs over the past decade.

Nonetheless, given the need for massive investments in renewable-energy infrastructure and already-elevated storage costs, the transition to a net-zero economy is still not financially viable. Moreover, the transition would dislocate millions of people in developing countries who earn their living from fossil fuels, leading to enormous adjustment costs. Underestimating these costs or believing that these problems will resolve themselves is another, subtler form of climate imperialism.

While multilateral cooperation in the fight against climate change seems unlikely, America’s new IRA could be a global game-changer. By subsidizing renewable-energy research and development, it would obviate the need for onerous and inequitable carbon-taxation mechanisms.

A more hopeful narrative

More to the point, such measures would help create a new, hopeful narrative that focuses on mitigating climate change through technological innovation and boosting supply, rather than sacrifice and reduced demand. Like the U.S., few developing countries are likely to “carbon tax” their way to emissions reductions.

The IRA could also help lower-income countries to reduce the costs of decarbonization by encouraging the deployment of technologies such as low-cost batteries and carbon capture and storage. In our book “Greenprint,” Aaditya Mattoo and I argue that by making greater use of these technologies, developing countries could meet their energy needs without increasing global climate emissions.

The IRA is essentially a protectionist trade and industrial policy. As such, it could spark an international arms race of green-energy subsidies. But that might be a good thing. A global subsidy war could spur technological innovation, potentially driving down the price of renewables. Moreover, it may do for new technologies what China’s subsidies for photovoltaics did for the global solar-energy industry.

As many have warned, the IRA is not without risks. President Joe Biden’s signature legislation links many of its subsidies and incentives to production and research in the U.S. and North America. It thus constitutes what the World Trade Organization calls “local content requirements.” The EU, one of America’s biggest trading partners, has complained about this barrier to trade.

But, given the urgency of the existential threat posed by climate change, a global rush to subsidize key technologies seems like a feature, not a bug. To the extent that a global subsidies race could make clean energy financially viable, it would save rich countries the charade of committing to provide trillions of dollars to poorer countries that they cannot raise.

Finally, such a race could help resolve developing countries’ grievances about the rich world’s climate hypocrisy. Driving down renewable-energy costs would be a global public good provided by the developed world—assuming, of course, that whatever new technologies emerge would be freely available.

The unequal global rollout of COVID-19 vaccines should serve as a reminder that the mere invention of new technologies does not guarantee an equitable distribution.

Green Revolution model

The Green Revolution of the 1960s, when industrialized countries significantly reduced global hunger and poverty by introducing high-yield crops across the developing world, is a useful model for distributing cheap, nonproprietary renewable technologies. But to achieve a green revolution for the 21st century, the world must move beyond stale and divisive discussions about which countries are responsible for the climate threat.

Given today’s geopolitical rivalries, efforts to strengthen multilateral cooperation on climate change are likely to be futile. But competitive technological progress, even if promoted by protectionist policies, could save the planet.

Special to The Columbus DIspatch USA TODAY NETWORK

We are nearing the midpoint of the annual meeting of the 197 countries that signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992 or later. This 27th Conference of the Parties (COP27), in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, will last two weeks.

That original Framework aimed to hold global temperatures to no more than 2℃ (3.6℉) above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. The 2015 Paris agreement lowered that target to 1.5℃ (2.7℉). The world is already 1.1℃ (2.0℉) above pre-industrial levels. That trend is rising.

Twenty-three, rich developed countries have emitted half of all historical human greenhouse gases. Over 150 other, less well-developed, poor countries have emitted the rest. Many of those poorer countries, including some that have emitted the least, are suffering the most current climate change damages.

Pakistan, for example, received almost twice its normal amount of “monsoon” rainfall in June-August this year. Floods covered one-third of the country, and much of it remains flooded.

Flooding killed over 1,700 Pakistanis, about half of them children. Floods displaced 33 million people, one in every seven Pakistanis. Damages have reached $40 billion, more than 10% of Pakistan’s entire GDP.

The rapidly advancing technique of climate change attribution suggests that periods of Pakistan’s monsoon were 75% more-intense than they would have been without human caused climate change.

The monsoon flooding was preceded by unprecedented heat waves in April that triggered a glacial lake outburst. That threatened crop yields and damaged crucial infrastructure.

For all of this, Pakistan contributed less than one half of one percent of all historical, human-caused global greenhouse gas emissions.

Pakistan currently chairs the Group of 77 (G77) at the United Nations. Originally founded by 77 developing nations, the group has expanded to include 134 countries. The G77 successfully petitioned to add for the first time in COP meeting history an agenda item to discuss “Matters relating to funding arrangements responding to loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change, including a focus on addressing loss and damage.”

Efforts to address the disproportionate impact of climate change on poor, developing nations led developed countries, including the United States, to pledge a total of $100 billion a year by 2020 and until at least 2025. This “Green Fund” will address climate change mitigation and adaptation in poor nations experiencing the effects of climate change. Unfortunately, the developed countries have fallen short on their commitments to the fund.

Those same countries have hesitated to address explicitly “loss and damage” that Pakistan and similar countries experience. They don’t want to be held financially liable for climate change damages in other countries.

It’s increasingly difficult to call all climate change disasters, like those in Pakistan, as ""acts of God."" Climate change attribution studies make that increasingly clear. Those disasters were once unintended acts of humans emitting massive amounts of greenhouse gases since the start of the Industrial Age.

More recently, we have learned that greenhouse gas emissions from obtaining and burning fossil fuels causes climate disasters. We can no longer claim naiveté about the cause.

Even the Bible expects anyone who damages their neighbor’s property should make restitution (Luke 19:8-10).

Amen to that.

If it wasn’t literally your job to cover it, you’d be forgiven for missing this year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP27. The convergence of flashy news items—Elon Musk taking control of Twitter and promptly unleashing chaos throughout the company, the U.S. midterm elections, even the implosion of a major cryptocurrency exchange—leave little remaining oxygen for an annual climate conference.

And, if we’re being honest, the two-week gathering of world leaders in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, hasn’t had much going for it. Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin, the respective leaders of China and Russia, were not in attendance, even as the environmental impacts of U.S.-China relations and the war in Ukraine took center-stage. Greta Thunberg was also absent but accused conference attendees of “greenwashing, lying and cheating.” Indeed, some of the biggest climate news to come out of the past week didn’t even happen at the conference, like Monday’s announcement that Xi and U.S. President Joe Biden had agreed to restart climate talks between their two countries.

It’s clear that COP27 is no COP21, the 2015 conference held in Paris that led to the signing of the Paris Agreement. Instead, experts told The Daily Beast that this year’s COP will go down in infamy as the year the conference was revealed to be a true farce.

“It seems like Egypt is the nail in the coffin for environmental activists and those truly invested in transformative climate action and justice, and not just these small adjustments that seem to be getting us nowhere,” Mohammed Rafi Arefin, a geography and climate justice researcher at the University of British Columbia, told The Daily Beast..

He pointed to a slew of contradictions, including ongoing environmental destruction by the Egyptian government and the ongoing imprisonment of a prominent political activist, Alaa Abd El Fattah. Recent reports have highlighted other hypocrisies, such as a glut of fossil fuel lobbyists present at this year’s meeting, a year after the industry’s already outsized presence was uniformly criticized. Over a hundred more lobbyists registered for COP27, according to an analysis released last week by the international nonprofit Global Witness.

Story continues

“After it was called out last year, how does this actually still happen?” Kat Maier, a national coordinator for Fridays For Future U.S., told The Daily Beast. That Hill+Knowlton, a PR firm that represents fossil fuel companies, is leading communications at the conference and Coca-Cola, one of the world’s leading plastics polluters, is hosting, only deepens activists’ skepticism about the meeting.

The core problem is that the people who have seats at the table overwhelmingly do not represent the interests of everybody else. Another report from NGO Oxfam International released to coincide with COP27 analyzed the emissions directly due to billionaires’ investments when they held 10 percent or higher stakes in a corporation. It found that 125 of the world’s richest billionaires each emit one million times more carbon annually than a person in the bottom 90 percent economically on average.

“A lot of the solutions have to be systemic,” Ashfaq Khalfan, director of climate justice at Oxfam America and one of the authors of the new report, told The Daily Beast. “But a lot of billionaires’ personal emissions are a matter of choice, and particularly with their investments, that's a very tangible way that they are choosing to invest in polluting industries.”

Billionaires, Khalfan said, have outsized economic and political influence—they both make up a disproportionate number of world leaders and have sway over the rest as donors, advisers, and private citizens. Additionally, their status affords them a buffer to climate-induced disasters that are ravaging millions around the globe. It’s no wonder then that their sense of urgency and ideas about climate policies showcased at COP27 feel out of touch at best.

Should Wealthy Carbon Emitters Foot the Bill for Climate Damage?

The result of hypocrisies and others, like rich nations’ failure to keep a $100 billion pledge to developing countries for climate adaptation and mitigation, is that “inconsistency and greenwashing” is on display this year, said Ioannis Ioannou, a strategy and entrepreneurship researcher at London Business School. When companies are given a larger platform than they deserve at the conference, it’s important to remember how their tenets may contradict the stated purpose of the COPs and drown out crucial marginalized perspectives.

“This is the only forum we have where each country should have an equal voice, and unfortunately, it is becoming a bit of a peacock competition,” Ioannou told The Daily Beast.

It’s clear that COP27 represents the beginning of a tailspin, but where we go from here depends on whether we want to jump out of the plane or try desperately to correct course, experts said. It would take an unprecedented international effort to move away from the COPs, Ioannou said, along the same lines as what would be needed for a “New Bretton Woods,” the post-World War II conference that created the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

“Can we come up with institutions that have science at their core, as opposed to science in an advisory role, which seems to be what we have now?” Ioannou said. “Moving beyond the COPs, are there more long-term oriented, science-based, democratic, inclusive institutional structures? Because that's what is needed to match the problem of climate change.”

Others like Khalfan said that reinventing the wheel at such a large scale is not likely to succeed, and that a best-case scenario is that leaders resuscitate a future conference with the ingredients that allowed the Paris Agreement to take shape. As most nations come to the annual meeting to coordinate, having made climate decisions ahead of time, countries that want to lead the conversation could innovate ahead of the curve by decarbonizing their economies; then, after they’ve shown it can be done, leaders can manufacture viral moments and spearhead change by calling out other nations reluctant to follow their lead, Khalfan said.

Green Hypocrisy Hangs Over This Year’s U.N. Climate Meeting

In 2015, small island developing states banded together and pushed for a goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius instead of 2. Even though we are going to overshoot this goal, the intention that was agreed upon at COP21 mattered, Khalfan argued.

“One is absolutely catastrophic. One is just catastrophic,” he said.

Giving smaller nations and ones hard-hit by the effects of climate change greater bargaining power goes hand in hand with limiting external influences, Maier added.

“There are a few crucial decisions that could completely transform the way that this platform is used,” she said, including rethinking sponsorships and kicking out fossil fuel lobbyists who would prefer to keep to the status quo.

Because if this year is any indication, what the “status quo” means is that leaders at COP27 are fiddling while the world burns.

2689e393-d930-49ce-bf7d-070f08a72688,"The United Nations is betting that satellites could help the world catch up on emissions reductions. The organization has unveiled a Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) that, as the name implies, will warn countries and companies of ""major"" methane emission releases. The technology will use satellite map data to identify sources, notify the relevant bodies and help track progress on lowering this output.

The initial MARS platform will focus on ""very large"" energy sector sources. It'll gradually expand to include less powerful sources, more frequent alerts and data from animals, coal, rice and waste. Partners in the program, such as the International Energy Agency and UN's Climate and Clean Air Coalition, will provide help and advice. The information also won't remain a secret, as the UN will make both data and analyses public between 45 to 75 days after it's detected.

The system will get its early funding from the US government, European Commission, Bezos Earth Fund and the Global Methane Hub. Both Bezos' fund and GMH are backing related efforts, such as studies on spotting and counteracting agricultural methane emissions.

This is the first publicly available system of its kind, the UN claims. It will theoretically lead to faster, more targeted methane emissions reduction than you see today. That could be crucial in the years ahead. The UN warned at the COP27 conference that Earth was nowhere near limiting global warming to the 1.5 degrees Celsius from the Paris Agreement. As human-released methane is both a major contributor to climate change (about 25 percent, the UN says) and quick to leave the atmosphere, an effective use of MARS could help get environmental strategy back on track.

As you might imagine, though, MARS will only work if governments and businesses cooperate. There's not much point to alerts if emissions contributors ignore them. An oil company might be reluctant to spend the money need to fix its flaring, for instance. The UN can point out a problem using this system, but it can't require action."
d5bcba5e-cbf3-495d-b341-4b83783e937e,"The UN's environment watchdog says it will launch a public database of global methane leaks detected by space satellites - part of a new program to encourage companies and governments to curb emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas.

The system, dubbed MARS or Methane Alert and Response System, will build on a pledge signed by 119 countries since last year to cut methane emissions by 30 per cent this decade, a goal scientists say is crucial to averting extreme climate change.

""The Methane Alert and Response System is a big step in helping governments and companies deliver on this important, short-term climate goal,"" Inger Andersen, executive eirector of the UN Environment Program, said in a statement issued at the COP27 climate summit in Egypt on Friday.

""Reducing methane emissions can make a big and rapid difference, as this gas leaves the atmosphere far quicker than carbon dioxide.""

Methane, which has a much higher warming effect than carbon dioxide during its short lifespan, is responsible for about a quarter of the global rise in temperatures so far, scientists say.

The MARS system will rely on an existing network of space satellites to spot methane plumes around the globe, estimate how big they are, and identify the company or government responsible, UNEP said.

UNEP's International Methane Emissions Observatory will then share information about the leak with whoever is responsible in the hope they will find the cause of the leak and repair it.

After a period of 45-75 days, the observatory will release information about the leak, and the company or government response to it, to the public database, UNEP said.

The system will first focus on global oil and gas operations, among the biggest sources of methane, before gradually expanding to cover other industries like coal, waste, livestock, and rice.

The initiative will be funded in part by the United States and European Union governments, along with philanthropic organisations including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' Bezos Earth Fund and the Global Methane Hub, UNEP said.

US Special Climate Envoy John Kerry, who helped spearhead the Global Methane Pledge to cut methane emissions last year, called the new system ""critical"" to climate efforts.

""Cutting methane is the fastest opportunity to reduce warming and keep 1.5degC within reach, and this new alert and response system is going to be a critical tool for helping all of us deliver on the Global Methane Pledge,"" he said."

The war in Ukraine, which upended global energy markets, as well as an unrelenting spate of extreme weather events, such as ruinous flooding in Pakistan and record droughts in the Horn of Africa and Europe, loom large over COP27 in Egypt, where world leaders have called for urgent climate action.

The Ukraine conflict in particular has significantly disrupted decarbonization plans and brought into focus concerns around resilience and sovereignty when it comes to ongoing energy transition efforts.

The Deloitte Center for Sustainable Progress' report, Transform to React: Climate Policy in the New World Order aims to embolden government and business leaders alike to hold onto their decarbonization ambitions within this complex geopolitical and economic landscape. The report analyzes the economic impacts of geopolitical upheaval and offers proactive next steps for organizations to continue accelerating progress, even in light of global conflict.

The European Union has already taken several climate-related actions through new strategy and policy proposals, but government action alone won't be enough. The private sector has a pivotal role to play in driving the transition — and there are several key actions organizations can take to propel and enable the transformation.

1. Green the value chain

The economic sanctions and other government hardlines waged during the Russia/Ukraine war are illuminating companies' structural vulnerabilities—bringing about the need to restructure value chains as a result. By working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as an integral part of the restructuring process—from design to production and marketing to distribution—executives can more easily unlock major synergies, such as the launch of transformative products or meeting new environmental, social, and governance (ESG) metrics requirements from stakeholders.

2. Diversify energy and raw material sources

Diversification measures should go beyond reducing reliance on fossil fuels and look to other strategic raw materials and goods. This means not only shifting to cleaner energy and feedstock sources, but also establishing expanded and reliable supply lines in new markets, which can reduce current vulnerabilities and help minimize the impact of potential future disruptions (geopolitical or otherwise).

3. Innovate in line with the energy transition to build resilience

Innovation is at the heart of maintaining competitive edge as it replaces costly and inefficient processes with more effective ones. The pursuit of long-term efficiencies (such as economies of scale thanks to trends like the mass production of solar panel components) has helped in driving down prices of key renewable energy technologies and bolstered the recent acceleration of the energy transition.

Industry-driven initiatives have the ability, and industry leaders have the responsibility, to catalyze and accelerate progress in renewables, electrification, renewable and low-carbon hydrogen and hydrogen derivatives, as well as in the circular economy.

4. Modernize in alignment with sustainability goals

Industries should modernize to operate and thrive in a net-zero economy. The modernization process, through initiatives such as restructuring the value chain to increase resilience, can take years, but it presents a window of opportunity to align investment decisions with long-term sustainability goals. Including ESG aspects in investments of financial market players could also make a significant contribution here.

5. Leverage public-private collaboration

Organizations looking to quickly roll out transformative technologies and processes need an environment that sets them up for success—ranging from the availability of these technologies to the availability of sufficient capital and skilled labor.

Companies can proactively shape this environment and limit their macro and microeconomic vulnerabilities by pursuing more public-private partnership work. Such relationships can leverage incentives to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon future, creating employment and local economic benefits, while also reducing operational, permitting, and macroeconomic risks for the companies and investors.

6. Set the right direction for investments

Skyrocketing electricity, gas, and oil prices have led to high inflation rates in nearly all goods when their production requires (whether directly or indirectly) significant amounts of energy. This leaves some sections of the economy—such as automotive, transport, and chemicals—facing significantly higher costs, while others, like oil and gas companies, are generating windfall profits compared to the relatively stable markets of the pre-crisis periods.

While this incentivizes expanding production capacity in fossil fuels, industry leaders must take a long-term view that such investments could result in large-scale stranded assets or lock-in effects that would obstruct the path to a low-carbon economy. These additional profits should be invested in transformative technologies and systems to generate additional benefits for growth, jobs, and social welfare.

Companies have many options when it comes to how they can take action in this moment. One thing is clear—climate action cannot wait, and companies should not either.

But if there’s one thing COP27 has adequately highlighted, it’s the solid-as-concrete link between war and climate change.

The climate-conflict connection has been discussed mainly through the prism of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and its ensuing fallout. On Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed world leaders remotely and stressed that “there can be no effective climate policy” without world peace.

“Who will care, for example, about the amount of the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere if part of Europe or the Middle East and possibly northern Africa, God forbid, are covered by a radiation cloud after an accident in Zaporizhzhya?” he said, referring to the massive nuclear power plant that has come under fire during the war.

But while Russia’s invasion is the latest in global conflicts whose shadows loom over COP, it’s certainly not the first. And by now, researchers have a clear picture of how the war in Ukraine, and conflict writ large, invariably sets us back on meeting climate goals.

One way war’s devastation can be measured on the ground is in terms of the ecological destruction wrought as collateral damage. Since battlefields are often considered to be terrain, rather than natural ecosystems deserving protection, “ecosystem health and integrity are often neglected casualties of warfare,” wrote the authors of a 2015 study.

When these ecosystems are already rare, which is the case for steppe grasslands found in Ukraine, hostilities can endanger species and destroy rare habitats. With no way to regulate conservation, logging and other unsustainable activities can explode, further threatening limited resources.

In terms of resources, “Conflicts are very destructive,” Ore Koren, a political science researcher at Indiana University Bloomington, told The Daily Beast. In fact, “they're much more destructive than climate change in most areas,” driving human migration within and between countries.

Conflict displacement—when people flee their homes due to violence—outpaces climate displacement: According to a 2021 report by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 84 million people around the world were displaced as of mid-2021. That number is only rising.

Then there’s the environmental price of military equipment. Military aircraft today still largely run on fossil fuels, meaning that nations with large militaries emit massive amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. The U.S. Department of Defense uses tens of millions of barrels of fuel each year to power ships, vehicles, aircraft, and bases—making it the single largest institutional producer of greenhouse gases worldwide.

“ Although it may be possible to maintain peace without successful climate adaptation, successful climate adaptation is impossible in the absence of peace. ” — Halvard Buhaug, Peace Research Institute Oslo

There’s some suggestion that climate change and conflict feed into each other in a nasty feedback loop, though what drives warfare is much more complicated than the well-known manmade factors that lead to climate change, Koren said. Food scarcity, which can be impacted by climate variability, played a sizable role in the impetus for the Arab Spring—on the other hand, that same food scarcity could disincentivize conflict if one power could not feed their army, he added.

Given that the link between conflict and backtracking on climate goals is clear, though, more adaptation plans need to take “conflict proofing” into account, Halvard Buhaug, a political science researcher at Peace Research Institute Oslo, recently wrote. But without a stop to conflict, sustainable development is an unlikely aspiration.

“Although it may be possible to maintain peace without successful climate adaptation, successful climate adaptation is impossible in the absence of peace,” Buhaug wrote."
11e658be-a1b5-4ac2-8855-3bde0255ffea,Some say carbon markets are a tool to hit targets at the least cost to economies by allowing emissions to be traded away if they're too expensive or industrially impossible to eliminate.
ccf48240-2b11-4b6e-8090-62572e081f45,"International carbon markets are not top of mind when homes are under floodwaters or bones are being flushed out of coastal graveyards.

But a dry document known as Article 6 is drawing a crowd at the COP27 international climate negotiations in the Egyptian resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh.

For governments at the climate talks, net zero doesn't mean no emissions.

Rather, it means reducing greenhouse gas emissions where possible and using carbon credits if necessary.

Last year's talks in Glasgow agreed to support the emergence of a global carbon market but it remains contentious.

Some say carbon markets are a tool to hit targets at the least cost to economies by allowing emissions to be traded away if they're too expensive or industrially impossible to eliminate.

For critics, it's a market-based con to achieve national pledges without real cuts in emissions with definitions so broad they include everything from geo-engineering to planting trees.

Australia's industry-led Carbon Market Institute is at the climate conference pushing for clear and consistent international guidance to cut risk and ratchet up corporate climate ambition.

As it stands, Article 6 sets out how governments can use international carbon markets to transfer greenhouse gas emissions across borders.

Paragraph four, the so-called Article 6.4 Mechanism, includes rules and procedures.

Through this mechanism, a company in one country could reduce emissions and have those reductions credited so it could sell them to another company in another country.

That second company could use them for complying with their own emission reduction obligations, with many committed to net zero by 2050 or before.

The complication is how to treat those cuts in nationally determined tallies without double counting.

And officials overseeing the mechanism agreed overnight it's too complicated to finalise methods and details this year.

Supervisory body vice-chair Piotr Dombrowicki said in a statement the work on carbon removals and methodologies is highly complex.

He said they have advanced the work in Sharm el-Sheikh and will continue next year.

The body agreed to establish a ""roster of experts"" in accreditation, methodologies and climate policy.

Five meetings on Article 6.4 are scheduled for 2023, starting in Bonn in Germany in March.

The supervisory body remains tasked with building a market mechanism that assists in delivering the Paris Agreement goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees.

Meanwhile, financial institutions and companies are putting carbon markets to use, earning and trading credits that each represent a tonne of emissions taken out of the atmosphere.

Australia's new climate laws don't usher in international carbon trading but the Albanese government hasn't ruled it out.

And the unsolved questions of how and what carbon credits to count in national targets mean there's scope for Australia to broker a solution if it hosts talks in 2026.

Countries due to up their emissions reduction targets for 2035 might need to rely on nature-based projects.

But voluntary carbon markets are yet to align with these rules and ensure carbon projects for industrial decarbonisation have water-tight environmental benefits.

Australia's Climate Change Authority says it's in the national interest to lead the development of a high-integrity market.

Article 6 is about much more than least-cost abatement of emissions but the market is still evolving and could be for some time, according to the authority's recent review.

For companies, Glasgow's Article 6 rule book provided some welcome certainty.

But experts say further details are needed for supporting transfers between government and non-government actors and preventing double counting.

e55c9c89-e3cf-4a65-91b4-580e1fe70214,"Carbon emissions from fossil fuels will hit record levels this year, according to a comprehensive analysis. The finding represents a brutal contrast with the need to cut emissions by half by 2030 to restrict global heating to 1.5C and avoid the most devastating impacts of the climate crisis.

There is no sign of the decline needed, the researchers said, heaping further pressure on the countries whose representatives are meeting at the UN Cop27 climate summit in Egypt to deliver real and rapid action. Other scientists described the news as “bleak” and “deeply depressing”.

A glimmer of hope comes from assessment of emissions from the destruction of forests. These have been declining slowly over the last two decades, though largely because of more new trees being planted rather than fewer being felled.

When this decline is taken into account, global carbon emissions have been essentially flat since 2015. However, until emissions actually start falling, huge amounts of heat-trapping carbon dioxide are still being pumped into the atmosphere every year.

The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has made clear to world leaders at Cop27 this week what this means: “We are in the fight of our lives and we are losing. Our planet is fast approaching tipping points that will make climate chaos irreversible. We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator,” he said.

The analysis by the Global Carbon Project (GCP) uses multiple streams of data from the year to date to estimate emissions for 2022. It found fossil fuel related CO 2 is on course to rise by 1% to 36.6bn tonnes, the highest ever. More burning of oil products is the biggest contributor, mostly because of the continuing rebound of international aviation after the pandemic.

Continued emissions at this level would make 1.5C of global heating become more probable than not in the next decade, the researchers said. Reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050, as pledged by many countries, now requires an annual decrease comparable to the sharp fall in 2020 due to Covid-19 lockdowns.

Emissions from coal will return to the all-time peak seen in 2014, the analysis found. But unlike in the past, this is not driven by China but by India and the European Union. Gas burning remained level, but at the same record level seen in 2021.

Emissions from China, the world’s biggest polluter, will decrease by 1% in 2022, the GCP found, because of the country’s stringent Covid restrictions and a collapse in the construction industry. The EU will also see a similar decrease because the 7% rise in coal emissions has been offset by a 10% fall in CO 2 from gas consumption after Russia invaded Ukraine.

In contrast, US emissions will rise by 1.5%, with a surge in flights largely to blame. India will have the largest rise, 6%. This is due to higher coal and oil emissions, and India now emits more than the EU overall – although emissions per capita remain much lower.

“This year we see yet another rise in global fossil fuel CO 2 emissions, when we need a rapid decline,” said Prof Pierre Friedlingstein, a climate scientist at the University of Exeter who led the study. “Leaders at Cop27 will have to take meaningful action if we are to have any chance of limiting global warming close to 1.5C.”

“We are a very long way from where we need to go,” said Dr Glen Peters, a GCP member at the Centre for International Climate Research (Cicero) in Norway. “Many countries, cities, companies, and individuals have made pledges to reduce emissions. It is a stark reminder that despite all this rhetoric, global fossil CO 2 emissions are more than 5% higher than in 2015, the year of the Paris agreement.

“There is clearly no sign of the decrease needed to limit climate change close to 1.5C.”

Prof Corinne Le Quéré, at the University of East Anglia, who was also part of the study, noted that the average annual increase in emissions was 3% during the 2000s but has fallen to 0.5% rise in the past decade.

“We have shown climate policy does work,” she said. “If governments respond by turbo-charging clean energy investments and planting, not cutting down, trees, global emissions could rapidly start to fall.”

A series of reports released before Cop27 laid bare how close the planet is to climate catastrophe, with “no credible pathway” of carbon cuts to 1.5C in place. With targets already in agreed at previous summits, Cop27 is hoping to drive action but the disagreements over the provision of climate finance by rich countries is proving a major obstacle.

The GCP’s 2022 analysis is published in the journal Earth System Science Data and was produced by more than 100 scientists from 80 organisations around the world. The oceans and land absorb about half of humanity’s carbon emissions. However, the GCP found this vital service was increasingly damaged by global heating, with the uptake of CO 2 by the land and ocean reduced by 17% and 5% respectively over the last decade.

The GCP scientists are concerned about future emissions as well. “Given that a further recovery in oil use is expected in 2023, if coal or gas use remains flat or increases, then it is likely that global fossil CO 2 emissions will continue to rise in 2023 without a concerted policy effort,” said Robbie Andrew, a senior scientist at Cicero.

Prof Vanesa Castán Broto, at the University of Sheffield, said: “The results of the [analysis] are bleak. Carbon emissions are continuing to rise, and if this continues, climate change will reach a very destructive stage in a single decade.”

“The report is deeply depressing,” said Prof Mark Maslin, at University College London. “It sends a clear message to the leaders at Cop27 – the world needs to have significant cuts in global emissions in 2023 if we are to have any chance to keeping climate change to 1.5C.”"
7b035271-7f5f-4da6-919f-e6d579a991ff,"Global carbon dioxide emissions from all human activities remain at record highs in 2022, and fossil fuel emissions have risen above pre-pandemic levels, according to a new analysis by an international body of scientists.

The analysis, by the Global Carbon Project, calculates Earth’s “carbon budget”, which is how much CO₂ humans have released, and how much has been removed from the atmosphere by the oceans and land ecosystems. From there, we calculate how much carbon can still be emitted into the atmosphere before Earth exceeds the crucial 1.5℃ global warming threshold.

This year, the world is projected to emit 40.6 billion tonnes of CO₂ from all human activities, leaving 380 billion tonnes of CO₂ as the remaining carbon budget. This amount of emissions is disastrous for the climate – at current levels, there is a 50% chance the planet will reach the 1.5℃ global average temperature rise in just nine years.

We’ve seen significant progress towards decarbonisation and emission reduction from some sectors and countries, particularly in renewable electricity generation. Yet, as world leaders gather for the COP27 climate change summit in Egypt this week, the overall global effort remains vastly insufficient.

Humanity must urgently cut global emissions if we are to retain any hope of averting the most catastrophic impacts of climate change.

Global Carbon Project 2022

Coal and oil emissions up, gas down, deforestation slowing

Based on preliminary data, we project that CO₂ emissions from coal, natural gas, oil, and cement use (fossil emissions) will increase by 1% in 2022 from 2021 levels, reaching 36.6 billion tonnes. This means 2022 fossil emissions will be at an all-time high, and slightly above the pre-pandemic levels of 36.3 billion tonnes in 2019.

Let’s put the 2022 growth of 1% (or around 300 million metric tonnes) into perspective:

it’s the equivalent to adding an extra 70 million US cars to the world’s roads for a year

it’s higher than the 0.5% average yearly growth of the last decade (2012-2021)

but it’s smaller than the 2.9% average yearly growth during the 2000s (which was largely due to China’s rapid economic growth)

it’s also smaller than the 2.1% average yearly growth of the last 60 years.

So, in relative terms, the global growth in fossil CO₂ emissions is at least slowing down.

Read more: It’s the big issue of COP27 climate summit: poor nations face a $1 trillion ‘loss and damage’ bill, but rich nations won’t pay up

The growth in fossil emissions this year is largely due to higher oil and coal use – particularly oil, as the aviation industry is strongly bouncing back from the pandemic.

Coal emissions have also increased this year in response to higher natural gas prices and shortages in natural gas supply. Unexpectedly, there is the possibility that coal emissions this year will be higher than the historical peak in 2014.

Another major source of global CO₂ emissions is land-use change – the net balance between deforestation and reforestation. We project 3.9 billion tonnes of CO₂ will be released overall this year (though we should note that data uncertainties are higher for land-use change emissions than for fossil CO₂ emissions).

While land-use change emissions remain high, we’ve seen a slight decline over the past two decades largely due to increased reforestation. Rates of deforestation worldwide, however, are still high.

Together, fossil fuel and land-use change are responsible for 40.6 billion tonnes of CO₂.

Global Carbon Project 2022

Nations responding to multiple turmoils

The US and India are responsible for the largest increases in CO₂ fossil emissions this year.

US emissions are projected to increase by 1.5%. While natural gas and oil emissions are higher, emissions from coal continue on a long downward trend. India’s fossil CO₂ emissions are projected to increase by 6%, largely due to an increase in coal use.

Meanwhile, CO₂ emissions from fossil fuel sources in China and the European Union are projected to decline this year by 0.9% and 0.8%, respectively.

Read more: Tensions and war undermine climate cooperation – but there's a silver lining

China’s decline is mainly due to the nation’s continuing pandemic lockdowns, which have subdued economic activity. This includes a marked slowdown in the construction sector and its associated lower cement production.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is projected to lead to a 10% decline in the European Union’s CO₂ emissions from natural gas in 2022, as a result of supply shortages. The gas shortage has been partially replaced with greater coal consumption, leading to an increase of 6.7% in coal emissions in Europe.

The rest of the world accounts for 42% of global fossil CO₂ emissions, and this is expected to grow by 1.7% this year.

Indonesia, Brazil and the Democratic Republic of the Congo contribute 58% of global CO₂ emissions from net land-use change.

Natural carbon sinks get bigger, but feel the heat

Ocean and land act as CO₂ sinks. The ocean absorbs CO₂ as it dissolves in seawater. On land, plants absorb CO₂ and and build it into their trunks, branches, leaves and soils.

This makes ocean and land sinks a crucial part of regulating the global climate. Our data shows that on average, land and ocean sinks remove about half of all CO₂ emissions from human activities, acting like a 50% discount on climate change.

Read more: No more excuses: restoring nature is not a silver bullet for global warming, we must cut emissions outright

Despite this help from nature, the concentration of atmospheric CO₂ continues to climb. In 2022 it’ll reach a projected average of 417.2 parts per million. This is 51% above pre-industrial levels and higher than any time in the past 800,000 years.

Carbon sinks are getting larger because there is more CO₂ in the atmosphere for them to absorb. And yet, the impacts of climate change (such as overall warming, increased climate extremes, and changes in ocean circulation) have made land and ocean sinks, respectively, 17% and 4% smaller than they could have grown during 2012-2021.

There’s been significant progress this year in deployment of renewable energy, policy development, and commitments from governments and corporations to new, more ambitious climate mitigation targets.

We must urgently reach net-zero CO₂ emissions to keep global warming well below 2℃ this century. But humanity’s massive emissions in 2022 underscores the monumental and urgent task ahead."

By Kate Abnett

Global carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels are on track to rise around 1% this year, scientists said on Friday, warning this would make it harder for the world to avoid disastrous levels of climate change.

Released during the United Nations COP27 climate summit, the Global Carbon Budget report laid bare the gap between the promises governments, companies and investors have made to cut planet-warming emissions in future years, and their actions today - which cause emissions to keep rising.

Countries are expected to emit a total 41 billion tonnes of CO2 in 2022, said the report by more than 100 scientists, with 37 billion tonnes from burning fossil fuels and 4 billion tonnes from uses of land like deforestation.

This year's increase was driven by higher oil use in transport - paticularly aviation - as economies continued to reopen from lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Emissions from burning coal increased, as countries have turned to the most-polluting fossil fuel after Russia restricted natural gas supplies to Europe after its Feburary invasion of Ukrane, which sent global gas prices soaring.

CO2 output from China, the world's biggest polluter, fell by 0.9% as COVID-19 lockdowns persisted. European emissions also decreased slightly.

Emissions rose by 1.5% in the United States and jumped by 6% in India, the world's second and fourth-biggest emitters, respectively.

The U.N. climate science panel has said global greenhouse gases must decrease 43% by 2030 to limit global warming to 1.5C and avoid its most severe impacts.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused a record drop in global CO2 emissions in 2020, but emissions are now back up to slightly above pre-COVID-19 levels.

It is difficult to predict emissions in coming years due to uncertainties around countries' longer-term response to the pandemic and Russian gas crunch, for example, whether they keep burning coal, or instead invest heavily in clean energy.

""It's complicated,"" said the report's lead author Pierre Friedlingstein, climate scientist at the University of Exeter. ""We can't say for sure yet that emissions from China are declining in the long run... the return to use of coal in Europe, let's hope it's temporary.""

bcdfcd22-a98a-4e4f-918b-91c543227d5b,"The world remains dangerously off-course on climate action and there is no peak in sight for carbon emissions, which remain at record levels.

As leaders meet in Egypt to accelerate climate action, a new report shows the task of preventing catastrophic climate change is greater than ever.

There is no indication of when global emissions will peak, let alone enter a period of sustained decline.

If emissions levels persist, there is a 50-50 chance warming will exceed 1.5C in just nine years.

Total carbon emissions are expected to reach 40.6 billion tonnes this year, fuelled by a one per cent rise in fossil fuel emissions.

That is slightly higher than 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic temporarily pushed down emissions.

The world faces a herculean task to achieve zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Annual emissions must plunge like they did in 2020, when much of the world was locked down due to the pandemic.

""That's extraordinary, and hard to understand that it's plausible at all,"" says Pep Canadell, chief research scientist at the CSIRO and executive director of the Global Carbon Project.

The rise in emissions is largely due to higher oil use as international aviation rebounds from the pandemic. Coal use is also up.

However, natural gas is down because of supply issues sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Coal still accounts for 41 per cent of global emissions, oil 33 per cent, gas 22 per cent, and cement production makes up the rest.

And while renewable energy production is on the rise, it must accelerate to push out fossil-fuel power.

In terms of major emitters, this year is a mixed bag.

China's economic constraints will see emissions fall by 0.9 per cent, and the EU will also be down 0.8 per cent. However, the US will be up 1.5 per cent, along with India at 6 per cent, largely driven by coal.

Emissions from the rest of the world combined, including Australia, will be up by 1.7 per cent.

Australian National University professor Frank Jotzo says Australia is about halfway towards meeting the Albanese government's emissions reduction target of 43 per cent, on 2005 levels, by 2030.

""But of course much more than half the time - from 2005 to 2030 - has elapsed,"" he says.

For that reason, the reduction task is far greater for the eight years that lie ahead.

Then there is the fact that most of Australia's reductions so far have come from land use and forestry changes, rather than carbon-intensive industries.

However, Prof Jotzo says the 43 per cent target remains achievable.

""In fact, significantly stronger reductions could be achieved,'' he says.

""There's plenty of unharvested, low-hanging fruit after a decade of inaction on climate policy - energy efficiency, fuel switching, speeding up the decarbonisation of electricity.

""It requires effort, but it's readily achievable.""

The report is based on emissions data for the 10 months to October, and projections for the final two months of the year.

It has been launched at the COP27 climate change summit in Egypt."

Global carbon emissions in 2022 remain at record levels—with no sign of the decrease that is urgently needed to limit warming to 1.5°C, according to the Global Carbon Project science team.

If current emissions levels persist, there is now a 50% chance that global warming of 1.5°C will be exceeded in nine years.

The new report projects total global CO 2 emissions of 40.6 billion tons (GtCO 2 ) in 2022. This is fueled by fossil CO 2 emissions that are projected to rise 1.0% compared to 2021, reaching 36.6 GtCO 2 —slightly above the 2019 pre-COVID-19 levels. Emissions from land-use change (such as deforestation) are projected to be 3.9 GtCO 2 in 2022.

Projected emissions from coal and oil are above their 2021 levels, with oil being the largest contributor to total emissions growth. The growth in oil emissions can be largely explained by the delayed rebound of international aviation following COVID-19 pandemic restrictions.

The 2022 picture among major emitters is mixed: emissions are projected to fall in China (0.9%) and the EU (0.8%), and increase in the U.S. (1.5%) and India (6%), with a 1.7% rise in the rest of the world combined.

The remaining carbon budget for a 50% likelihood to limit global warming to 1.5°C has reduced to 380 GtCO2 (exceeded after nine years if emissions remain at 2022 levels) and 1230 GtCO2 to limit to 2°C (30 years at 2022 emissions levels).

To reach zero CO 2 emissions by 2050 would now require a decrease of about 1.4 GtCO 2 each year, comparable to the observed decrease in 2020 emissions resulting from COVID-19 lockdowns, highlighting the scale of the action required.

Land and ocean, which absorb and store carbon, continue to take up around half of the CO 2 emissions. The ocean and land CO 2 sinks are still increasing in response to the atmospheric CO 2 increase, although climate change reduced this growth by an estimated 4% (ocean sink) and 17% (land sink) over the 2012-2021 decade.

This year's carbon budget shows that the long-term rate of increasing fossil emissions has slowed. The average rise peaked at +3% per year during the 2000s, while growth in the last decade has been about +0.5% per year.

The research team—including the University of Exeter, the University of East Anglia (UEA), CICERO and Ludwig-Maximilian-University Munich—welcomed this slowdown, but said it was ""far from the emissions decrease we need.""

The findings come as world leaders meet at COP27 in Egypt to discuss the climate crisis.

""This year we see yet another rise in global fossil CO 2 emissions, when we need a rapid decline,"" said Professor Pierre Friedlingstein, of Exeter's Global Systems Institute, who led the study.

""There are some positive signs, but leaders meeting at COP27 will have to take meaningful action if we are to have any chance of limiting global warming close to 1.5°C. The Global Carbon Budget numbers monitor the progress on climate action and right now we are not seeing the action required.""

Professor Corinne Le Quéré, Royal Society Research Professor at UEA's School of Environmental Sciences, said, ""Our findings reveal turbulence in emissions patterns this year resulting from the pandemic and global energy crises. If governments respond by turbo-charging clean energy investments and planting—not cutting—trees, global emissions could rapidly start to fall. We are at a turning point and must not allow world events to distract us from the urgent and sustained need to cut our emissions to stabilize the global climate and reduce cascading risks.""

Land-use changes, especially deforestation, are a significant source of CO 2 emissions (about a tenth of the amount from fossil emissions). Indonesia, Brazil and the Democratic Republic of the Congo contribute 58% of global land-use change emissions.

Carbon removal via reforestation or new forests counterbalances half of the deforestation emissions, and the researchers say that stopping deforestation and increasing efforts to restore and expand forests constitutes a large opportunity to reduce emissions and increase removals in forests.

The Global Carbon Budget report projects that atmospheric CO 2 concentrations will reach an average of 417.2 parts per million in 2022, more than 50% above pre-industrial levels.

The projection of 40.6 GtCO 2 total emissions in 2022 is close to the 40.9 GtCO 2 in 2019, which is the highest annual total ever.

The Global Carbon Budget report, produced by an international team of more than 100 scientists, examines both carbon sources and sinks. It provides an annual, peer-reviewed update, building on established methodologies in a fully transparent manner.

6e019a29-70a6-4720-b232-a8baf1764ff9,"Global emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) have not decreased enough to meet the critical goal of limiting Earth's warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels, according to a new report authored by an international team of more than 100 scientists. In fact, average global temperatures are on track to cross that line within a decade, should warming continue at the current pace.

Achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 would now require annual CO2 decreases as drastic as those seen at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, when airplane flights were significantly reduced and economies were stalled.

""The emissions of CO2 that cause the planet to warm show no sign of decreasing,"" said Pierre Friedlingstein (opens in new tab), chair of mathematical modeling of climate systems at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom and lead author of the report. ""Actions over the past few years have been nowhere near enough to turn around the trajectory in global emissions,"" Friedlingstein told Live Science in an email. ""Much more needs to be done.""

The Global Carbon Budget report, published online Thursday (Nov. 10) in the journal Earth System Science Data (opens in new tab), is an annual update that tracks global CO2 emissions. The projections for 2022 are grim, estimating atmospheric CO2 at 417.2 parts per million (ppm) — 51% above preindustrial levels — and global emissions at 40.6 billion tons (36.8 billion metric tons). All figures in the report are projections, as the data cannot account for the final months of 2022.

As ever, the largest contributors are fossil fuels. Global oil use is up 2.2% from last year, largely due to the aviation industry's recovery after a COVID-19 slump. Coal use worldwide is also up 1%, while natural gas use has fallen slightly. But fossil fuel use is not uniform across nations; while emissions went up in the United States and India in 2022, emissions plummeted in China and the European Union, according to the report.

Increases in the U.S. are likely due to industries rebounding after COVID-19 slowdowns, the scientists wrote, while spikes in India are linked to that country's ongoing development. ""India has, by far, the most catch-up to do in terms of infrastructure, construction, and energy consumption per capita, all of which means rapid growth in energy consumption that cannot yet be covered entirely by renewable energy,"" said Jan Ivar Korsbakken (opens in new tab), a senior research fellow at the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research in Oslo, Norway, and co-author of the study.

Meanwhile, decreases in fossil fuel emissions from the EU may boil down to an economic slowdown that started in 2021 and only got worse when Russia invaded Ukraine, the study authors reported. Increased interest in solar power also may be playing a role. Similarly, lower emissions in China stem mostly from lingering economic issues in the wake of COVID-19 and a debt crisis in the construction sector, but they also reflect a promising bump in the use of solar and wind power.

Beyond fossil fuels, which make up about 90% of total CO2 emissions, the report highlights other key contributors. ""The remaining 10% from land use, such as deforestation, also matters a great deal,"" Korsbakken told Live Science in an email.

Just three countries — Indonesia, Brazil and the Democratic Republic of the Congo — contribute 58% of the world's ""land use emissions,"" a catchall phrase that describes, among other things, the impacts of deforestation, forest fires, agricultural burning and emissions from livestock. Of particular concern is the increased conversion of carbon-dense forests into rice paddy fields and soybean farms by people in poorer regions. ""It is important that richer nations help these countries to develop in ways that do not put their still vast forests and rich ecosystems in further peril,"" Korsbakken said.

Long-standing carbon sinks — oceans and forests that collectively absorb about half of our fossil fuel emissions — are also strained to the limit. The report suggests that even these last lines of defense may soon be breached. "" Warming temperatures and changing weather patterns can weaken this CO2 absorption,"" Korsbakken said. ""We estimate that the climate change in the past decade made the absorption about 10% lower than what it otherwise would have been. This is yet another risk that we are exposing ourselves to by not cutting emissions rapidly.""

While the report gives scant cause for optimism, the authors admitted that it's hard to say if 2022 was worse than expected, or how the year might have panned out had we not been simultaneously recovering from a pandemic and living through a war that has placed unusual strain on the European Union. Perhaps climate policies are working, to a degree, but are unable to counterbalance such international upheaval.

""The noise from the pandemic, the energy shortages and supply-chain issues from the recovery, and the chaos wrought by Russia's invasion of Ukraine mean that it is very hard to discern any effect that climate policies might have had,"" Korsbakken said.

Either way, the authors agree that stronger climate policies are necessary — ideally ones that replace fossil fuels with renewable energy without crippling the global economy. Such goals demand a nuanced approach.

""Energy use and emissions are driven by a myriad of factors in different sectors, each of which play different roles in the global economy and in people's lives, and all of which have various interest groups attached to them,"" Korsbakken said. ""Add politics, and it's not hard to understand why cutting emissions has been so hard."""

Preliminary data for 2022 shows a slight increase – about 1 per cent – in carbon emissions from fossil fuels relative to 2021, according to the Global Carbon Project, a network of dozens of researchers from around the world that has tracked carbon emissions for 16 years.

This projected growth brings global fossil CO2 emissions for 2022 slightly above the 2019 pre-pandemic levels.

This increase was primarily driven by the growth in oil consumption from the return of aviation following the COVID-19 lockdowns. If the current emission levels persist, there is a 50 per cent chance global warming of 1.5 degrees will be exceeded in nine years."

“The Priority Actions” aims at “decarbonize power, transport and steel, scale up low-emission hydrogen production and accelerate the shift to sustainable agriculture by COP28,” the statement said.

Countries committed to implementing these actions included the G7, European Commission, India, Egypt, Morocco and others, the statement continued.

The Priority Actions include agreements to:

• Develop common definitions for low-emission and near-zero emission steel, hydrogen and sustainable batteries to help direct billions of pounds in investment, procurement and trade to ensure credibility and transparency.

• Ramp up the deployment of essential infrastructure projects including at least 50 large scale net-zero emission industrial plants, at least 100 hydrogen valleys and a package of major cross-border power grid infrastructure projects.

• Set a common target date to phase out polluting cars and vehicles, consistent with the Paris Agreement. Significant backing for the dates of 2040 globally and 2035 in leading markets will be announced by countries, businesses and cities on Solutions Day

• Use billions of pounds of private and public procurement and infrastructure spend to stimulate global demand for green industrial goods.

• Systematically strengthen financial and technological assistance to developing countries and emerging markets to support their transitions backed up by a range of new financial measures, including the world’s first major dedicated industry transition programme under the Climate Investment Funds.

• Drive investment in agriculture research, development & demonstration (RD&D) to generate solutions to address the challenges of food insecurity, climate change and environmental degradation.

Today’s thematic day is tackling fast ways towards decarbonization in several industries like fertilizers, oil, and gas. Also, a panel was allocated to advance efforts in Decarbonization"
61c1c66d-7288-485a-a156-cec5e553fc5a,"The US government’s newly passed Inflation Reduction Act will direct $370 billion toward advancing renewal energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions—the country's largest investment in fighting climate change so far.

As business and government leaders around the world gathered in Egypt this week for COP27, the 27th annual United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, Working Knowledge asked faculty members affiliated with the Business & Environment Initiative: What should business leaders do to seize this historic moment?

Here’s what they said:

Rebecca Henderson: Set reduction targets and keep pushing forward

“Set an emissions reduction target. And if they have already done that, set milestones on the road to that target. And if they have already done that, make sure that the company is clearly on track to meet these milestones. And if they have already done that, explore what can be done within their industry to reduce emissions together.”

Rebecca Henderson (@RebeccaReCap) is the John and Natty McArthur University Professor and author of Reimagining Capitalism in a World on Fire.

John Macomber: Evaluate investments based on long-term benefits and risks

“Business leaders should press to ensure that the $369 billion allocated to energy security and climate change investments is truly allocated to investments. That means expenditures with a long-term benefit toward a specific return objective and not toward speculative technologies or to one-time, zero-ROI grants for past flood or fire damage.

For instance, upgrading transmission lines for electricity and pipelines for the fossil fuels that consumers still demand accomplishes energy efficiency, increases energy security, reduces risk of fire and spills, and pays back for decades.

More specific to climate change mitigation, business leaders could propose that some Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) funds go into low-interest, junior loans. They could go toward otherwise financially borderline energy efficiency (and carbon reduction) projects in transportation, power generation, and home heating that would then attract supplemental private capital so together, deals are completed that otherwise would not be done.

It appears that there will be increasing peril from wildfire, river flooding, drought, and extreme heat. Business leaders can model capital investment that reduces risk from those perils in their own real property and infrastructure portfolios—so that federal, state, and local governments can then use some of the IRA money to fund interventions that are shown to work. To illustrate, these last investments might turn out to be fireproofing, house elevating, water reuse, or white roofs and cooling centers respectively.”

Rosabeth Moss Kanter: Get involved at the city level

“Metropolitan regions are increasingly at the forefront of climate action. They house a large proportion of the population, face costly threats from climate-related disasters, and consume 78 percent of the world’s energy and emit 60 percent of the world’s greenhouse gases, according to UN estimates. Yet, in my studies of climate action in US cities, business leaders are largely missing from the pledging, planning, and execution of local and regional climate goals.

Most cities can point to some business actions: parking lot EV charging stations or shared bicycles, rooftop gardens or ground level trees, wind power turbines, flood-proofing, and the like. But they tend to be isolated one-off examples with limited impact. If enlightened leaders join forces, their collaborations can stimulate innovations, create new markets, or push government to accelerate infrastructure projects, some of which already have funds allocated.

Coalitions with business leadership are vital to encourage the most innovative and help the most vulnerable. Climate tech startups need support from established companies—for testing sites, referrals, and partnerships—to enrich the ecosystem and enable more solutions to grow, whether energy efficient technologies or inventions that directly capture and store carbon.

At the same time, coalitions should include advocates for climate justice to ensure that areas most vulnerable to climate disasters, where residents tend to be Black and Latinx and have low incomes, can access affordable renewable energy, building upgrades, and electric buses. This can also help businesses meet diversity, equity, and inclusion goals by enlarging employment pools.

Business leaders must think outside their own buildings to the communities that make their success possible. To get the most impact from climate investments requires not just concrete infrastructure but an infrastructure for collaboration.”

Rosabeth Moss Kanter (@RosabethKanter) is the Ernest L. Arbuckle Professor of Business Administration. Her latest book is Think Outside the Building: How Advanced Leaders Can Change the World One Smart Innovation at a Time.

Peter Tufano: Turn pledges into reality

“COP27 has been called ‘The Implementation COP,’ which seems particularly apt for a business community that prides itself on action. Given our rapidly depleted global carbon budget, this is indeed a decisive year in a decisive decade.

Globally, we need to develop new technologies to slow and reverse greenhouse gas emissions. Fortunately, in the US, the IRA provides substantial incentives and de facto industrial policy to do so. We have to turn our net-zero pledges into reality. While many companies have made pledges in good faith, implementation plans are still mostly poorly formed.

Recent Edelman research suggests while the public thinks that business can have a big impact on climate, 64 percent of people in 14 countries think that business is 'mediocre or worse' at keeping our climate promises, with coal, private equity, fashion, fast food, and oil and gas judged least likely 'to do what is right in addressing climate change.' We will build trust if we turn our words into deeds.

Finally, my own work looks at climate alliances; increasingly we must find new ways of collaborating. Our rival is not our competitor, our enemy is not the government—our common foes are the forces we have unleashed that threaten the future of the planet.”

ae8bb427-c372-4851-9d9e-a6757d195e92,"The Clorox Company and Heineken Company Join Consortium to Drive Meaningful Climate Action and Energy Transformation

WASHINGTON, Nov. 11, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The urgency in accelerating climate action is top of mind as world leaders gather in Egypt this week for COP 27, the 27th annual UN meeting on climate. Iconic companies Atlantic Packaging, The Clorox Company, The Coca-Cola Company, The Estée Lauder Companies, General Mills, The Heineken Company, Keurig Dr Pepper, Mars, Incorporated, McCormick & Company, Mondelēz International, Nestlé North America, PepsiCo, Restaurant Brands International, and Yum! are spearheading the way forward on a unique collaborative consortium effort to inform innovative approaches for the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across the supply chain.

In April 2021, Guidehouse, a leading global provider of consulting and managed services to public sector and commercial clients, partnered with founding members Mars, McCormick & Company, and PepsiCo for the formation of the Supplier Leadership on Climate Transition (Supplier LoCT) consortium, a collective action platform that standardizes climate action and provides suppliers with resources, tools, and knowledge to support their own climate journeys. As the consortium continues to evolve with the addition of new members including The Clorox Companies and The Heineken Company, they also challenge and invite all approved signatories to the Science Based Target initiative to join and work collaboratively to impact this complex issue that crosses communities, industries, geographies and traditional boundaries.

""We are working collaboratively with our value chain partners to make a meaningful impact and take urgent action to set science-based targets,"" said Sonia Thimmiah, Senior Director Global Sustainability at The Heineken Company. ""Together with Supplier LoCT, The Heineken Company is giving our suppliers the tools to understand their emissions, develop and report targets as well as creating a community of passionate leaders across our value chain that will amplify the positive impact, we can have to urgently address climate change.""

""It's never been more vital for companies to engage their supply chains to help advance climate action,"" said Eva Choe, Chief Procurement Officer at The Clorox Company. ""As part of Clorox's commitment to a cleaner world, it's critical to leverage the collective power of the industry to support suppliers' capabilities necessary for achieving our ambitious scope 3 science-based targets.""

Members of Supplier LoCT sponsor the participation of their suppliers in a six-month series of instruction developing a GHG footprint, setting a science-based target, adopting GHG abatement measures, and disclosing progress. Guidehouse subject matter experts provide supplier participants with direct mentoring and actionable steps on how to build internal capacity. As suppliers move through their sustainability journey, they earn recognition for their accomplishments.

""Science-based targets are our top sustainability priority, and Supplier LoCT is helping us to get there,"" said Nicolas Lootens, Group Sustainability Manager at Vetropack, a supplier participant in Supplier LoCT.

COP27 brings government, corporate, and NGO leaders together to accelerate action toward the goals of the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Supplier LoCT members attending the event plan to share information about how supporting their suppliers on their sustainability journey helps them meet their own science-based target initiatives and invite other companies to join the consortium.

Supplier LoCT is truly global, with 55 countries represented by the companies and their suppliers. With over 500 suppliers in Supplier LoCT across 14 companies, this program guides suppliers on their climate journeys, from scope 1-2 and footprinting to abatement. As a result of the program, 60% of suppliers in Supplier LoCT have developed scope 1 and 2 footprints and 55% of suppliers have developed a scope 3 footprint. The Supplier LoCT approach has been widely recognized as a practical and scalable approach to addressing the universal challenge faced by companies in addressing scope 3 emissions.

""We are at a pivotal moment,"" said Jan-Willem Bode, Partner and Sustainability Lead at Guidehouse. ""Companies that have set science-based targets must move beyond pledging to action, and that requires developing a meaningful plan to address scope 3 emissions and for suppliers to address footprinting, target-setting, abatement, disclosure, green finance, and change management faster than the first wave did over the last decade. Reaching net-zero requires sustained supplier engagement in order to contribute to GHG reductions, leading to more resilient supply chains as well. This allows for companies to stay on track with the Paris Agreement. Without these step-change approaches, 2030 and 2050 targets are certainly out of reach.""

Barry Parkin, Vice President of Sustainability & Procurement for Mars, said: ""The best way we can slow climate change is with a unified approach from our industry, and it's never been more important to motivate, educate and measure the actions of our suppliers on the front lines of this effort. Mars is very pleased to see Supplier LoCT membership continue to grow, and we look forward to making real progress together.""

Laura Draucker, Director of Corporate Greenhouse Gas Emissions at Ceres, a global nonprofit focused on sustainable economic growth, noted that investors are united in their call for disclosure and action on corporate scope 3 emissions and the climate risks they represent. ""Companies that are setting targets and acting on scope 3 through programs like Supplier LoCT are addressing those climate risks head on. All companies that want to thrive in a low emissions future should join them.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Countries representing more than half of the global economy on Friday specified the steps they will take to help accelerate the low-carbon transition by cutting emissions in sectors including power, transport and steel.

Announced at the COP27 climate talks in the coastal Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, the United States, Germany, Japan and Canada were among those to back a set of 25 ""Priority Actions"" that they aim to unveil by next year's talks in Dubai.

They hope that by collectively agreeing on a set of steps, for example agreeing a date to phase out gasoline-driven vehicles, they can send a clear signal to the market of policy direction that will encourage investors and companies to act.

Originally established as the ""Breakthrough Agenda"" at the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow, the Priority Actions also cover hydrogen and agriculture, with buildings and cement due to be added in 2023.

Coalitions of companies will join together for each sector, led by a core group and reinforced by finance and industry groups also working on the same problems.

""Radical collaboration is required to limit global warming to 1.5°C.,"" said Nigel Topping, U.N. Climate Change High-Level Champion for the UK, referring to the world's climate goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by mid-century.

""The Breakthrough Agenda is the largest ever collaborative effort to drive down the cost of cutting emissions across power, transport, steel, hydrogen and agriculture, in line with the 1.5°C trajectory.""

Thirteen countries had signed up to acclerate action in agriculture, led by Britain and Egypt, for example by increasing investment to generate solutions to mitigate climate change and adapt to its impacts.

""This represents a concrete international plan to decarbonise high-emitting sectors by 2030 and help developing countries seize the opportunity of low-carbon and climate resilient growth and development,"" said Mahmoud Mohieldin, UN Climate Change High-Level Champion for Egypt.

9af3da57-7343-4114-a678-0e0f722d11d6,"UN Climate Change Meeting ‘Looks Like a Fossil Fuel Industry Trade Show,’ Activists Say

Tens of thousands of people are gathering in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt for the annual UN climate change conference this month — and that includes hundreds of representatives from the fossil fuel industry who are sitting in on the talks and outnumbering representatives from some of the world’s most vulnerable countries, a new analysis has found.

At last year’s UN climate meeting, known as the Conference of Parties (COP), organisers of the conference in Glasgow made a grand show of declaring fossil fuels unwelcome at the talks, banning corporate sponsorship from oil companies ahead of the conference. However, fossil fuel interests still found a way to piggyback into the discussion. Last year, more than 500 delegates in Glasgow had some sort of ties to the fossil fuel industry, a group of campaign groups found.

One would think that after getting called out, the industry would have enough self-respect to behave a little better this year — but that’s giving polluters too much credit. Figures provided to the BBC this week found there are more than 600 representatives of polluters attending the COP27 conference in Egypt — a 25% increase over last year. The research was given to the BBC by the same coalition that did last year’s analysis, including Global Witness, Corporate Accountability, and the Corporate Europe Observatory

“COP27 looks like a fossil fuel industry trade show,” Rachel Rose Jackson, from Corporate Accountability, told the BBC. “We’re on a carousel of madness here rather than climate action. The fossil fuel industry, their agenda, it’s deadly. Their motivation is profit and greed. They’re not serious about climate action. They never have been and they never will.”

About 200 fossil fuel representatives are tagging along to COP as part of a country delegation, the analysis found. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the United Arab Emirates alone was responsible for bringing 70 of those delegates. (The overall UAE delegation was more than 1,000 this year, up substantially from just 170 in Glasgow; the UAE will host next year’s COP). Coming in second was Russia, which brought 33 fossil fuel delegates. The 436 representatives not with specific country delegations, the analysis found, are attending with trade groups or other non-governmental organisations.

In all, the research found, the number of fossil-fuel-aligned representatives in Egypt this year outnumbered the total number of delegates sent by ten of the countries most impacted by climate change combined, including Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Mozambique.

When they’re at these talks, industry representatives are not just sitting quietly by — they’re making their presence known. And the influence of industry can be felt in some of the outcomes of the talks. Last year, the final text of the Glasgow Agreement contained several loopholes that many advocates and climate-impacted countries complained left room for the fossil fuel industry to survive and flourish as the world tries to move off its product.

Some have argued that having a seat at the table for the industry during these talks can allow them to become allies in the global energy transition. But many from developing countries that are most affected by climate change say that time and goodwill has run out.

“If you want to address malaria, you don’t invite the mosquitoes,” Phillip Jakpor, who works with Public Participation Africa, told the BBC. “As long as we have the fossil fuel lobby and machinery in full swing, we will not make progress and we have not made progress.”"

News

Duration 2:04

The worldwide demand for gas, and its potential to derail emission targets, is top of mind for many at the COP27 climate summit as a slew of important American politicians descended on the conference Wednesday."
51fe8ff4-2ccf-4a23-91a3-803dce0197f5,"“Their motivation is profit and greed. They’re not serious about climate action. They never have been and they never will.”

Yet there they were. At a conference seemingly set on wiping them off the map, the oil and gas majors were keen to make their mark.

They spoke on panels. They advocated for carbon capture and storage. They talked about energy security and affordability. They championed gas for developing countries.

“We can’t go from the old to the new when the new isn’t built. It’s a recipe for disaster. It’s a recipe for an energy crisis. It’s a recipe for a cost-of-living crisis,” BP chief executive Bernard Looney told a Sustainable Markets Initiative forum.

“We must build the new and invest responsibly in the old, and have an orderly transition.”

Intensifying struggle

Advertisement

The headline cleavage at COP27 is supposedly the one between rich countries and poorer ones, as they wrangle endlessly over how much climate finance and support will flow from north to south, when, for what purpose, and in what form. But that fight has been going on for years.

There is another struggle that is intensifying this year, and which will surely come to a head when the UAE, a gas superpower, hosts the next COP in Dubai in a year’s time.

It is between seething and urgent climate activists, who want to purge all fossil fuel forthwith, versus those who tout gas as an indispensable smoother of the energy transition.

It’s a fight between purity and pragmatism, between stringency and flexibility. At stake is how much we pay for energy in the short term; and also how and how quickly the world reallocates its capital and energy profile towards renewables.

While hostility between climate activists and the carbon industries is far from new, events this year have reshaped the battlefield.

The Glasgow COP seemed to have successfully turned coal into a pariah commodity and put gas on notice. But then Russia invaded Ukraine, and switched off the pipelines to Europe. Europe’s green dreams were put on hold in a dash for LNG. This drove up prices and has, according to Climate Action Tracker, spurred a wave of gas projects that could lock the world into using the fossil fuel for decades.

Even this year, CO2 emissions from fossil fuels will hit record levels, according to the Global Carbon Project, rising 1 per cent to 36.6 billion tonnes. The deluge of stats and forecasts released during COP27 mostly suggest it is almost – or even already – too late to prevent global average temperatures rising more than the agreed catastrophe threshold of 1.5 degrees.

Alarming trajectory

This ticking clock has left climate activists increasingly frustrated at calls for a staged and staggered transition. They say time is too short to keep dallying with gas.

“The trajectory we’re on is alarming. We appear to be on track for 2.1 degrees to 2.6 degrees – which is not compatible with well-functioning human societies,” says Simon Bradshaw, of the Climate Council.

Some activists have called for the “criminal” representatives of fossil fuel interests to be ejected from the summit. All want the 190-plus countries at COP27 to make stronger commitments to phasing out fossil fuels, ratcheting up the often nebulous or incomplete commitments agreed last year.

The UN, which oversees the COP process, has weighed in. An experts’ report commissioned by the Secretary-General this week said any company whose energy transition plan included any oil or gas exploration, expansion or indefinite production, could not be deemed net zero compliant.

But next year’s COP host, the UAE, has taken out a massive pavilion where its endorsement of gas sits plainly beside its renewables plans. Global Witness says 70 members of the UAE’s official delegation are linked to the promotion of fossil fuels.

“The UAE is known as a responsible supplier of energy, and will continue to play this role for as long as the world needs oil and gas. We will focus on lowering carbon emissions emanating from this sector,” President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan told the opening plenary.

BP’s Looney called a spade a spade. “We do need some investment in today’s energy system which, whether we like it or not, is a hydrocarbon system. So, our strategy is simply to do both: we will decline our hydrocarbon business over time, but we continue to invest in it today.”

BP chief Bernard Looney: “This is not a black and white world, where if you’re green you’re good and if you’re not green, you’re bad.” Bloomberg

By 2025, he said, more than 40 per cent of BP’s investments would not be in oil or gas. But he acknowledged that “by definition, that means that over 50 per cent of our capital will still be in hydrocarbons in three years’ time. It is a transition.”

Looney said that investors looking to make the biggest impact on climate change should put their money into carbon-intensive companies that had net zero plans.

“This is not a black and white world, where if you’re green you’re good and if you’re not green, you’re bad. There is a big thing in the middle called greening companies. It’s where the emissions are. It’s where we need to go,” he said.

“It’s steel, it’s cement, it’s aviation, it’s oil and gas. And we need to back, encourage, challenge, hold to account companies like ours to decarbonise – and that’s what we’re trying to do.”

‘Fossil fuel apologist’

Climate activists don’t buy it, but they worry that others are.

The Australia Institute’s Richie Merzian says he’s hearing the industry’s talking points coming out of the mouths of emerging market politicians and officials. “You can see it in the language, it’s fossil fuel apologist,” he says.

Bill Hare, an Australian scientist who worked on the Climate Action Tracker’s assessment of future global gas production, says the energy crisis has spurred the industry into action. “What I saw this year is very strong engagement, lobbying by the gas industry of governments in Africa, and also in Europe,” he says.

Africa’s attitude to developing and consuming oil and gas has been a talking point of the summit. The continent has suffered fallout from Europe’s crisis, and wants to increase its energy security and independence.

Seemingly the best way for COP’s rich countries to divert Africa from the gas path would be to offer more funding for decarbonisation and renewable energy. Which loops the gas fight back into the bitter and intractable north-south clash over money.

Various moves are afoot to get the private sector involved, but the level of risk and upfront investment means Western governments and the World Bank may need to act as a backstop or seed funder.

David Dyer, a partner at McKinsey & Company, who leads the consultancy’s sustainability practice in Australia, says the scale and pace of change required makes capital allocation hugely challenging.

“We need to be open-minded about what that pathway to decarbonisation is,” he says.

“It would not be surprising to see conversations around carbon capture and storage come back onto the radar. With the sheer size of the challenge, you do want to put every possible option on the table.”

The climate activists, though, want fossil fuels taken off the table and thrown into the bin. It’s unlikely that the coming week of tortuous COP27 negotiations on texts and pledges will, in any way, resolve or progress the argument.

After the COP cavalcade moves on from Sharm el-Sheikh, the fight over gas will move back to company AGMs and boardrooms, to street protests and panel discussions. It will haunt the corridors of the European Commission, and it will wag tongues at Davos in January.

And in a year’s time, the fight will move to Dubai – where it might blaze fully into the open."

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt (AP) — The Latest on the United Nations climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt.

The youngest sister of a jailed Egyptian pro-democracy activist says she is “scared” for her brother after prison authorities told the family they medically intervened after his days-long hunger and water strike and has appealed to U.S. President Joe Biden for help.

Sanaa Seif, the sister of Alaa Abdel-Fattah, said Thursday that she is concerned her brother’s health could have deteriorated and that authorities might have resorted to force-feeding him to keep him alive.

“I’m really scared,” she said. “I don’t know for sure (what happened), but I’m imagining that Alaa is handcuffed somewhere. He’s put on IVs against his will.”

Seif, the youngest of three siblings of late rights lawyer Ahmed Seif, spoke with The Associated Press in the seaside resort of Sharm el-Sheikh where she has been campaigning for her brother’s release at the U.N. climate conference.

She called on Biden, who is scheduled to meet with President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi on Friday in Sharm el-Sheikh, to intervene in her brother’s case.

“I appeal to President Biden, and I hope that he makes an intervention, that he talks, he finds a way. We need help. I still have some hope.”

She called for the Egyptian government to “please find a solution.""

Amnesty International’s Secretary General Agnès Callamard urged Egyptian authorities to allow an “independent” medical assessment for pro-democracy activist Alaa Abdel-Fattah, who is on a hunger and water strike in an Egyptian prison.

Prison authorities have told Abdel-Fattah’s family that they have intervened medically with the activist.

“We are very alarmed. Why? Because the prison system in Egypt is abysmal in its treatment, medical treatment of prisoners,” said Callamard. “He should have access to independent medical doctor.”

Speaking to The Associated Press at the U.N. climate conference in Egypt’s Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, the rights defender called for Egyptian authorities to transfer Abdel-Fattah to a medical facility, chosen by his family.

She also demanded that authorities allow his family to visit him and release him “as soon as his medical condition allows.”

The nature of the medical intervention was not known, and it was not clear if he was moved to a prison hospital. His lawyer, Khaled Ali, said officials at the prison refused to allow a lawyer for the family to visit him, despite approval by the prosecutors’ office for the visit.

Ali said Interior Ministry officials told him the approval was not valid because it was dated Wednesday, adding in a tweet that he was only notified of the approval on Thursday morning.

The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross called on world leaders and negotiators at the U.N. climate conference to pay greater attention and mobilize funds for conflict-stricken nations that are among the most vulnerable to climate change.

ICRC’s Director-General, Robert Mardini, told The Associated Press Thursday that people in countries like Yemen, Somalia and the Horn of Africa where conflicts have been raging for years are facing “double challenge, double adversity, double risks.”

“We are here to shine a spotlight on the very acute situation for people affected by armed conflict and extreme weather events,” he said. “And also, to make the case that climate action and climate finance should go to those communities.”

He said that “close to zero” climate finance is reaching conflict-impacted areas.

The Russian war in Ukraine also doubled the challenges and costs of living for people in Yemen, Somalia and other conflict-hit nations, who are also extremely vulnerable to climate change shocks, he said.

“There is a knock-on effect of the Ukraine international armed conflict,” he said, pointing to the skyrocketing prices of food, energy, fertilizers, and the straining supply chain.

“So doing the same thing in a place like Somalia or Mali is more costly for us, and we need to mobilize more funds from our donors to do the same type of project that we used to do a year ago,” he said.

U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said China needs to work with the U.S. on climate talks, despite the two countries’ differences.

“They know for the good of their own people that they’ve got to reduce the smog and increase their participation. And if they don’t want to do something any excuse will do,” Pelosi told reporters after speaking at a side event at the U.N. climate talks, known as COP27.

“But I do believe that we should be working with the Chinese,” she added. “I take second place to no one in concern about the human rights violations, their trade violations, their proliferation of weapons of mass destruction over time. But I do believe that we must work with them on climate.”

Russia’s war in Ukraine, which has crimped natural gas supplies to Europe and sped the push to expand gas sources from elsewhere, shouldn’t overshadow the transition to renewable energy, Pelosi said.

“I do think that what I’ve heard from all the countries in the EU and NATO and all the rest is about diversification,” Pelosi said. “We cannot have Putin’s invasion of Ukraine be an excuse to abandon our good policy in terms of saving the planet.”

Pelosi also said developing countries struggling to transition to green energy can use new technology to “leapfrog over mistakes made by all of us in our development in order to get to the desired place much faster.”

Environmental groups are complaining of an increase in the number of fossil fuel lobbyists who are registered for this year’s U.N. climate talks in Egypt.

Global Witness, Corporate Accountability and Corporate Europe Observatory said Thursday that they have counted 636 people linked to fossil fuel companies on the meeting’s provisional list of participants.

This is an increase of more than 25% compared to the 503 fossil fuel lobbyists counted at last year’s climate talks in Glasgow, they said.

Some of the 636 participants identified as being affiliated with fossil fuel companies are registered as members of 29 national delegations such as the United Arab Emirates and Russia, they said.

“Tobacco lobbyists wouldn’t be welcome at health conferences, arms dealers can’t promote their trade at peace conventions,” the groups said. “Those perpetuating the world’s fossil fuel addiction should not be allowed through the doors of a climate conference.”

Millions of people in Ethiopia facing the region’s worst drought in decades after two years of failed rains told the visiting president of the International Rescue Committee this week their livelihoods have been devastated.

“Our livestock have died, our farming land has dried, we have no access to water,” said Mohamed Adem, one of many people displaced across the region. “We came with nothing,” said another displaced person, Rumia Demimussa.

The IRC president, David Miliband, said his message for the U.N. climate conference is that a “truly African COP” must address the needs of the people he’s meeting.

The Horn of Africa faces both a climate crisis and a hunger crisis, he said. Somalia and Kenya also are affected.

A group of climate activists gathered at the U.N. climate summit’s main venue to protest against fuel fossil companies and other polluters.

The activists chanted slogans like, “kick polluters out, let people in” and sang and danced at the venue’s entrance.

Speakers at the protests blamed big polluters for destructive weather events, like flooding drought and rising see levels.

“We stand here today to think of our people, to think of our planet,” one of the speakers said. “We have to reclaim our rights now.”

Cansin Leylim, an activist from the 350.org climate group, criticized soft drink giant Coca Cola’s sponsorship of the event as it is a major contributor to plastic pollution.

“The fact that Coca Cola is sponsoring the climate talks is, frankly, a joke,” she said, adding that fossil fuel lobbyists at the summit have surpassed “the combined delegations of the small island states, the developing countries.”

Protests at COP27 are rare and small and all have taken place inside the venue’s Blue Zone, which is considered a U.N. territory.

A few dozen activists held a silent protest early Thursday at the U.N. climate conference venue to highlight human rights violations globally, particularly in Egypt, the host country.

The protesters held signs that read, “No climate justice without human rights.”

Most of them wore white T-shirts and had their hands tied or a piece of cloth in their mouths, to highlight the plight of jailed activists especially in Egypt where many pro-democracy activists have been behind bars for years.

“We’re in solidarity with Egyptian prisoners of conscience right now,” said Dipiti Bhatnagar, an activist with the Friends of the Earth International, a network of environmental organizations. “All human rights of everyone must be respected in order to achieve the dream of climate justice.”

Another environmental activist from Tanzania, Shamim Navil Nyanda, said human rights should be prioritized at the climate talks.

“We need to put human rights first. We need to look after humanity, and together we can protect the planet,” she said.

Seven Asian countries have saved approximately $34 billion this year by using solar energy instead of fossil fuels, a report by three Asia-based climate think tanks said Thursday. The report comes as officials discuss how to drastically slash emissions at the U.N. climate talks in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt.

The report found that the majority of the estimated savings are in China, where solar met 5% of the total electricity demand and avoided approximately $21 billion in additional coal and gas imports in the first half of this year.

Japan saw the second-highest impact, with $5.6 billion in avoided fuel costs thanks to solar power generation alone. In India, solar power saved $4.2 billion in fuel costs in the first half of the year.

“Asian countries need to tap into their massive solar potential to rapidly transition away from costly and highly-polluting fossil fuels,” said Isabella Suarez, one of the report’s authors and energy analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. “While ambitious targets are important, follow through will be the key thing to watch moving forward.”

A report released Thursday says deforestation in the expansive Congo Basin rainforest increased by 5% in 2021.

The Forest Declaration Assessment said only two of the six Congo Basin countries who signed a 2021 commitment on halting and reversing deforestation by 2030 — Congo and Gabon — are on track with the goal. The report comes as officials and negotiators meet in the seaside resort of Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt for U.N. climate talks.

“The Congo Basin Forest is at a crossroads,” said Marion Ferrat, senior the lead author of the report. “Deforestation has been low compared to other tropical regions, but we are seeing an upward trend.”

“If this trend continues, we risk losing the largest remaining intact forest in the tropics along with its immense and irreplaceable value for biodiversity, climate, and people.”

It’s estimated that $100 billion is needed to preserve the Amazon Basin each year, said Lawrence Nsoyuni of the Geospatial Technology Group, who urged greater financial pledges.

“If world leaders are serious about their commitments to stop forest loss, they must step up financial support for the Congo Basin,” he said.

493dd336-87a7-49fd-acce-b4af2879e2e7,"Russia’s war on Ukraine has cast a shadow over this week’s meetings of world leaders at the G-20 summit in Bali and the United Nations climate change conference in Egypt.

The war has dramatically disrupted energy markets the world over, leaving many countries vulnerable to price spikes amid supply shortages.

Europe, worried about keeping the heat on through winter, is outbidding poor countries for natural gas, even paying premiums to reroute tanker ships after Russia cut off most of its usual natural gas supply. Some countries are restarting coal-fired power plants. Others are looking for ways to expand fossil fuel production, including new projects in Africa.

These actions are a long way from the countries’ pledges just a year ago to rein in fossil fuels, and they’re likely to further increase greenhouse gas emissions, at least temporarily.

But will the war and the economic turmoil prevent the world from meeting the Paris climate agreement’s long-term goals?

There are reasons to believe that this may not be the case.

The answer depends in part on how wealthy countries respond to a focus of this year’s climate conference: fulfilling their pledges in the Paris Agreement to provide support for low- and middle-income countries to build clean energy systems.

Europe speeds up clean energy plans

A key lesson many countries are taking away from the ongoing energy crisis is that, if anything, the transition to renewable energy must be pushed forward faster.

I work with countries as they update national climate pledges and have been involved in evaluating the compatibility of global emissions reduction scenarios with the Paris Agreement. I see the energy crisis affecting countries’ plans in different ways.

About 80% of the world’s energy is still from fossil sources. Global trade in coal, oil and natural gas has meant that even countries with their own energy supplies have felt some of the pain of exorbitant prices. In the U.S., for example, natural gas and electricity prices are higher than normal because they are increasingly tied to international markets, and the U.S. is the world’s largest exporter of liquefied natural gas.

The shortage has led to a scramble to find fossil fuel suppliers in the short term. European countries have offered to help African countries produce more natural gas and have courted authoritarian regimes. The Biden administration is urging companies to extract more oil and gas, has tried to pressure Saudi Arabia to produce more oil, and considered lifting sanctions against Venezuela.

However, Europe also has a growing renewable energy supply that has helped cushion some of the impact. A quarter of the European Union’s electricity comes from solar and wind, avoiding billions of euros in fossil fuel costs. Globally, investments in the clean energy transition increased by about 16% in 2022, the International Energy Agency estimates.

Developing countries face complex challenges

If Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a wake-up call to accelerate the clean energy transition in wealthier countries, the situation is much more complex in developing countries.

Low-income countries are being hit hard by the impact of Russia’s war, not only by high energy costs, but also by decreases in grain and cooking oil exports. The more these countries are dependent on foreign oil and gas imports for their energy supply, the more they will be exposed to global market gyrations.

Renewable energy can reduce some of that exposure.

The costs of solar and wind energy have dropped dramatically in the past decade and now represent the cheapest sources of energy in most regions. But advances in expanding access to clean electricity have been set back by the war. Borrowing costs can also be a barrier for low-income countries, and those costs will increase as countries raise interest rates to fight inflation.

As part of the Paris Agreement, wealthy countries were supposed to make good on promises to make US$100 billion per year available for climate finance, but the actual amounts provided have fallen short.

To achieve the Paris Agreement targets, coal, oil and natural gas consumption must decrease dramatically in the next decade or two. International cooperation will be necessary to help poorer countries expand energy access and transition to low-emissions development pathways.

Africa’s fossil fuels and stranded asset risks

A number of developing countries have their own fossil fuel resources, and some in Africa have been calling for increasing production, although not without pushback.

Without a strong alternative within local contexts for sustainable energy resources, and with wealthy countries scrambling for fossil fuels, developing countries will exploit fossil resources – just as the wealthiest countries have done for over a century. For example, Tanzania’s energy minister, January Makamba, told Bloomberg during the U.N. climate conference that his country expects to sign agreements with Shell and other oil majors for a $40 billion liquefied natural gas export project.

While this intersection of interests could boost some developing countries, it can also set up future challenges.

Encouraging the construction of new fossil-fuel infrastructure in Africa – presumably to be earmarked for Europe in the short to medium term – may help ameliorate some near-term supply shortages, but how long will those customers need the fuel? And how much of that income will benefit the people of those countries?

The IEA sees natural gas demand plateauing by 2030 and oil and coal demand falling, even without more ambitious climate policies. Any infrastructure built today for short-term supplies risks becoming a stranded asset, worthless in a low-emissions world.

Encouraging developing countries to take on debt risk to invest in fossil fuel extraction for which the world will have no use would potentially do these countries a great disservice, taking advantage of them for short-term gain.

The world has made progress on emissions in recent years, and the worst warming projections from a decade ago seem to be highly unlikely now. But every tenth of a degree has an impact, and the current “business-as-usual” path still leads the planet toward warming levels with climate change costs that are hard to contemplate, especially for the most vulnerable countries. The outcomes from the climate conference and G-20 summit will give an indication of whether the global community is willing to accelerate the transition.

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov 11 (Reuters) - An initiative led by the United States and the United Arab Emirates to help agriculture adapt to climate change and reduce emissions through innovation has doubled investment commitments to $8 billion and extended its reach, it said on Friday.

The Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM for Climate) was launched one year ago and seeks to accelerate innovation in ""climate smart"" agriculture globally up to 2025, as the world races to contain global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius.

At the COP27 climate change talks in Sharm el-Sheikh it announced commitments for $7 billion of investments from 42 governments, and $1 billion in innovation initiatives aimed at small-holder farmers in developing economies, new technologies, agro-ecological research and methane reduction.

Farming is on the frontline of extreme weather but is also a major contributor to global emissions that cause warming.

AIM will help farmers deal with challenges that have become more apparent this year, said U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Thomas Vilsack: productivity losses linked to climate change, and higher input costs resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine.

""I think there's an opportunity here for us - for the United States in particular - but for large scale agriculture, to help inform smallholders about the knowledge and information we're getting about more efficient use, more precise use of fertilizer and other inputs which can lower costs for farmers and also without jeopardizing productivity,"" Vilsack told Reuters in a call.

Agriculture could get to net zero ""a bit faster than maybe some of the other industries that are commonly discussed when we talk about climate,"" he said.

""I think there's just tremendous carbon sequestration capacity, there's tremendous opportunities to reduce methane, there's tremendous opportunities to convert agricultural waste into a variety of products that would significantly reduce the greenhouse gas footprint of agricultural production.""

Vilsack said the UAE, which imports about 80% of its food and will host the COP28 climate talks in 2023, wanted to help shore up production in food exporting countries as well as boosting self-reliance through innovation.

Despite an increase in energy efficiency investment and lower energy intensity, the building and construction sector's energy consumption and CO 2 emissions have rebounded from the COVID-19 pandemic to an all-time high, a new report finds.

Released at the latest round of climate talks in Egypt, COP27, the 2022 Global Status Report for Buildings and Construction finds that the sector accounted for more than 34% of energy demand and about 37% of energy and process-related CO 2 emissions in 2021.

The sector's operational energy-related CO 2 emissions reached ten gigatons of CO 2 equivalent—5% over 2020 levels and 2% over the pre-pandemic peak in 2019. In 2021, operational energy demand for heating, cooling, lighting and equipment in buildings increased by around 4% from 2020 and 3% from 2019.

This, according to the report from the Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction (GlobalABC), means that the gap between the climate performance of the sector and the 2050 decarbonization pathway is widening.

""Years of warnings about the impacts of climate change have become a reality,"" said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP). ""If we do not rapidly cut emissions in line with the Paris Agreement, we will be in deeper trouble.""

""The buildings sector represents 40% of Europe's energy demand, 80% of it from fossil fuels. This makes the sector an area for immediate action, investment, and policies to promote short and long-term energy security""

Decarbonizing the buildings sector by 2050 is critical to delivering these cuts. To reduce overall emissions, the sector must improve building energy performance, decrease building materials' carbon footprint, multiply policy commitments alongside action and increase investment in energy efficiency.

Key global trends

The sector's emissions intensity in kilograms of CO 2 per square meter dropped from 43 in 2015 to 40 in 2021.

Energy intensity in kilowatts per hour per square meter slightly decreased, from 153 in 2015 to 152 in 2021.

Investments in building energy efficiency have gone up by unprecedented levels, rising by 16% in 2021 over 2020 levels to USD 237 billion.

However, growth is outpacing efforts on energy efficiency and reducing energy intensity.

The increase in global gross floor area between 2015 and 2021 is the equivalent to the total land area covered in buildings in Germany, France, Italy and Netherlands; if it were built on one level, at around 24,000 sq. km.

The report says that investments in energy efficiency must be sustained in the face of growing crises—such as the war in Ukraine and the ensuing energy crisis, and the cost-of-living crisis—to reduce energy demand, avoiding CO 2 emissions and dampen energy cost volatility. The buildings sector represents 40% of Europe's energy demand, 80% of it from fossil fuels. This makes the sector an area for immediate action, investment and policies to promote short and long-term energy security.

The report shows that the sector can still change. For example, rising fossil fuel costs due to the war in Ukraine and the cost-of-living crisis are providing incentives to invest in energy efficiency—although the erosion of purchasing power and the impact of labor and materials may slow investment. ""The solution may lie in governments directing relief towards low and zero-carbon building investment activities through financial and non-financial incentives,"" continued Andersen.

Also critical to reducing the sector's emissions are including buildings in climate pledges under the Paris Agreement—known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)—and mandatory building energy codes.

The number of NDCs that mention buildings grew from 88 in 2015 to 158 in 2021. However, progress on buildings and construction policies and action remains slow. Over the same period, the number of countries with building energy codes rose from 62 to 79. However, only 26% of countries have mandatory building energy codes for the entire sector.

A focus on Africa and building materials

The report has special focus sections on building materials, and the region of Africa.

Raw resource use is predicted to double by 2060—with steel, concrete and cement already major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. Materials used in the construction of buildings already account for around nine percent of overall energy-related CO 2 emissions.

Embodied carbon in buildings—the emissions associated with materials and construction processes—needs to be tackled to avoid undermining energy-saving measures. However, the sector can reduce its impact by, for example, looking at alternative materials and decarbonizing conventional materials such as cement.

The use of alternative materials is particularly relevant for Africa.

The African population is expected to reach 2.4 billion people in 2050 and 80% of this growth will occur in cities. An estimated 70% of the African building stock expected for 2040 has yet to be built.

To avoid increasing emissions while building the stock necessary to move people out of informal settlements, and to create buildings that are resilient to the impacts of climate change, the African sector should look at sustainable construction materials and design techniques, in which the continent is rich.

Africa is also rich in renewable energy sources, solar and wind, which nations can use to power their buildings sustainably.

Key recommendations

Build coalitions of national stakeholders to set targets and strategies towards a sustainable, zero-carbon and resilient buildings and construction sector through Buildings Roadmaps. Following the GlobalABC roadmaps process and model, more than 30 countries and territories have been developing roadmaps.

National and sub-national governments must establish mandatory building energy codes and set a pathway for their building codes and standards to achieve net zero as soon as possible.

Governments and non-state actors must increase their investment in energy efficiency.

The construction and real estate industries must implement zero-carbon strategies for new and existing buildings.

The building materials and construction industries must commit to reducing their CO 2 emissions throughout their value chain.

emissions throughout their value chain. Governments, especially cities, need to implement policies that promote the shift to ""circular material economies.""

Fast-growing countries and economies need investment in capacity-building and supply chains that promote energy-efficient designs, low-carbon and sustainable construction.

Xie, also the special representative for Chinese President Xi Jinping, made the remarks in an address to the Climate Implementation Summit at the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP27) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) held in Egypt's coastal city of Sharm El-Sheikh.

Facing the grave challenges posed by the frequent extreme weather events that have caused heavy losses on every continent and by the emergence of energy and food crises this year, multilateralism, solidarity and cooperation remain the only way out of the predicament, Xie said.

Meanwhile, the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and the mechanism of nationally determined contributions are still the ""inevitable choice"" to overcome the climate challenges, he said.

As the UNFCCC marks its 30th anniversary this year and the Paris Agreement has entered the stage of full implementation, the COP27 shoulders the important mission of upholding the consensus on the UNFCCC principles and promoting pragmatic actions by all parties, the Chinese envoy said.

Noting that China has been actively tackling climate change with persistent and pragmatic actions, Xie said that, with the recent successful conclusion of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), China's determination to follow the path of green development was further strengthened.

""China's firm determination and position to implement the goals of reaching carbon peak and achieving carbon neutralization, and to actively participate in global climate governance will never change,"" Xie vowed.

He expressed the hope that the COP27 will focus on the implementation of promises, while urging the developed countries to take the lead in exerting more effective efforts to reduce emissions so to achieve carbon neutralization significantly ahead of schedule, and achieve substantive results on the adaptation and finance issues.

China hopes that ""the developed countries will fulfill their pledge of providing 100 billion U.S. dollars as soon as possible and draw a road map for doubling adaptation finance to enhance mutual trust and joint action between the North and the South,"" Xie said.

""We are willing to work with all parties to adhere to multilateralism, build a fair and reasonable global climate governance system with win-win cooperation, and make greater contribution to tackling the challenges posed by global climate change,"" he added. ■"

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov. 10 (Xinhua) -- Actively adapting to climate change is a ""realistic and urgent"" task, said the head of the Chinese delegation to the UN climate conference on Thursday.

Zhao Yingmin, also vice minister of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, made the remarks at a side event themed ""China's Strategies and Actions on Climate Adaptation"" held at the 27th session of the Conference of Parties (COP27) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in the Egyptian coastal city of Sharm El-Sheikh.

The minister said that mitigation and adaptation are the two major solutions to dealing with climate change, which should be given equal attention and neither of them should be neglected.

Since global climate change has already taken place, effective adaptation actions can reduce its adverse effects and the risks faced by countries and regions so to protect socio-economic development as well as ecological and environmental security, Zhao said.

In addition to promoting domestic adaptation, China is also actively carrying out South-South cooperation with developing countries on adapting to climate change, he said.

""China has provided equipment to developing countries such as micro-satellites, meteorological mobile stations, and drones to support them in improving their ability in terms of natural disasters monitoring and early warning, as well as climate adaptation,"" Zhao noted.

He urged the developed countries to fulfill their promise of providing 100 billion U.S. dollars to the developing countries in climate finance per year, and draw a road map for doubling the adaptation fund.

On the issue of loss and damage caused by climate change, Zhao said that it is a major concern for developing countries. ""China will also make positive efforts and contributions to promoting the progress of the negotiations on loss and damage,"" he said.

Co-hosted by the Chinese Ministry of Ecology and Environment, the Asian Development Bank and the Global Center on Adaptation, the side event also featured discussions on the policies and actions needed to be taken on adaptation to climate change, and sharing of experiences and cases.

""China has maintained sound cooperation with the United Nations and international financial institutions to address climate change, and China is ready to work with the international community to promote the comprehensive, balanced and effective implementation of the Paris Agreement, and continue to contribute China's strength, wisdom and solutions to the building of a fair, equitable and win-win global climate change governance system,"" said the Chinese delegate.

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov. 9 (Xinhua) -- China is willing to work with the international community to promote the comprehensive, balanced and effective implementation of the Paris Agreement, a Chinese delegate said Tuesday.

China has implemented a national strategy to address climate change, a common challenge and crisis faced by mankind, and unswervingly follows the path of ecological priority, green and low-carbon development, said Zhao Yingmin, head of the Chinese delegation to the 27th session of the Conference of Parties (COP27) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

Zhao, also vice minister of China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment, made the remarks at an event about the China Country Climate and Development Report released by the World Bank.

In order to implement the ""dual carbon"" goal, which is to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, China has established a carbon neutralization working mechanism, which has clarified the top-level design of the ""dual carbon"" work, formulated implementation plans in energy, industry, transportation and other key areas, and a carbon neutral ""1+N"" policy system has been established, Zhao said.

From 2012 to 2021, China's annual energy consumption growth rate of 3 percent supported an average economic growth rate of 6.6 percent, carbon dioxide emissions per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) decreased by about 34.4 percent, and energy consumption per unit of GDP decreased by 26.4 percent, with a cumulative saving of 1.4 billion tons of standard coal, he said.

Zhao said China regards the carbon market as an important tool of climate policy and actively promotes the construction of a national carbon emission trading market. On July 16, 2021, the national carbon market officially launched online trading, covering 4.5 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually, making it the world's largest carbon market.

The market has operated in a stable and orderly manner on the whole, and the role of market mechanisms has initially emerged, he added.

As the largest developing country, China makes all-out efforts on climate governance while pursuing economic development. ""China will play a pivotal role in global climate governance,"" said Nicholas Stern, a British economist.

""China has maintained sound cooperation with the United Nations and international financial institutions to address climate change, and China is ready to work with the international community to promote the comprehensive, balanced and effective implementation of the Paris Agreement, and continue to contribute China's strength, wisdom and solutions to the building of a fair, equitable and win-win global climate change governance system,"" Zhao said. ■"

Summary China's methane emissions are world's highest

China emissions mostly from coal mining, agriculture

Biggest challenge is to cut emissions from rice fields















SHANGHAI, Nov 9 (Reuters) - China has drafted a new plan to control methane and will promote new technologies and financing mechanisms to slash rising emissions of the greenhouse gas that traps 80 times more heat than carbon dioxide, the country's top climate official said.

Senior climate change envoy Xie Zhenhua said on the sidelines of climate talks in Egypt's Sharm El-Sheikh on Tuesday the new action plan would lead to concrete measures to curb methane emissions from energy, agriculture and waste.

Tackling methane has become a major part of global efforts to limit temperature rises to 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit), with around 40 countries set to reveal abatement plans in Sharm El-Sheikh.

China's emissions are the highest in the world and around a fifth of the global total. While it did not signed a ""Global Methane Pledge"" last year, it agreed to ""develop additional measures"" to control the gas.

Provincial governments in China have also pledged in recent weeks to take stronger action to curb emissions, and a pilot national programme will begin early next year to discover ""best practices"" to control and monitor the gas.

But Xie said China's ability to control the gas remained ""weak"", and its current focus was on ""preliminary goals"" like improving monitoring capabilities.

Researchers have warned that China's emissions profile could make abatement costlier and more difficult than elsewhere.

Unlike the United States, where oil and gas is the major source, around 40% of China's methane emissions are gas that escapes during the mining of coal, according to the Innovative Green Development Program (IGDP), a Chinese think tank.

Another 42% is from agriculture, including livestock and rice cultivation, the IGDP said in a June research report.

""Many of the methane sources are fugitive emissions, which are usually difficult to accurately account for,"" said Zhang Yuzhong, a researcher at China's Westlake University.

UTILISATION

Climate envoy Xie said a ""change of thinking"" was required to consider greenhouse gases like methane as a potential resource to be utilised.

The utilisation of coalbed methane (CBM) has already become a major industry in China and helped cut atmospheric emissions in northern China's Shanxi province, which produces as much methane from its mines as the rest of the world combined, according to research by Global Energy Monitor.

Methane concentrations vary dramatically, however, meaning there is no one-size-fits-all technological solution, and no guaranteed financial return to justify building storage infrastructure at every mine, experts say.

Utilisation is also not a practical solution for China's abandoned coal mines, now responsible for more man-made methane emissions per year than any single industrialised nation apart from the United States and Russia, according to research from China's Zhejiang University published this month.

Raising utilisation rates could help slash emissions from livestock though, with farmers already encouraged to install digesters to utilise biogas. China's ""comprehensive utilisation"" of agricultural waste could also help slash methane emissions.

A bigger challenge is cutting emissions from rice paddies, which breed methane-emitting bacteria. Any solution would require changes in the practices of millions of farmers, said Westlake University's Zhang.

China's efforts to control methane have so far come up short and it still has a lot to do, said Global Energy Monitor's Ryan Driskell Tate, who has researched China's methane emissions.

""China will need enforcement mechanisms and plans for implementation to achieve its targets,"" he said.

f7a21c47-496d-42a1-9e7b-03120be3b3e2,"China says it is under no obligation to contribute but is still willing to help compensate poorer countries.

China would be willing to contribute to a mechanism for compensating poorer countries for losses and damage caused by climate change, its climate envoy Xie Zhenhua has said.

Speaking at the COP27 environmental conference in Egypt on Wednesday, Xie said China had no obligation to participate but stressed his solidarity with those calling for more action from wealthy nations on the issue, and outlined the damage China had suffered from climate-linked weather extremes.

China is designated by the World Trade Organization as a developing country, despite having the world’s second-largest economy.

Last month, United States special climate envoy John Kerry told reporters that China should contribute its own funds to loss and damage, “especially if they think they’re going to continue to go on to the next 30 years with increasing their emissions,” Politico reported.

Xie noted that Kerry, “his friend for 25 years”, had not raised this issue with him during informal talks at COP27 this week. He added that China already contributed billions of yuan (hundreds of millions of dollars) to developing countries to help with their mitigation efforts.

After US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan this August, China said it would halt all dialogue with the US on climate, despite unveiling a pact with the US at COP26 in Glasgow last year to cooperate on climate change.

Xie said Pelosi’s visit had “hurt Chinese people’s feelings” but noted that informal discussions and personal correspondence with US delegates continued.

“The door is absolutely closed by (the United States),” he said. “It is we, China, who are trying to open it.”"

“Third-world countries seeking compensation for climate damage supposedly done by the West’s economic advance,” Ms Credlin said.

“The ramifications of the federal Labor government’s climate policy are becoming clearer and clearer.

“By all means, let’s reduce emissions, but not at a massive cost to Australian jobs and our cost of living.

“We’ve got to be measured, we’ve got to be steady and we must ensure the playing field, with countries like China, is fair.”"

Leaders from poor countries criticized wealthy governments and oil companies for driving global warming, using their speeches on Tuesday at the COP27 climate summit in Egypt to demand that they pay up for damages being inflicted on their economies.

Small island states already buffeted by increasingly violent ocean storms and sea-level rise called on oil companies to shell out some of their huge recent profits, while developing African states called for more international funds for adaptation.

""The oil and gas industry continues to earn almost 3 billion United States dollars daily in profits,"" said Gaston Browne, Antigua's prime minister, speaking at the conference on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States.

""It is about time that these companies are made to pay a global carbon tax on their profits as a source of funding for loss and damage,"" he said. ""While they are profiting, the planet is burning.""

Nikenike Vurobaravu, the president of the island nation of Vanuatu, said it wanted the International Court of Justice to help ensure future generations' rights were not being violated by nations lagging on climate change.

The comments reflected the tension in international climate negotiations between rich and poor states, as delegates attended the second full day of the two-week U.N. conference in the seaside resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh.

Wealthy western countries tend to be the most vocal advocates of slashing emissions but are also the ones that have contributed the most greenhouse gases after more than a century of fossil fuel-driven industrialization.

Multi-billion-dollar oil industry profits since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February - which has roiled markets and disrupted supplies - have also angered governments worldwide concerned about climate change and rampant consumer inflation.

U.S. President Joe Biden this month said the industry was raking in ""war profits"" and proposed a windfall tax, an idea that has little chance of passing a divided Congress. The United Kingdom has already imposed a windfall profits tax on oil producers, with proceeds meant to defray household energy costs.

But some countries at the conference were more likely to direct their frustration at rich governments, not drillers.

Senegal's President Macky Sall told the conference poor developing countries in Africa needed increased funding from wealthy nations for adaptation to worsening climate change and would resist calls for an immediate shift away from fossil fuels African countries need to expand their economies.

""Let's be clear, we are in favor of reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. But we Africans cannot accept that our vital interests be ignored,"" he said.

China's special climate envoy Xie Zhenhua said on Tuesday that Beijing is committed to reaching carbon neutrality in the world's top greenhouse gas emitter, and believed multilateralism and cooperation is key to solving global climate change.

""No matter how much the external environment changes, and no matter how many challenges we face, China has firm determination to achieve this vision of carbon neutrality,"" he told delegates.

The hosts of the COP27 climate talks on Tuesday launched a global plan to help the world's poorest communities withstand the impacts of global warming, including targets for sustainable farming, mangrove restoration to reduce coastal flooding, and access to clean cookstoves.

The head of the World Trade Organization, meanwhile, told Reuters she aimed to revive negotiations on a global environmental trade deal as part of efforts to give the trade watchdog a bigger role in tackling climate change.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told conference delegates in a video message that Russia's invasion of Ukraine has distracted world governments from efforts to combat climate change and boosted demand for coal.

""There can be no effective climate policy without the peace,"" he said.

Scores of other heads of state and government spoke on Monday and Tuesday but many of the world's biggest polluters - including the United States and India - have yet to hit the podium.

Biden will not arrive until Friday - after Tuesday's midterm elections in the United States - but his delegation opened its pavilion at the COP27 venue on Tuesday and Special Envoy John Kerry was making the rounds.

Conference host Egypt was facing pressure over its jailing of Egyptian-British blogger Alaa Abd el-Fattah, who rose to prominence during Egypt's 2011 popular uprising but has been detained for most of the time since and is now on hunger strike.

His family said on Tuesday they had not heard from him since he had been due to stop drinking water two days ago.

Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi's government came to power after heading the 2013 overthrow of Egypt's first democratically elected leader, and has drawn human rights criticism after subsequent bloody crackdowns on protesters and the detention of dissidents.

His government has been hoping its hosting of the COP27 conference would give it an injection of international legitimacy at a time its economy has been struggling.

Economic development. It was the fundamental challenge of the post-colonial era, embodying an economic, political, moral imperative: How could the poor world in the global south become as rich as the rich nations of the north? The question was never satisfactorily answered. Strategies hawked from opposite ideological corners mostly failed to deliver.

Then the question changed. As the heads of state and government filing in from around the world to Sharm-El-Sheikh in Egypt for the United Nations’ 27th climate change summit might put it, the new challenge of global development can be posed as: How can the poor south become as rich as the rich north without broiling?

Climate change poses a stark challenge to the development imperative. Floods and drought, hurricanes and heat waves will make the path out of poverty much more difficult. But trying to limit climate change poses its own set of problems for the developing world.

Few have grasped the full implications of the additional climate roadblock. But it is disrupting the “development agenda,” inserting new tension between the aspirations of people in developing countries and policymakers in the world of the rich. Leaders in the global south, already skeptical of industrialized nations’ interest in assisting their development, have a powerful new reason to distrust ostensible do-gooders from the developed world.

It’s baked in by now that if progress in the combat against climate change continues along the same path as the last decade or two, the world will broil even if the poor stay poor. The carbon spewed into the atmosphere thus far has drastically lengthened the odds of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above the average of the late 19th century. The latest analysis by the UN Environment Program estimates that pledges for countries around the world put the global temperature on track to rise around 2.5C by the end of the century.

Moreover, the aspiration of achieving “net zero” CO2 emissions by 2050 looks like a fantasy. By the admittedly conservative projections of the US Energy Information Administration, we are set to blow past this target several times over. The EIA’s baseline projection — which is based on current economic and demographic trends and assumes steady progress on decarbonization along historical pathways — has it that carbon emissions from energy use in 2050 will total some 43 billion tons of CO2, up from 36 billion last year.

This is partly because rich nations already have a lot of capital and technology, which will help them decarbonize their economies more quickly. What’s more, their populations are barely growing.

The population of poorer nations outside the OECD, by contrast, will grow by 1.5 billion people over the period, according to the EIA baseline projection. These people will aspire to higher living standards than their forebears. Improving living standards, everywhere and always throughout human history, has required consuming more energy. That’s where most of the CO2 emissions will come from.

The growth of CO2 emissions can be decomposed into the product of changes in population, GDP per person, the amount of energy needed to produce GDP and the amount of carbon emitted for each unit of energy used.

Advertisement

Current efforts to combat climate change focus on the last two elements: energy efficiency and carbon intensity, which can be improved with technology. The other two needles are very hard to move. Still, let’s say we could stop the world population from growing. If other things remain equal, we would still blast way past our carbon budget.

It’s tough even under rosier scenarios than the EIA’s. Assuming the world could double its projected progress in reducing the amount of carbon emitted to produce a dollar of GDP, other things being equal, countries around the globe would still emit more than 23 billion tons of CO2 in 2050 — a third less than last year but still substantially more than the target of zero.

To hit the target, all sorts of things must change much faster than they have so far. The International Energy Agency says that energy use per dollar of GDP over the next 10 years must fall over 2.5 times faster than in the last decade. Solar and wind energy must account for 41% of power generation in 2030, up from 11% last year. Even if every country in the world meets the decarbonization pledges it has made so far, the IEA estimates that the global supply of renewable energy will still be some 20% short of what is needed to hit the zero-emissions target by the middle of the century.

The incipient awareness of how tough the decarbonization task is has led activists and policymakers step-by-step down interesting paths. On the more alarmed side sit efforts like those of the Carnegie Climate Governance Initiative, which is trying to persuade countries to develop principles that would govern the deployment of geoengineering technologies, which may well be needed to reflect sunlight back into space and temporarily cool the planet.

On the other end, many environmental organizations have taken to whistling past the graveyard, hoping that their favored technologies — essentially solar and wind power — will somehow set the world on a path to zero sometime soon without having to deploy technologies like nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage, which they don’t like.

Still, the rising alarm over missing the targets has given renewed credence to an old, recurrent proposition: that the enemy is economic growth itself. Some activists are framing the battle against climate change as part of the effort to stop humanity’s excessive exploitation of the natural environment. To set things straight, they propose, humanity must turn the development imperative on its head and forfeit economic growth entirely.

Advertisement

Even this stratagem would fail to achieve the world’s climate goals. Based on the EIA projections, a world in which each country’s GDP per person was frozen in 2021 would still be spewing 24 billion tons of CO2 into the air in 2050.

What’s more, leaders of the global south will not take kindly to the proposition that they should lay the development dream to rest. Which again raises the question, what would meeting the development challenge entail? What would happen to the climate if everybody got rich?

Max Roser at Our World in Data posed this question in a concrete, intuitively graspable way: What would happen if every country in the world converged on Denmark’s prosperity?

Denmark has a pretty decent standard of living. Bernie Sanders likes it. For billions of people around the world, hitting Denmark’s 2021 GDP per person by midcentury would be an outstanding achievement. This world would also be a more equitable place. GDP per head in richer countries, like the United States, would have to shrink over the next 30 years, granting “carbon space” for less developed regions to grow.

Advertisement

This is likely a world with a lot of carbon in the air. Based on the EIA’s base scenario for population growth and technological progress toward removing carbon from the economy, achieving the longstanding development goal would raise CO2 emissions in 2050 to 79 billion tons — more than double the emissions of 2021.

This, however, is the challenge the world must set out to tackle. Not only would it be immoral to condemn the poor world to remain poor. The proposition would never fly in Lagos, New Delhi or Beijing. And any strategy to reduce climate emissions will require their wholehearted collaboration.

Would we broil? Robust economic growth in the global south would probably speed up technological progress and investment in new energy systems to decarbonize the world’s energy supply — helping contain changes in the climate. What’s more, fast economic growth would help poorer countries adapt to whatever climate change will unleash upon them.

Advertisement

Could the global economy wean itself of carbon? Limiting worldwide emissions to under 1 billion tons in 2050 would require releasing no more than a gram of CO2 for each dollar of GDP. That amounts to a 28th of the carbon released from making a dollar of GDP today, and one-eighth of the carbon efficiency the EIA baseline projects for 2050.

We must move eight times faster. That’s the scale of the challenge.

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt (AP) — It was a total loss — the type that is usually glossed over in big impersonal statistics like $40 billion in damage from this summer's Pakistan floods that put one-third of the nation underwater.

“We lost everything, our home and our possessions,” said Taj Mai, a mother of seven who is four months pregnant and in a flood relief camp in Pakistan’s Punjab province. “At least in a camp our children will get food and milk.”

This is the human side of a contentious issue that will likely dominate climate negotiations in Egypt this month. It's about big bucks, justice, blame and taking responsibility. Extreme weather is worsening as the world warms, with a study calculating that human-caused climate change increased Pakistan’s flood-causing rain by up to 50%.

While Pakistan was flooding, six energy companies — ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell,BP, Saudi Aramco and Total Energies — made $97.49 billion in profits from July to September. Poorer nations, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Europe’s leaders and U.S. President Joe Biden are calling for fossil fuel firms to pay a windfall profits tax. Many want some of that money, along with additional aid from rich nations that spewed the lion’s share of heat-trapping gases, to be used to pay countries victimized by past pollution, like Pakistan.

The issue of polluters paying for their climate messes is called loss and damage in international climate negotiations. It is all about reparations.

“Loss and damage is going to be the priority and the defining factor of whether or not COP27 succeeds,” said Kenyan climate activist Elizabeth Wathuti, referring to the climate talks in Egypt . United Nations top officials say they are looking for “something meaningful in loss and damage"" and were “certainly encouraged” by negotiations Friday, Saturday and Sunday that put the issue on the meeting agenda.

Money for loss and damage is different from two other financial aid systems already in place to help poorer nations develop carbon-free energy and adapt to future warming.

Since 2009, the rich nations of the world have promised to spend $100 billion in climate aid for poor nations, with most of it going toward helping wean them off coal, oil and natural gas and build greener energy systems. Officials now want as much as half of that to go to building up systems to help adapt to future climate disasters.

Neither financial pledge has been fulfilled yet, but both don't address the issue of paying for current and past climate disasters, such as heat waves in India, floods in Pakistan and droughts in Africa.

“Our current levels of global warming at 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) have already caused dangerous and widespread losses and damages to nature and to billions of people,” said Climate Analytics scientist Adelle Thomas of the Bahamas.

“Losses and damages are unavoidable and unequally distributed” with poorer nations, the elderly, the poor and vulnerable hit harder, she said.

After years of not wanting to talk about reparations in climate talks, U.S. and European officials say they are willing to have loss and damage discussions. But the U.S. — the No. 1 historic carbon polluter — won’t agree to anything that sounds like liability, special envoy John Kerry said.

U.S. emissions that created warmer temperatures caused at least $32 billion in damage to Pakistan’s gross domestic product between 1990 and 2014, according to calculations by Dartmouth climate researchers Christopher Callahan and Justin Mankin based on past emissions. And that's only based on temperature-oriented damage, not rainfall.

“Loss and damage is a way of both recognizing past harm and compensating for that past harm,” Mankin said. “These harms are scientifically identifiable. And now it’s up to the politics to either defend that harm or remunerate for that harm.”

The United States in 16 days puts more carbon dioxide into the air from burning fossil fuel than Pakistan does in a year, according to figures by the Global Carbon Project.

American Gas Association CEO Karen Harbert said Americans won’t go for such payments to faraway nations and that’s not the way to think of the issue.

“It’s not just Pakistan. Let’s talk about Puerto Rico. Let’s talk about Louisiana. Other things that are happening here at home that we also need to pay attention to and help our fellow Americans,” Harbert said in an interview with The Associated Press.

“If there was an opportunity to talk to people in Pakistan, I’d say ... the solution is first of all, you have the opportunity with natural gas to have a much cleaner electric system than you have today,” she said.

But for Aaisa Bibi, a pregnant mother of four from Punjab province, cheaper cleaner energy doesn’t mean much when her family has no place to live except a refugee camp.

“With less than 1% of the global emissions, Pakistan is certainly not a part of the problem of climate change,"" said Shabnam Baloch, the International Rescue Committee Pakistan director, adding that people like Bibi are just trying to survive floods, heat waves, droughts, low crop yields, water shortages and inflation.

In semi-arid Makueni County in Kenya, where a devastating drought has stretched more than three years, 47-year old goat and sheep farmer John Gichuki said: “It is traumatizing to watch your livestock die of thirst and hunger.”

Gichuki’s maize and legumes crops have failed four consecutive seasons. “The farm is solely on the mercies of climate,"" he said.

In India, it's record heat connected to climate change that caused deaths and ruined crops. Elsewhere it's devastation from tropical cyclones that are wetter and stronger because of the burning of fossil fuels.

This global issue has a parallel inside the United States in at times contentious discussions about paying for damages caused by slavery.

“In many ways we’re talking about reparations,” said University of Maryland environmental health and justice professor Sacoby Wilson. “It's an appropriate term to use"" he said, because the rich northern countries got the benefits of fossil fuels, while the poorer global south gets the damage in floods, droughts, climate refugees and hunger.

The government of Barbados has suggested changes in how the multinational development banks loan to poorer nations to take into account climate vulnerability and disasters. Pakistan and others have called for debt relief.

It's ""about putting ourselves in everybody else’s shoes,” said Avinash Persaud, special envoy to Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley.

Persaud suggests a long-term levy on high oil, coal and natural gas prices, but one done in reverse. At current high energy prices there would be no tax, so no increase in inflation. But once fossil fuel prices decline 10%, 1% of the price drop would go to a fund to pay victims of climate loss and damage, without adding to the cost of living.

United Nations' chief Guterres, who has called movement on loss and damage a “litmus test” for success for the Egypt climate conference, has named two high-level national officials to try to hammer out a deal: Germany's climate envoy and former Greenpeace chief Jennifer Morgan and Chile’s environment minister, Maisa Rojas.

“The fact that it has been adopted as an agenda item demonstrates progress and parties taking a mature and constructive attitude towards this,” U.N. Climate Secretary Simon Stiell said in a Sunday news conference. ""This is a difficult subject area. It’s been floating for thirty plus years. So that the fact that it is there as a substantive agenda item, I believe it bodes well.''

“What will be most telling is how those discussions progress in the substantive discussion over the next couple of weeks,” Stiell said.

605422a9-00d4-44b3-8884-1f82b73cc957,"For small islands in the Pacific, a powerful cyclone can be devastating. In 2020, Cyclone Harold hit the island nation of Vanuatu, destroying schools and fields of crops. In one province, 90% of the population lost their homes.

The $600 million in damage represents more than 60% of the country's gross domestic product.

""This is huge sums of our national wealth that is being erased by climate extremes,"" says Christopher Bartlett, who works on climate diplomacy for Vanuatu.

Vanuatu is part of a coalition of low-income countries calling on wealthier nations to pay for climate damages. Developing countries have produced very little of the pollution driving climate change. Wealthier nations such as the United States have been the biggest emitters of greenhouse gasses. But developing countries are already bearing the brunt of the destructive impacts, like storms, floods and droughts.

With the world far off-track from its goal of stopping dangerous levels of warming, developing countries say that wealthier nations should pay for the inevitable ""loss and damage"" they'll experience.

So far, richer countries have delayed committing funds, though they've agreed to take up the issue at the COP27 climate negotiations now getting underway in Egypt. At last year's summit, nations agreed to start a dialogue about loss and damage, a process that developing countries say has fallen far short.

The Biden administration has signaled its support for addressing loss and damage. But dollar amounts are still elusive, and it's not clear how payments might be delivered.

Talks about money at COP27 are happening as richer countries face their own economic turmoil, including inflation, possible recession and energy upheaval stemming from the Russian war in Ukraine. But without progress on loss and damage, the chances get a lot slimmer that the world can stick together on an already difficult path to cutting emissions.

""For some group of developing countries, for them it could be the last straw,"" says Preety Bhandari, senior advisor on climate finance at the World Resources Institute. ""It really could be the last straw and they might be ready to walk out.""

$177 million: Vanuatu's starting point for climate compensation

For Vanuatu, a South Pacific nation made up of 82 small islands, few people are insulated from a changing climate. Agriculture there largely depends on rainfall patterns. Fishing is a vital industry. Many people live close to the coast.

The country's leaders have made it clear that climate change threatens Vanuatu's very survival. To advance the conversation at COP27, Vanuatu has laid out a starting point for its loss and damage needs, totaling $177 million.

""What is happening now is affecting human lives and human rights,"" says Bakoa Kaltongga, Vanuatu's climate envoy. ""We small islands and people of the small islands have every right to exist in the world, just as all you major nations of the north.""

The plan doesn't include disaster relief from cyclones, which are getting stronger and more intense as global temperatures rise. An international system of humanitarian aid generally kicks into gear after a crisis, though it often falls short of supporting a full recovery.

Vanuatu's leaders say it's the slower-moving climate impacts that are hard to get help with, like rising oceans. On Vanuatu's coast, water is rising at a faster rate than the global average. Many coastal communities may need to be relocated, a fraught and challenging process in any part of the world.

The bulk of Vanuatu's proposal would go to creating a loss and damage fund, so residents could receive compensation quickly. Other funding would go to setting up systems to help with relocation efforts and support displaced people.

""It's to ensure that as we relocate populations, that we do that in an advance-planned way so people can move with dignity and not be scrambling at the last minute without the basic services and protections that we deserve,"" Bartlett says.

Loss and damage also means paying for what can't be replaced

While communities can potentially be rebuilt in new places, some of what's lost can't be regained. Important cultural sites may disappear under rising water. In Vanuatu, burial grounds are at risk, so some funding would also go to community-led discussions about how best to preserve their connection to ancestors.

""I can't tell you how many times when entering the community that you see graves and grave sites half exposed to the rising tides,"" Bartlett says. ""And it's devastating because that's such an important connection to history and ancestry here in the Pacific.""

The country's coral reefs are also at risk of collapsing. Oceans are getting warmer and more acidic, which can cause corals to bleach, turning a ghostly white. After repeated marine heat waves, corals simply can't bounce back.

Losing reefs would be fundamentally destabilizing, both as an ecological change and for the many local fishermen who depend on them for their livelihoods.

Debate remains over how loss and damage payments would work

Worldwide, the toll of loss and damage is expected to balloon as the climate gets hotter. One study shows that costs from loss and damage could reach $290 billion to $580 billion in 2030 and rise to more than $1 trillion per year in 2050.

At last year's climate talks in Glasgow, a bloc of developing nations asked for a fund or ""facility"" to be set up to disburse loss and damage funds. But as negotiations wore on, they settled on a three-year dialogue, which developing countries say lacks a clear decision-making mandate.

At this year's negotiations in Egypt, the debate is expected to continue over whether a new fund should be set up. Some support using existing humanitarian aid networks. Others have suggested that countries should have international loans forgiven, if it's linked to their climate vulnerability. Many countries have already taken on more debt after major disasters hit, on top of international loans they have for broader societal development.

""Many of these countries are burdened by debt,"" says U.S. special climate envoy John Kerry. ""They are greatly impacted by what happens with respect to the crisis, the climate. And then they turn around and the west or the north offers them more debt. That isn't going to work.""

Talks this year could take on new urgency, however, after the unprecedented damage in Pakistan from extreme floods. Millions of people were displaced, with damage totaling more than $30 billion dollars. At least 1500 people were killed.

""The recent floods in Pakistan have clearly shown what loss and damage can look like and what the toll could be,"" Bhandari says. ""Not only in terms of human lives and economic losses, but also in terms of all the development gains which are being lost in countries which are really trying to leapfrog into the next level of development.""

It was a total loss — the type that is usually glossed over in big impersonal statistics like $40 billion in damage from this summer's Pakistan floods that put one-third of the nation underwater.

“We lost everything, our home and our possessions,” said Taj Mai, a mother of seven who is four months pregnant and in a flood relief camp in Pakistan’s Punjab province. “At least in a camp our children will get food and milk.”

This is the human side of a contentious issue that will likely dominate climate negotiations in Egypt this month. It's about big bucks, justice, blame and taking responsibility. Extreme weather is worsening as the world warms, with a study calculating that human-caused climate change increased Pakistan’s flood-causing rain by up to 50%.

While Pakistan was flooding, six energy companies — ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell,BP, Saudi Aramco and Total Energies — made $97.49 billion in profits from July to September. Poorer nations, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Europe’s leaders and U.S. President Joe Biden are calling for fossil fuel firms to pay a windfall profits tax. Many want some of that money, along with additional aid from rich nations that spewed the lion’s share of heat-trapping gases, to be used to pay countries victimized by past pollution, like Pakistan.

The issue of polluters paying for their climate messes is called loss and damage in international climate negotiations. It is all about reparations.

“Loss and damage is going to be the priority and the defining factor of whether or not COP27 succeeds,” said Kenyan climate activist Elizabeth Wathuti, referring to the climate talks in Egypt . United Nations top officials say they are looking for “something meaningful in loss and damage"" and were “certainly encouraged” by negotiations Friday, Saturday and Sunday that put the issue on the meeting agenda.

Money for loss and damage is different from two other financial aid systems already in place to help poorer nations develop carbon-free energy and adapt to future warming.

Since 2009, the rich nations of the world have promised to spend $100 billion in climate aid for poor nations, with most of it going toward helping wean them off coal, oil and natural gas and build greener energy systems. Officials now want as much as half of that to go to building up systems to help adapt to future climate disasters.

Neither financial pledge has been fulfilled yet, but both don't address the issue of paying for current and past climate disasters, such as heat waves in India, floods in Pakistan and droughts in Africa.

“Our current levels of global warming at 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) have already caused dangerous and widespread losses and damages to nature and to billions of people,” said Climate Analytics scientist Adelle Thomas of the Bahamas.

“Losses and damages are unavoidable and unequally distributed” with poorer nations, the elderly, the poor and vulnerable hit harder, she said.

After years of not wanting to talk about reparations in climate talks, U.S. and European officials say they are willing to have loss and damage discussions. But the U.S. — the No. 1 historic carbon polluter — won’t agree to anything that sounds like liability, special envoy John Kerry said.

U.S. emissions that created warmer temperatures caused at least $32 billion in damage to Pakistan’s gross domestic product between 1990 and 2014, according to calculations by Dartmouth climate researchers Christopher Callahan and Justin Mankin based on past emissions. And that's only based on temperature-oriented damage, not rainfall.

“Loss and damage is a way of both recognizing past harm and compensating for that past harm,” Mankin said. “These harms are scientifically identifiable. And now it’s up to the politics to either defend that harm or remunerate for that harm.”

The United States in 16 days puts more carbon dioxide into the air from burning fossil fuel than Pakistan does in a year, according to figures by the Global Carbon Project.

American Gas Association CEO Karen Harbert said Americans won’t go for such payments to faraway nations and that’s not the way to think of the issue.

“It’s not just Pakistan. Let’s talk about Puerto Rico. Let’s talk about Louisiana. Other things that are happening here at home that we also need to pay attention to and help our fellow Americans,” Harbert said in an interview with The Associated Press.

“If there was an opportunity to talk to people in Pakistan, I’d say ... the solution is first of all, you have the opportunity with natural gas to have a much cleaner electric system than you have today,” she said.

But for Aaisa Bibi, a pregnant mother of four from Punjab province, cheaper cleaner energy doesn’t mean much when her family has no place to live except a refugee camp.

“With less than 1% of the global emissions, Pakistan is certainly not a part of the problem of climate change,"" said Shabnam Baloch, the International Rescue Committee’s country director, adding that people like Bibi are just trying to survive floods, heat waves, droughts, low crop yields, water shortages and inflation.

In semi-arid Makueni County in Kenya, where a devastating drought has stretched more than three years, 47-year old goat and sheep farmer John Gichuki said: “It is traumatizing to watch your livestock die of thirst and hunger.”

Gichuki’s maize and legumes crops have failed four consecutive seasons. “The farm is solely on the mercies of climate,"" he said.

904058ef-def7-41b2-8859-8a35f60dc671,"One of the thorniest issues at the United Nations' annual climate negotiations in Egypt is how to get money to low-income countries to help them cope with climate change.

Governments of industrialized countries, whose emissions have largely driven global warming, have pledged help. But public funds alone can't cover the trillions of dollars developing countries need to deal with rising temperatures.

Many private investors see big opportunities to propel — and profit from — the fight against climate change. Yet little of their money is going to poorer nations, which already bear the brunt of extreme weather despite contributing little of the pollution that fuels climate change.

""I think there the story is not good. And that's because most of the big funds — pension funds, asset managers, new tech funds — they invest in advanced economies,"" says Bella Tonkonogy, a director at the Climate Policy Initiative, a nonprofit that works with governments and businesses to promote economic growth while addressing climate change. ""There's a lot that needs to be done to make it viable for that kind of big money now being raised to be invested in emerging economies.""

A big barrier to private investment is the perception that risks in developing countries are greater than in industrialized nations. To better manage cross-border challenges like climate change, government leaders say it's time to overhaul institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which use money from the public sector to attract private investment to emerging economies.

But world leaders say it's also in the private sector's interest to play a bigger role in helping poorer nations deal with climate change.

""I'm not here to tell the private sector to give up caring about profits,"" Philip Davis, prime minister of the Bahamas, said at the U.N. climate conference. ""I'm here to say that in a world of profound instability, your profits are very much in danger.""

World leaders are trying to build a 'highway' for climate finance into developing countries

Investors in private markets and on public stock exchanges plowed $165 billion into climate technology companies in 2021, according to BloombergNEF, roughly equivalent to the gross domestic product of Algeria.

While it's difficult to track and compare sources of climate funding, that's vastly more money than developing countries have been getting from private investors. Of the $83.3 billion in climate financing that went to developing nations in 2020, just $13.1 billion was from private sources, according to the latest data from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.

Experts say the bulk of that private funding is being used for things like energy and transport projects that are aimed at reducing emissions in developing countries. That's because they tend to create more direct revenues for investors than adaptation projects like building flood defenses, which are designed to help countries cope with warming that's already happening.

Ahmad Gharabli / AFP via Getty Images / AFP via Getty Images The Bahamas' Prime Minister Philip Davis warned that climate change threatens corporate profits.

""The key opportunity area right now for private finance is very much renewable energy,"" says Amar Bhattacharya, who is part of an independent group of experts that was convened ahead of COP27 to advise conference leaders on how to increase climate financing. ""But there isn't a kind of ready-made highway, as yet, for the flow of large private finance into emerging and developing countries' investment opportunities.""

Africa, for example, accounts for a large share of the world's potential solar development but attracts just a small fraction of renewable energy investment, says Enja Sæthren, head of government affairs at Scatec ASA, a project developer with a lot of experience in developing countries. Plenty of investors are willing to back projects in Africa that produce reliable profits, Sæthren says. However, those sorts of deals can be hard to come by because they require developers with ""strong market knowledge and a network to navigate different stakeholders,"" she says.

A lack of infrastructure is also a problem. In some places, project developers are finding they can't build at the scale they would like, because there hasn't been enough public investment to expand local electric grids, said Katie Auth of the Energy for Growth Hub, which promotes energy policies that align with countries' development goals, in Washington, D.C. in October.

That underscores the need for governments and development banks to create the right conditions for private investment.

Calls to update development banks grow louder

Multilateral development banks like the World Bank give financial and technical support to developing nations, which can help to reduce risk and attract private investors.

But many say the system needs updating to draw the private investment required to fight climate change. Of the roughly $2.6 trillion needed annually over the next few years to eliminate or offset planet-warming emissions by midcentury, 70% could come from the private sector, says Citi, the U.S. bank.

Despite their mandate to eliminate poverty, development banks tend to focus too much on avoiding risk and earnings profits, says Jacqueline Novogratz, the CEO of Acumen, a firm that invests in developing countries. What they should be doing is trying to attract as much private investment as possible to developing countries to ""make real change,"" she says.

In October, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen called for international development banks to rethink how they incentivize investment, especially for global challenges like climate change that span national borders. That could include issuing more grants instead of loans to provide funding. ""If the global community benefits from investments in climate, then the global community should help bear the cost,"" Yellen said in prepared remarks at Center for Global Development in Washington, D.C.

U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry has echoed Yellen, saying the world needs to ""reimagine"" the system of development banks that emerged after World War II.

""Public finance is an indispensable component, mostly to unlock private investment on the scale that is needed in order to finance the energy revolution — to de-risk, to create blended finance,"" Kerry said in October at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, D.C.

""We need a greater synergy between public and private finance,"" Kerry added. ""It's been talked about for a long time; it's got to happen.""

In a joint statement at the start of the UN climate conference, a group of 10 development banks including the World Bank and European Investment Bank, said that increasing private investment in low-income countries is among their ""critical priorities."" The banks say they're focused on reducing financial risk and ensuring countries have plenty of attractive projects to offer investors.

For those looking for a breakthrough at this year's climate conference in the Egyptian resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh, the United Nations meetings often feature big announcements. But turning promises into action has been the problem.

""My frustration is often that we speak with these grand statements: What needs to be done, what we will stand for,"" Novogratz says. ""What we need to do is start to put together real [investment programs], real promises, to enable those organizations that know how to execute on the ground.""

A deal unveiled Monday at COP27 offers a glimpse of what that might look like.

Africa's SouthBridge Investments and the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa say they're creating a $2 billion fund to offer grants and loans to communities and entrepreneurs that are restoring land in Africa. Most of the money is coming from private investors. The Bezos Earth Fund is chipping in $50 million of philanthropic funding.

Ani Dasgupta, CEO of World Resources Institute, says the new investment fund is a ""breakthrough"" in getting money directly into the hands of local businesses and nonprofits.

""Africa is a youthful continent,"" Frannie Leautier, CEO of SouthBridge Investments, said in a statement. ""Faced with crises, it has evolved to be the innovation factory of the Earth.""

The UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, was at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh Egypt yesterday, where he made a raft of UK adaptation-related announcements including a £95 million Propcom+ investment that is set to benefit at least 4 million Nigerians, including 2 million women, to increase productivity and adapt to the effects of climate change while at the same time reducing emissions.

P ropcom+ builds on the UK government’s investment in agriculture through the Propcom Mai-karfi programme in Nigeria. This new £95 million Propcom+ programme is set to help address key barriers to sustainable agricultural development in Nigeria.

It will support the development of climate-resilient agricultural policies, actions, and investments that deliver nutrition, increase productivity, adapt and build resilience while reducing emissions, and protect and restore natural ecosystems through the adoption and scaling of practices such as heat and flood tolerant crop varieties and integrated soil fertility management.

The new Propcom+ programme involves supporting inclusive and resilient growth by promoting the progressive transformation of Nigeria’s rural economy. The new programme will build the capacity of small-scale farmers and rural communities in climate smart agriculture.

It will work with Nigeria’s vibrant private sector on agriculture to increase productivity, improve nutrition and food security, enhance climate resilience, pursue lower emissions and halt and reverse biodiversity loss, as well as helping to tackle some of Nigeria’s underlying drivers of conflict and insecurity.

Cleverly said the Glasgow Climate Pact gave the world the tools to limit the rise in global temperature to 1.5 degrees and build a secure and sustainable future. Now is the time for all countries to step up their action on climate change and deliver the tangible change needed. The UK will continue to play a leading role in this mission.

“The funding we have announced will support countries which are facing the devastating impact of climate change, to adapt effectively,” he said.

Ben Llewellyn-Jones, UK deputy high commissioner in Lagos, said Nigeria is extremely vulnerable to climate change and land degradation.

“Climate risks are increasing, diminishing productive capacity, and contributing to worsening food insecurity. Farmers are on the front line and highly dependent on seasonal rainfall making them increasingly vulnerable to the changing and unpredictable climate,” Llewellyn-Jones said.

“Tackling climate change and biodiversity loss is a key UK international priority and we remain committed to supporting inclusive and climate resilient growth in Nigeria through the Propcom+ programme which will build on the successes and lessons from previous engagement and deliver on adaptation and resilience, and on nature for climate and people,” he said.

The UK says it is proud to support Nigeria’s climate, environment and energy ambitions in the leadup to COP27. Through programmes such as Propcom+, UK PACT (Partnering for Accelerated Climate Transitions), UKNIAF (UK-Nigeria Infrastructure Advisory Facility), and FSD (Financial Sector Deepening) Africa, amongst others, the UK supports Nigeria on protecting and restoring nature, climate adaptation and resilience, promoting access to climate finance, clean energy, sustainable cities, infrastructure and transport.

Under the UK’s COP Presidency, almost all developed country climate finance providers made new, forward-looking climate finance commitments, with many doubling or even quadrupling support for developing countries to take climate action."
a9f14a5e-f149-42c4-b699-7ae0bf2ae19d,"A trillion dollars of that should come from rich countries, investors and multilateral development banks, UN-backed report says.

Developing and emerging countries excluding China need investments well beyond $2 trillion annually by 2030 if the world is to stop the global warming juggernaut and cope with its effects, according to a United Nations-backed report.

A trillion dollars should come from rich countries, investors and multilateral development banks, said the analysis commissioned by Britain and Egypt, hosts respectively of the 2021 UN climate summit in Glasgow and this week’s COP27 event in Sharm el-Sheikh.

The rest of the money – about $1.4 trillion – must originate domestically from private and public sources, the report released on Tuesday said.

Current investments in emerging and developing economies other than China stand at about $500bn.

“The world needs a breakthrough and a new roadmap on climate finance that can mobilise the $1 trillion in external finance that will be needed by 2030 for emerging markets and developing countries (EMDC) other than China,” the report said.

The new 100-page analysis, Finance for Climate Action, is presented as an investment blueprint for greening the global economy quickly enough to meet Paris climate treaty goals of capping the rise in global temperatures below two degrees Celsius, and at 1.5C, if possible. Warming beyond that threshold, scientists warn, could push Earth towards an unliveable hothouse state.

The report is among the first to map out the investment needed across the three broad areas covered in UN climate talks: reduction of the greenhouse gas emissions that drive warming (mitigation), adapting to future climate effects (adaptation), and compensating poor and vulnerable nations for unavoidable damages already incurred, known as “loss and damage”.

One of the report leads Vera Songwe said “unlocking substantial climate finance was key” to solving development challenges today.

“This means countries must have access to affordable, sustainable low-cost financing from the multilateral development banks to help crowd in investments from the private sector and philanthropy to support the energy transformation, build resilience and protect natural capital,” she said in a press release.

“Financing alone is not enough and must be coupled with the right instruments and good policies to accelerate and scale up impact.”

Fossil fuel lock-in

The report calls for grants and low-interest loans from the governments of developed countries to double from about $30bn annually today to $60bn by 2025.

“These sources of finance are critical for emerging markets and developing countries to support action on restoring land and nature, and for protecting against and responding to the loss and damage due to climate change impacts,” the authors said.

“Emerging market” countries include large economies in the Global South that have seen rapid growth – coupled with rising greenhouse gas emissions – in recent decades, including India, Brazil, South Africa, Indonesia and Vietnam.

Historically seen as part of this group, China was excluded from the new estimates, presumably because of its unique and hybrid status.

Its economy – the second largest in the world – is in many respects advanced, and Beijing has positioned itself as a major international investor in its own right, through its Belt and Road Initiative and the promotion of “South-South” investment across the developing world.

In the context of climate change, developing nations include the world’s poorest economies, many of them in Africa, and those most vulnerable to climate hazards, such as small island states facing existential threats from sea-level rise and ever more powerful cyclones.

“Most of the growth in energy infrastructure and consumption projected to occur over the next decade will be in emerging market and developing countries,” said the other co-lead of the report, Nicholas Stern.

“If they lock in dependence on fossil fuels and emissions, the world will not be able to avoid dangerous climate change, damaging and destroying billions of lives and livelihoods in both rich and poor countries,” he added."

Unfortunately, warm words are not enough. By the time that the last of the corporate stalls had been packed away, it was clear that the conference had failed.

There were some positive steps and agreements, particularly when it came to coal reduction and deforestation. But the overall package did not live up to the scale of the challenge or go anywhere near far enough.

In the months since we have seen record heat waves. Wildfires and droughts have spread across Europe. We have also seen catastrophic flooding in Pakistan, which has wiped out thousands of homes and displaced millions of people.

Energy bills have skyrocketed due to surging gas prices, plunging millions of households in the UK and beyond into fuel poverty. All of this has been made worse by our over reliance on fossil fuels and by Vladimir Putin’s brutal invasion of Ukraine.

If we are to have any hope of reaching net-zero then this year’s COP has to reach big and meaningful agreements and succeed in all of the areas where last year’s summit failed.

Despite the backdrop of chaos and the pressing need for change, far too many governments are putting their heads in the sand.

If we take the UK Government for example, it is doubling down on the same failed policies that brought us to this point.

Downing Street has already announced that it will approve another 130 new oil and gas exploration licences. It is an utterly reckless and irresponsible move, and the worst kind of climate vandalism.

With some of the world’s most skilled engineers and 25 per cent of Europe’s potential offshore wind capacity, Scotland could play a vital role in securing a just transition from oil and gas.

With Greens in the Scottish Government, there are already hugely important steps that we are already taking: a £500 million just transition fund, increased investment in renewables, recycling, nature and record funding for for walking, wheeling and cycling infrastructure.

But, when it comes to tackling the climate crisis and cutting bills, the most important powers all lie with Westminster.

From taxing the obscene wealth of the oil and gas companies to taking these companies into public ownership and curbing the out-of-control price hikes, these things can only be done from Downing Street.

With the powers of independence we could take big leaps towards sustainability, like banning new oil and gas fields, fixing the broken energy market and implementing a Green New Deal that invests in our communities, our workers and our future.

I look forward to the day when we can advocate for these vital policies at future COP events, and do so as a normal and independent country.

The decisions that are made in Egypt over the days ahead will have consequences for generations to come. Let us all hope that the decision-makers in the room show the boldness and ambition that is needed.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​"
56c1c558-9952-4ae4-804d-fc0cd08930da,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday condemned Russia’s invasion of his country for exacerbating the “catastrophic” effects of climate change.

“There are still many for whom climate change is just rhetoric or marketing or political ritual,” Zelensky said in a video address to the United Nations climate change conference (COP27).

“They are the ones who start wars of aggression when the planet cannot afford a single gunshot because it needs global joint actions,” the president continued.

Slamming Russia for its attempts to “destroy the independence” of Ukraine, Zelensky described a situation in which dozens of countries have now had to resume coal-fired power generation to reduce energy prices following Moscow’s invasion.

He also blamed the Russian war for triggering “an acute food crisis” that has stricken countries that were already enduring “the existing manifestations of climate change, catastrophic drought, large-scale floods.” Russian shelling, the president added, ravaged 5 million acres of forest in Ukraine in less than six months.

Zelensky likewise accused Russia of turning the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant “de facto into a military training ground.

“They are constantly playing with connecting and disconnecting their plant and nuclear reactors from their power grid,” the president said, warning “there is direct risk of a radiation disaster.”

Zelensky called upon world leaders to “tell those who do not take the climate agenda seriously that they are making a catastrophic mistake.”

Russia’s “insane and illegal war,” he continued, is “destroying the world’s ability to work united for a common goal.”

The Ukrainian leader urged COP27 participants to support a Kyiv initiative presented at the summit that would create a global platform for assessing the impacts of military actions on the climate and the environment.

“We must ensure that suffering doesn’t multiply because the world doesn’t have time to respond to climate challenges,” Zelensky added.

d2a21869-9607-4779-bb07-d47e28570c1a,"Boris Johnson yesterday warned against going ‘weak and wobbly’ over tackling climate change as the cost of living crisis bites.

The former Prime Minister said the world was ‘failing’ in the battle to stop global temperatures rising and insisted that governments could not allow the situation to slip backwards.

Speaking at the Cop27 climate summit in Egypt, Mr Johnson hit out at members of the Tory Party who argue that soaring energy bills mean the UK can no longer afford to go green at the same pace.

Speaking at the Cop27 climate summit in Egypt, Mr Johnson hit out at members of the Tory Party who argue that soaring energy bills mean the UK can no longer afford to go green at the same pace

He said: ‘People have drawn the conclusion that the whole project of net zero needs to be delayed, mothballed and put on ice – for instance we need to reopen coal-fired power stations and frack the hell out of the British countryside. This is a moment where we really have to tackle this nonsense head-on.’

Net zero means reaching the point where the amount of carbon the UK adds to the atmosphere is no more than the amount it removes.

Mr Johnson’s comments will be seen as a swipe at ex-PM Liz Truss and her energy secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg, who briefly lifted the ban on fracking before it was reimposed by new Premier Rishi Sunak last month.

Mr Johnson said the UK was right to continue trying to exploit oil and gas reserves in the North Sea, saying they would be needed during the ‘transition’ to a greener economy.

But he added: ‘This is not the moment to abandon the campaign for net zero. This is not the moment to turn our backs on renewable technology.’

He warned the battle against climate change had become one of the ‘collateral victims’ of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with countries questioning the goal of cutting emissions at a time of soaring energy prices and rampant inflation.

He said: ‘The risk is some people will go weak and wobbly on net zero. We can’t have that.’

Asked whether he lies in bed worrying that the world is failing on the issue, he replied: ‘We are [failing]. Be in no doubt – at the current rate we are.’

The former Prime Minister said the world was ‘failing’ in the battle to stop global temperatures rising and insisted that governments could not allow the situation to slip backwards

He said world leaders had so far failed to meet pledges given at last year’s Cop26 summit in Glasgow to slow the pace of deforestation. Mr Johnson’s attendance at the United Nations climate summit has been widely seen as a factor in Mr Sunak’s decision to drop his previous plan to skip the event.

The ex-PM stressed he was not acting as a back-seat driver, telling a fringe event: ‘I’m a foot soldier, a spear carrier. I’m here in a purely supportive role and to remind the world what we did at Glasgow.’ He said the new Government ‘understands’ what needs to be done to tackle the climate threat and ‘wants to take it forward’.

Downing Street said there were no plans for Mr Sunak to meet Mr Johnson during the summit. But the new PM told The Sun he hoped he would ‘bump into’ him at some point, adding: ‘Isn’t it great we have a PM and a former PM both at Cop? That says something special about our country.’

He added: ‘Boris has been a stalwart champion of building a greener future – he deserves praise and credit for that. It’s great that he’s there.’

Mr Johnson also waded into the row over whether the West should make payments to developing countries after pouring carbon into the air following the industrial revolution. Former Labour leader Ed Miliband had called on the UK to acknowledge its ‘historical responsibility’ and send cash to nations hit by climate change, but rejected the term ‘reparation’.

Mr Johnson said: ‘Two hundred years ago, we started it all and there’s no question that, per capita, people in the UK have put out an awful lot of carbon into the atmosphere.

‘But what we cannot do is...make up for that with some kind of reparations. We simply do not have the financial resources – and no country could.’

He said the world should ‘look to the future’, adding: ‘The best way to fix this is not to look backwards and try to tot up some bill for loss and damage that the UK or other countries have done, but try to look at what the UK can do to help to take countries forward and help them achieve the carbon reductions and green technologies they need.’"

2caef346-f06d-4200-a01b-bec1efd0e387,"© Dean Lewins/AAP PHOTOS More than a billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions are released each year by seaborne ships.

Anthony Albanese says climate change is a critical national security issue, as Australia backed a plan at the COP27 climate conference to promote ""green"" shipping.

As delegates attend the annual climate summit in Cairo, the prime minister said Australia had an obligation to engage with Pacific countries on climate change.

""Climate change is a national security issue. That is something that is recognised by the United States, it's something that's recognised by our other partners, and indeed, our allies,"" he told parliament on Tuesday.

""What we won't be doing ... is trying to score a cheap domestic political point, and at the same time actually set back our international relations.""

Talks at COP27 have also centred on whether poorer countries should be compensated for damage linked to climate change.

The coalition had previously ruled out signing up to such a measure, and the government ducked the opposition's challenge to take the same position in parliament on Tuesday.

The comments come as Australia signed up for the Green Shipping Challenge at COP27 after being invited to join by US President Joe Biden at a forum in June.

More than a billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions are released each year by seaborne ships, which rely on low-grade bunker fuel.

Mr Albanese said it was important to act on climate change given the past eight years had been the warmest on record.

""We can look here at the increased number of extreme weather events and the increase in the severity of them,"" he said.

""We enshrined in law net zero by 2050, and we are investing in renewable energy. Climate change is a challenge for our generation.""

Meanwhile, Australia has become a member of a new international partnership on forest-based initiatives to help combat climate change.

The partnership, led by the UK, was launched at the summit, and will focus on stepping up efforts to halt the loss of forest land and degradation.

Other countries to be part of the Forests and Climate Leaders Partnership will include the US, South Korea, Canada and Norway.

Climate Change Minister Chris Bowen said the government would work with industry to help decarbonise the economy.

""Our forests will play a crucial role in this transition,"" he said in a statement.

""By joining this partnership, we will maintain the momentum of global action on climate change as we work to reduce our emissions by 43 per cent by 2030, and achieve net zero by 2050.""

Australian mining magnate Andrew ""Twiggy'' Forrest called for long-term thinking when addressing spiralling gas and power prices, saying only planning for the future could prevent entrenching current energy settings further.

""If you aren't thinking of your company beyond fossil fuels, there's two reasons only for that - you're lazy, or you have a vested interest to keep polluting the planet,"" he told the ABC.

""I'm on the front foot here, giving fossil fuel companies a hard time. They should be using their super profits now to be going green, to be giving their consumers energy that doesn't cook the planet.""

Mr Forrest has signed a joint agreement with Kenya to eliminate fossil fuels and instead harness the huge geothermal energy available in the African nation."

0d87b9a0-3abe-4de0-98c5-3599109b22f4,"An Indigenous climate activist from the Northwest Territories said he travelled to COP27 to advocate for climate change solutions that address the impact of climate change on Indigenous people.

The 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as the 27th Conference of the Parties (COP27) of the UNFCCC, is underway in Sharm El-Sheik, Egypt.

The conference opened on a grim note from global leaders: the target of keeping global warming below 1.5 C is likely impossible. The stark message, echoed by the heads of various nations, set an urgent tone as governments began two weeks of talks in the seaside resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh to figure out how to avert the worst of climate change.

Daniel T'seleie, who is with the Keepers of Water, and Indigenous Climate Action, both Indigenous-led organisation focusing on climate change action, said climate change solutions on the agenda for COP27, like carbon trading, don't address what really needs to be done.

""The only way to stop climate change,"" he said, ""is to stop the extraction and use of fossil fuels. If that's not the flagship then we're not going to stop the climate crisis.""

T'seleie, who is K'ahsho Got'ine Dene from Fort Good Hope, N.W.T., said solutions to climate change need to address the injustice the people most affected by climate change are living with.

""There's been a real push to make sure that communities that are suffering from climate change, have direct access to funding to deal with things like climate change adaptation,"" he said.

He said in the context of Indigenous peoples back home, that looks like ""land back.""

""We exist in, in a world where nations like Canada are founded on Indigenous lands that was never given up fairly,"" he said.

""And, I think addressing that has to be part of the broader suite of solutions, that is going to stop not just the climate crisis, but all kinds of environmental catastrophe.""

Though he hasn't made it to the conference yet for health reasons, he said he wanted to go in order to raise the profile of other solutions with what he calls ""spectacles"" like flash mobs, outside the conference, though he didn't go into detail on what or whether he had anything planned.

He said it's about getting the message out to the public and the negotiators.

""There's a long history of Indigenous peoples being excluded from UN spaces, not just this climate change space. And there's been a lot of work put in by Indigenous peoples from around the world over the last 20 years, to really carve out some space,"" he said.

""I think for myself, and a lot of the people that I work with at these forums, our goal is to take power back."""
fd661d0b-a9b7-45d0-b1c3-3a07f1224072,"There’s a lot at stake over the next fortnight as nations gather at the COP27 climate conference in Egypt. But the stakes are perhaps highest for the Pacific islands and their people.

A report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change last year said global warming above 1.5℃ would be “catastrophic” for Pacific island nations. Sea-level rise could lead to the loss of entire Pacific countries this century.

Such damage is a fundamental threat to the human rights of Pacific populations who, as one research paper reminds us, are not merely “victims” of climate change, but “real people with dignity and dreams for the future”.

We have been conducting research for the Vanuatu government into how climate change is affecting the human rights of the nation’s highly exposed population. We’ve heard stories of loss and resilience from those whose lives and traditions are being ripped apart by this global catastrophe.

Facing climate change on an island nation

Vanuatu has a population of about 315,000 people, who live across 13 principal and many smaller islands.

Like other Pacific island nations, Vanuatu is highly exposed to climate change effects such as sea-level rise, coral bleaching and extreme tropical cyclones. In fact, the sea level around Vanuatu has risen by around 6mm per year since 1993, a rate nearly twice the global average

Vanuatu is seeking an “advisory opinion” from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to clarify the rights and obligations of states under international law in relation to harms from climate change. A majority of UN member states must agree to this opinion being provided. If Vanuatu succeeds, it could have extensive legal implications at a global, regional and national level.

We undertook research for the Vanuatu government as part of this legal push. It involved a nation-wide survey to explore how locals in Vanuatu experience climate change and how it impinges on their human rights.

‘This is a cultural right’

The study involved an online survey administered in Vanuatu’s national language, Bislama, as well as English and French. Some 118 people completed the survey between June and October this year. The results have been finalised and submitted to the Vanuatu government for use at COP27.

Participants ranged in age from 18 to 76. They told of witnessing general climate change impacts such as intense cyclones, droughts, flooding and coastal inundation.

They also told of decimation and loss of Indigenous knowledge around weather, seasons and medicines, as well as physical damage to traditional crops.

One crop of particular concern was the yam – a starchy, edible root central to the identity of many people native to Vanuatu.

Locals mark the yam harvest with rituals and ceremonies. However, climate change is disrupting these cultural rhythms. As one participant told us, altered weather patterns had led to failed germination, a higher prevalence of disease and root rot, and lower yields:

The cultural ways of planting are not adaptive to these fast changes caused by the climate which is now leading to a loss of cultural practices and knowledge. This is a cultural right that can never be recovered and re-built if we lose it due to climate change. No financial means can recover those non-economic losses, which are our heritage and dignity. And climate change is taking these rights away from us.

Traditional medicines are similarly being lost at an alarming rate and are impinging on the health and wellbeing of local people.

One participant told how children learnt from an early age to be self-sufficient – growing their own food, fishing on the reef and collecting crabs after school. The participant went on:

Nowadays because the coral reefs are dying, the fish have gone […] Our crops are producing less yield because of weather changes. Root crops are rotting before they become ready to harvest because of the unusually large amounts of rain that we experience. We have had to spend more money on food now than we ever did in the past. In the future I do not expect for there to be anything left in the waters or in the bush.

The participant expressed fears that knowledge passed on by grandparents to younger generations about natural resource management would “die with my generation”:

I am concerned about the impacts of climate change on our environment and on our culture. […] the love and respect we had towards nature will fade away into nothing and the deep cultural ties to our waters will be lost when we will have to start teaching our children their heritage from books and not from taking them out to sea on a canoe and pointing out fish like it was done for us.

What this means for COP27

The stories we gathered during our research make one thing clear: climate change is real, it’s impinging on the human rights of people in Vanuatu, and will continue to do so in future.

Among the big issues to be discussed at this year’s COP27 conference is “loss and damage” compensation. This refers to the money that richer nations should pay to developing nations for the economic, socio-cultural, environmental and physical costs brought by climate change.

As our research shows, those costs are already being borne. Developed nations have a moral obligation to make sure people in developing countries, who’ve contributed so little to climate change, do not continue to suffer in a warming world. That includes providing access to appropriate remedies and ways to adapt.

The authors would like to acknowledge and thank Stephanie Stephens, George Koran and Willy Missack from the Vanuatu Climate Action Network for their support and collaboration on this research.

a008f5c8-22b2-40db-a212-531c3c5aa04a,"Small island states are losing their patience with big polluting nations as they suffer the devastating impacts of climate change. Without significant movement at the forthcoming COP27 climate talks in Egypt, a pivotal vote at the next UN general assembly meeting, brought by the tiny Pacific islands of Vanuatu, could open the floodgates to international climate litigation.

A core group of 16 states led by Vanuatu, will table a draft resolution at the general assembly in December requesting that the International Court of Justice (ICJ) gives an “advisory opinion” to clarify the rights and obligations of states under international law in relation to the adverse effects of climate change.

Vanuatu needs only a simple majority of members present and voting (50% plus one), and support is growing. If successful, the baton passes to the ICJ to bring legal clarity to this complex issue.

The advisory opinion would be non-binding. Nonetheless, such an opinion draws enormous moral power and legal authority. Although the vote takes place after COP27, Vanuatu’s initiative could have an influence on negotiations in Egypt.

Responsibility and compensation for loss and damage

Low-income island states like Vanuatu have contributed the least to climate change, but as a group are the most directly affected by it. For low-lying atolls in particular, sea-level rise poses an existential threat – some Pacific nations will be entirely underwater by the end of the century. So it’s not surprising to see states seeking clarity from the ICJ. Vanuatu has taken the lead in going to international courts, but others could follow suit.

As far back as 1991, the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) first called for a mechanism to compensate countries affected by sea level rise. These days, there are calls for “loss and damage” payments to address impacts associated with climate change that cannot be adapted to.

But repeated attempts to raise the profile of loss and damage within the negotiations have been met with hostility from rich countries. At COP26 in Glasgow last year, AOSIS, supported by a coalition of 134 developing countries and China, called for a new facility to finance loss and damage, but this was firmly blocked by the US and EU.

The costs of responding to climate disasters in developing countries could be in the trillions of dollars by 2050, and rich countries will want to avoid any legally binding commitment to meet these costs with public resources. But an ICJ advisory opinion could help unstick negotiations, as the threat of expansive litigation in the future may encourage the rich countries to capitulate.

Diverging interests

All of this plays into the increasingly contentious geopolitics between developing island states and larger, richer nations. A simple divide between rich and poor, north and south, or in the lingo of climate policy “Annex I” and “non-Annex I” countries does not tell the whole story.

For instance many middle income “emerging” countries are rapidly industrialising. Their fast-growing emissions are causing their interests to diverge from those of small island states, and it is unclear whether the large group of developing countries will remain united in loss and damage negotiations.

Recognising the power of small states

Vanuatu’s initiative acknowledges the failures of the climate change negotiations but exemplifies the unique ways that small island developing states can exercise power.

First, the recognition by the country’s president that the ICJ is “the only principal organ of the UN system that has not yet been given an opportunity to help address the climate crisis” is extremely insightful. This seemingly banal observation about a process with no legal force, actually carries huge political significance because, if given the opportunity, the ICJ could make a judgement that powerful polluting countries would rather not have to hear.

Second, Vanuatu’s initiative is triggered by the low level of ambition under current nationally determined contributions (the amount each country pledges to cut its emissions by). International law requires states to prevent harm to the environment and protect human rights. At best, these obligations are not being met; at worst, they are actively being undermined by the lack of transformative climate action being demanded by vulnerable states.

Third, this initiative is being spearheaded by a country of just 300,000 people across 83 islands and atolls, many of which are literally going under water. This is a remarkable example of the kind of leverage that can be exercised by small and vulnerable states. In the absence of conventional sources of power (size and military might) island states have been able to build multilateral coalitions and leverage institutional forms of influence (such as their UN membership, international law, and moral persuasion) to redress the imbalance.

Powerful nations should stand up and take notice. Vanuatu and its partners are pursuing a ground-breaking diplomatic strategy and others will likely follow.

But regardless of the ICJ initiative outcome, any acknowledged responsibility for loss and damage caused by climate change will only have meaningful effects when countries redress them. For the sake of the smallest, most vulnerable nations on earth, it’s high time that they did."
ef6a410b-c2d1-4485-83ba-e674f7e991af,"The world should confront climate change the way it does nuclear weapons, by agreeing to a non-proliferation treaty that stops further production of fossil fuels, a small island nation leader urged Tuesday.

The proposal by Tuvalu came as vulnerable nations pushed for more action and money at international climate talks in Egypt, while big polluters remained divided over who should pay for the damage industrial greenhouse gas emissions have done to the planet.

“We all know that the leading cause of climate crisis is fossil fuels,” Tuvalu Prime Minister Kausea Natano told his fellow leaders.

The Pacific country has “joined Vanuatu and other nations calling for a fossil fuels non-proliferation treaty,” Natano said. “It’s getting too hot and there is very (little) time to slow and reverse the increasing temperature. Therefore, it is essential to prioritize fast-acting strategies.”

Vanuatu and Tuvalu, along with other vulnerable nations, have been flexing their moral authority against the backdrop of recent climate-related disasters. The idea of a non-proliferation treaty for coal, oil and natural gas has previously been advanced by campaigners, religious authorities including the Vatican, and some scientists, but Natano’s speech gave it a boost in front of a global audience.

A year ago at climate talks in Glasgow, a proposal to call for a “phase out” of coal — the dirtiest of the fossil fuels — was changed at the last minute to “phase down” by a demand from India, earning the wrath of vulnerable countries.

Since then the global energy crunch triggered by the Russian invasion of Ukraine has prompted a scramble by some countries and companies seeking to tap fresh gas and oil sources.

Pushing back against that, vulnerable nations also called for a global tax on the profits of fossil fuel corporations that are making billions of dollars daily from sky-high energy prices.

“It is about time that these companies are made to pay a global carbon tax on their profits as a source of funding for loss and damage,” said Gaston Browne, prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda. “Profligate producers of fossil fuels have benefited from extortionate profits at the expense of human civilization.”

The idea of a windfall tax on carbon profits has gained traction in recent months amid sky-high earnings for oil and gas corporations even as consumers struggle to pay for heating their homes and filling their cars. For the first time, U.N. climate conference delegates are to discuss demands by developing nations that the richest, most polluting countries pay compensation for damage wreaked on them by climate change, which in climate negotiations is called “loss and damage.”

Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley said fossil fuel companies should contribute to those funds, which would provide vulnerable countries with financial aid for the climate-related losses they are suffering.

Other leaders rejected the idea.

“I think this is not the place now to develop tax rules, but rather to jointly develop measures to protect against the consequences of climate change,” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz told reporters.

If the small islands can’t get a global tax on fossil fuel profits, Antigua’s Browne suggested going to international courts to get polluters to pay. Scientists from Dartmouth College calculated specific damages for all the world’s countries and how much was caused by other nations, saying it would work well in international court cases.

Browne quoted William Shakespeare’s “Macbeth” in sharing his frustration with lack of action.

“Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow creeps in this petty pace from day to day to the last syllable of recorded time. And all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death,” Browne said.

Despite 27 climate summits “tomorrow has not come,” he said.

Speaking for a country that has suffered from the consequences of climate change recently, Somalia’s president said it faces “one of the worst droughts in modern history.”

President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud said more than 7 million Somalis, or about half the population, cannot meet their basic food needs as the Horn of Africa region has seen two years of failed rains.

“We are trying desperately to respond,” he said. The drought has killed thousands of people, many of them children. It is also reshaping Somalia’s landscape as the country struggles with one of the world’s fastest urbanization rates as many people flee parched areas.

Pakistani Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif told fellow leaders how his country was struck by catastrophic floods in recent months that affected 33 million people and caused more than $30 billion in economic damage.

“This all happened despite our very low carbon footprints,” Sharif said, insisting: “Of course it was a manmade disaster.”

Sharif called for additional financial support for his country and others suffering from the effects of climate change, saying money to help Pakistan rebuild after the floods should be on top of other aid and not come in the form of loans. Further debts, he said “would be a financial death trap.”

The president of Malawi, meanwhile, praised those leaders present in Egypt for simply showing up.

“The temptation to abstain from COP this year was great,” President Lazarus Chakwera said, referring to the talks by their U.N. acronym, “because of the great and unprecedented economic hardships your citizens are suffering.”

“But you resisted this temptation and chose the path of courage,” he said.

Chakwerea said any agreements forged at the two-week meeting should recognize the different abilities of countries such as the United States and China, and developing nations like his own.

There is growing pressure on Beijing to step up its climate efforts given its massive economic clout.

So far, the world’s biggest polluter has insisted that it cannot be held to the same standards as developed economies like the United States or Europe because it is still lifting millions of its citizens out of poverty.

Beijing’s climate envoy said Tuesday that the meeting in Egypt should focus on “implementation” of existing pledges.

“The developed countries will take the lead in effectively scaling up their emission reduction targets and achieving carbon neutrality ahead of time,” Xie Zhenhua said, according to an official translation of the speech.

Xie said it was up to developed countries to “achieve substantive results” on measures for adapting to climate change and financial aid for the poor that are “of greatest concern to developing countries.”

The U.S. mid-term elections were hanging over the talks, with many environmental campaigners worried that defeat for the Democrats could make it harder for President Joe Biden to pursue his ambitious climate agenda.

Also hanging over the conference was the fate of one of Egypt’s most prominent jailed pro-democracy activists, Alaa Abdel-Fattah, who has been imprisoned for most of the past decade. He stopped even drinking water Sunday, the first day of the conference, vowing he is willing to die if not released, his family said.

Numerous world leaders raised his case in meetings with Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, and the head of the U.N. human rights office called for his immediate release.

Egypt’s longtime history of suppressing dissent has raised controversy over its hosting the annual conference, with many climate activists complaining that restrictions by the host are quieting civil society.

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt — The world should confront climate change the way it does nuclear weapons, by agreeing to a non-proliferation treaty that stops further production of fossil fuels, a small island nation leader proposed Tuesday as vulnerable nations pushed for more action and money at international climate talks.

“We all know that the leading cause of climate crisis is fossil fuels,” Tuvalu Prime Minister Kausea Natano told his fellow leaders. So his country has “joined Vanuatu and other nations calling for a fossil fuels non-proliferation treaty... It’s getting too hot and there is very (little) time to slow and reverse the increasing temperature. Therefore, it is essential to prioritize fast acting strategies that avoids the most warming.”

Vanuatu and Tuvalu, along with other vulnerable nations, have been flexing their moral authority in negotiations, especially in light of mega climate disasters. The idea of a non-proliferation treaty for coal, oil and natural gas has been advanced by churches, including the Vatican, and some scientists, but Natano's speech gives it a bigger boost in front of a global audience.

A year ago at climate talks in Glasgow, a proposal to call for a “phase out” coal — the dirtiest of the fossil fuels — was changed at the last minute to “phase down” by a demand from India, earning the wrath of small island nations and some vulnerable countries.

Small island nation leaders also called for a global tax on the profits of fossil fuel corporations that are making billions of dollars of profit a day during a global energy crisis triggered by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

“While they are profiting the planet is burning,” said Gaston Browne, prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda, speaking on behalf of his and other small island nations.

Zimbabwe President Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa called on similar nations to form a “countermanding bloc of the victims of climate change.’’

In a departure from the criticism that rich countries have so far endured from many developing nations’ leaders at this year’s international climate meeting, the president of Malawi praised leaders present in Egypt for simply showing up.

“The temptation to abstain from COP this year was great,” President Lazarus Chakwera said, referring to the talks by their U.N. acronym, ""because of the great and unprecedented economic hardships your citizens are suffering in your own nation,” he said. “But you resisted this temptation and chose the path of courage.”

Chakwerea said any agreements forged at the two-week meeting in Sharm el-Sheikh should recognize the different abilities of developed like the United States and high-productivity countries such as China on the one hand, and developing nations like his own on the other.

So far, China has insisted that it cannot be held to the same standards as developed economies such as the United States or Europe because it is still lifting millions of its citizens out of poverty. But there is growing pressure on Beijing to step up its climate efforts given its massive economic clout.

Jochen Flasbarth, a senior German official and veteran climate negotiator, said China only formally meets the criteria of a developing country.

“In truth it is the top emitter worldwide and it is also an extremely prosperous economy,” he said. ""That’s why we expect, and this is also being done in some areas, that more responsibility is taken on (by China), nationally and internationally.”

Meanwhile, Guterres and leaders such as Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley said it was time to make fossil fuel companies contribute to funds which would provide vulnerable countries with financial aid for the climate-related losses they are suffering.

“It is about time that these companies are made to pay a global carbon tax on their profits as a source of funding for loss and damage,” Antigua's Browne said. “Profligate producers of fossil fuels have benefited from extortionate profits at the expense of human civilization.”

And if the small islands can’t get a global tax on fossil fuel profits, Browne suggested going to international courts to get polluters to pay for what they’ve done. A group of scientists from Dartmouth College calculated specific damages for all the world’s countries and how much was caused by other nations, saying it would work well in international court cases.

Browne also quoted William Shakespeare’s ‘Macbeth’ in sharing his frustration with lack of action.

“Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow creeps in this petty pace from day to day to the last syllable of recorded time. And all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death,” Browne said. Despite 27 climate summits “tomorrow has not come. Governments and corporations come to the COP each year delivering grand statements with lofty commitments. But these commitments are only partially honored.”

The idea of a windfall tax on carbon profits has gained traction in recent months amid sky-high earnings for oil and gas majors even as consumers struggle to pay the cost of heating their homes and filling their cars. For the first time, delegates at this year’s U.N. climate conference are to discuss demands by developing nations that the richest, most polluting countries pay compensation for damage wreaked on them by climate change, which in climate negotiations is called “loss and damage.”

The U.S. mid-term elections were hanging over the talks Tuesday, with many environmental campaigners worried that defeat for the Democrats could make it harder for President Joe Biden to pursue his ambitious climate agenda.

Germany climate envoy Jennifer Morgan said the Biden administration’s recent climate law had given the United States “a higher level of standing” internationally.

Asked about the possible impact of the U.S. midterm election on the talks, Morgan said that individual votes “can’t change the fact that we’re in a climate emergency.”

Also hanging over the conference was the fate of one of Egypt’s most prominent jailed pro-democracy activists, Alaa Abdel-Fattah, who has been imprisoned for most of the past decade. His family stepped up pleas for world leaders to win his release after he stepped up a longtime hunger strike. Abdel-Fattah stopped even drinking water on Sunday, the first day of the conference, vowing he is willing to die if not released, his family says.

The head of the U.N. human rights office called Tuesday for the immediate release of Abdel-Fattah amid concerns about his health.

Volker Türk, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, said the activist, Alaa Abdel-Fattah, “is in great danger. His dry hunger strike puts his life at acute risk.”

Rights office spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani relayed Türk’s comments at a U.N. briefing on Tuesday and said that all activists and others affected by climate change should “have a seat at the table” at the U.N. climate conference that opened a day earlier in the Egyptian seaside resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh.

Egypt’s longtime history of suppressing dissent has raised controversy over its hosting of the annual conference, known as COP 27, with many international climate activists complaining that restrictions by the host are quieting civil society.

On Tuesday, more world leaders were to take the stage, including Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif of Pakistan, where summer floods caused at least $40 billion in damage and displaced millions of people. After the speeches, the conference delegates will delve into negotiations on a range of issues — including for the first time on compensation, known as loss and damage.

Some of the strongest pleas for action came so far from leaders of poor nations that caused little of the pollution but often get a larger share of the weather-related damage."

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt (AP) — The world should confront climate change the way it does nuclear weapons, by agreeing to a non-proliferation treaty that stops further production of fossil fuels, a small island nation leader urged Tuesday.

The proposal by Tuvalu came as vulnerable nations pushed for more action and money at international climate talks in Egypt, while big polluters remained divided over who should pay for the damage industrial greenhouse gas emissions have done to the planet.

“We all know that the leading cause of climate crisis is fossil fuels,” Tuvalu Prime Minister Kausea Natano told his fellow leaders.

The Pacific country has “joined Vanuatu and other nations calling for a fossil fuels non-proliferation treaty,"" Natano said. ""It’s getting too hot and there is very (little) time to slow and reverse the increasing temperature. Therefore, it is essential to prioritize fast-acting strategies.”

Vanuatu and Tuvalu, along with other vulnerable nations, have been flexing their moral authority against the backdrop of recent climate-related disasters. The idea of a non-proliferation treaty for coal, oil and natural gas has previously been advanced by campaigners, religious authorities including the Vatican, and some scientists, but Natano's speech gave it a boost in front of a global audience.

A year ago at climate talks in Glasgow, a proposal to call for a “phase out” of coal — the dirtiest of the fossil fuels — was changed at the last minute to “phase down” by a demand from India, earning the wrath of vulnerable countries.

Since then the global energy crunch triggered by the Russian invasion of Ukraine has prompted a scramble by some countries and companies seeking to tap fresh gas and oil sources.

Pushing back against that, vulnerable nations also called for a global tax on the profits of fossil fuel corporations that are making billions of dollars daily from sky-high energy prices.

“It is about time that these companies are made to pay a global carbon tax on their profits as a source of funding for loss and damage,” said Gaston Browne, prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda. “Profligate producers of fossil fuels have benefited from extortionate profits at the expense of human civilization.”

The idea of a windfall tax on carbon profits has gained traction in recent months amid sky-high earnings for oil and gas corporations even as consumers struggle to pay for heating their homes and filling their cars. For the first time, U.N. climate conference delegates are to discuss demands by developing nations that the richest, most polluting countries pay compensation for damage wreaked on them by climate change, which in climate negotiations is called “loss and damage.”

Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley said fossil fuel companies should contribute to those funds, which would provide vulnerable countries with financial aid for the climate-related losses they are suffering.

Other leaders rejected the idea.

“I think this is not the place now to develop tax rules, but rather to jointly develop measures to protect against the consequences of climate change,” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz told reporters.

If the small islands can’t get a global tax on fossil fuel profits, Antigua's Browne suggested going to international courts to get polluters to pay. Scientists from Dartmouth College calculated specific damages for all the world’s countries and how much was caused by other nations, saying it would work well in international court cases.

Browne quoted William Shakespeare’s “Macbeth” in sharing his frustration with lack of action.

“Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow creeps in this petty pace from day to day to the last syllable of recorded time. And all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death,” Browne said.

Despite 27 climate summits “tomorrow has not come,"" he said.

Speaking for a country that has suffered from the consequences of climate change recently, Somalia’s president said it faces “one of the worst droughts in modern history.”

President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud said more than 7 million Somalis, or about half the population, cannot meet their basic food needs as the Horn of Africa region has seen two years of failed rains.

“We are trying desperately to respond,” he said. The drought has killed thousands of people, many of them children. It is also reshaping Somalia’s landscape as the country struggles with one of the world’s fastest urbanization rates as many people flee parched areas.

Pakistani Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif told fellow leaders how his country was struck by catastrophic floods in recent months that affected 33 million people and caused more than $30 billion in economic damage.

“This all happened despite our very low carbon footprints,” Sharif said, insisting: “Of course it was a manmade disaster.”

Sharif called for additional financial support for his country and others suffering from the effects of climate change, saying money to help Pakistan rebuild after the floods should be on top of other aid and not come in the form of loans. Further debts, he said “would be a financial death trap.”

The president of Malawi, meanwhile, praised those leaders present in Egypt for simply showing up.

“The temptation to abstain from COP this year was great,” President Lazarus Chakwera said, referring to the talks by their U.N. acronym, “because of the great and unprecedented economic hardships your citizens are suffering.”

“But you resisted this temptation and chose the path of courage,” he said.

Chakwerea said any agreements forged at the two-week meeting should recognize the different abilities of countries such as the United States and China, and developing nations like his own.

There is growing pressure on Beijing to step up its climate efforts given its massive economic clout.

So far, the world's biggest polluter has insisted that it cannot be held to the same standards as developed economies like the United States or Europe because it is still lifting millions of its citizens out of poverty.

Beijing's climate envoy said Tuesday that the meeting in Egypt should focus on “implementation” of existing pledges.

""The developed countries will take the lead in effectively scaling up their emission reduction targets and achieving carbon neutrality ahead of time,” Xie Zhenhua said, according to an official translation of the speech.

Xie said it was up to developed countries to “achieve substantive results” on measures for adapting to climate change and financial aid for the poor that are “of greatest concern to developing countries.”

The U.S. mid-term elections were hanging over the talks, with many environmental campaigners worried that defeat for the Democrats could make it harder for President Joe Biden to pursue his ambitious climate agenda.

Also hanging over the conference was the fate of one of Egypt’s most prominent jailed pro-democracy activists, Alaa Abdel-Fattah, who has been imprisoned for most of the past decade.

Numerous world leaders raised his case in meetings with Egypt's President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, and the head of the U.N. human rights office called for his immediate release.

Egypt’s longtime history of suppressing dissent has raised controversy over its hosting the annual conference, with many climate activists complaining that restrictions by the host are quieting civil society.

The list, which began in 1978, has more than 1,150 sites nominated by their host nations and includes tourist destinations like the Great Wall of China, the Great Barrier Reef in Australia and the Central Amazon Conservation Complex in Brazil.

It also features some of the world’s most-famous and most-visited glaciers, including those in Yosemite National Park. But according to a report released by the agency last week, a third of them are expected to disappear by 2050 because of climate change.

The glaciers that are likely to disappear include the last remaining ones in Africa, in Kilimanjaro National Park and on Mount Kenya, those on the Pyrenees’ Mont Perdu, which spans the borders of France and Spain, and in Italy’s Dolomites.

The report, released days before the U.N.’s COP27 climate change conference is set to begin in Egypt, posed a challenge to the travel industry, which is a large contributor to global carbon emissions, with a footprint estimated between 8 and 11 percent of total greenhouse gases, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council, or W.T.T.C. Aviation represents around 17 percent of total travel carbon emissions."
1cf41701-8e1e-4b85-8da7-96ad4da839f2,"BENGALURU, India (AP) — Global average temperatures have risen and weather extremes have already seen an uptick, so the short answer to whether it's too late to stop climate change is: yes. But there's still time to prevent cascading effects, as every degree of additional warming has exponentially disastrous impacts, experts say.

A 2021 report by the top body of climate scientists provided new analysis of the chance the world has to cap warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) or 2 Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times in the coming decades, in line with global climate goals.

Although scientists estimated it's still possible to stay within these limits, they said it would require immediate, rapid and large-scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. It’s more likely that global temperature will reach or exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming, the report said.

The 1.5-degree goal is “on life support,"" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said.

___

EDITOR’S NOTE: This story is part of an ongoing series answering some of the most fundamental questions around climate change, the science behind it, the effects of a warming planet and how the world is addressing it.

Without major action to reduce emissions, the global average temperature is on track to rise by 2.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius (4.5 to 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100, scientists say.

And researchers warn that the situation will get very serious before then: Once the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold is reached, there will be increasing heat waves, longer warm seasons and shorter cold seasons. When the 2 degrees Celsius mark is crossed, critical tolerance levels for agriculture and health will be reached.

But all hope is not lost, they urge.

At the time of the report's release, Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College of London, said achieving the 1.5-degree goal “is still possible from a physical science point of view.""

""If we reduce emissions globally to net zero by 2040 there is still a two thirds chance to reach 1.5 degrees and if we globally achieve net zero emissions by the middle of the century, there is still a one third chance to achieve that,” she said.

If all human emissions of heat-trapping gases were to stop today, Earth’s temperature would continue to rise for a few decades but would eventually stabilize, climate scientists say. If humans don’t emit any additional planet-warming gasses, then natural processes would begin to slowly remove the excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and global temperatures would gradually begin to decline.

“There is a direct relation between delay and warming, and between warming and risk of what we would call extreme impacts,"" said Ajay Gambhir, a senior research fellow at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment, based at Imperial College London. “ Unfortunately, we’re already seeing all these extreme impacts — whether it’s extreme heat waves, increased risk of crop failures, forest fires or bleaching coral reefs— already happening.”

He added: “The further we delay action on addressing climate change by reducing our emissions, the warmer the world will get.”

78b13aba-cd71-41c7-967a-21156c2d42c3,"Can people's individual actions make a difference in how much carbon dioxide is emitted on an international scale?

International organizations such as the United Nations have called on individuals to limit their carbon footprint and live more sustainably, along with governments and corporations.

Some argue it would be more effective to focus on changing government and corporate policy to limit emissions from the energy and agriculture sectors than asking individuals to limit their carbon footprints. Experts say that while that's true, every bit of emissions reduction helps.

""We should all be the most responsible citizens we can be in every sense of the word and contribute to a sustainable existence on this planet,"" said University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann. He said that means, in part, minimizing our carbon footprints as individuals.

And that can take a lot of different forms.

The United Nations Act Now campaign for individual climate action suggests people can minimize their personal carbon footprint directly by changing their energy and transportation use and food consumption.

Other, less direct methods for reducing carbon emissions include divesting from fossil fuel companies in retirement plans, protesting to support climate action and lobbying government officials to pass environmentally sustainable policies.

Meat matters

Elizabeth Robinson, the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment's director, pointed to stopping deforestation and tweaking diets as solutions since forests naturally absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

Using land for agriculture, especially for livestock which also requires vast amounts of land for grazing, means forests need to be cleared and more greenhouse gasses are emitted into the air.

""This is a very controversial area, but in most higher-income countries, most people eat far more meat than they need to,"" Robinson said.

Kim Cobb, a Brown University climate scientist, said there are consequences to individuals having ""outsized"" carbon footprints. And still there are people who engage in the environmental movement who don't consider their personal carbon footprints.

""I think we're living in an anti-gravity moment where people are able to say, 'I'm not concerned about my first, personal carbon footprint. Collective action matters the most,""' she said. In the future, though, ""there will be a moral and social cost to bear by those individuals.""

Cutting fossil fuels is critical

Still, there are some climate impacts that people aren't individually responsible for and can't change on their own. Over 70 per cent of all greenhouse gas emissions produced between 1988 and 2015 came from 100 fossil fuel companies, according a 2017 report by CDP, formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project.

And despite the United Nations' warnings to drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions, countries are planning on extracting double the amount of fossil fuels than what would be consistent with keeping the global temperature rise below 1.5 degrees Celsius, even as they pledge to make ambitious cuts.

In a 2021 report, the International Energy Agency said there can be no new investments in fossil fuels if the world wants to reach its climate goals. The most recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change said ""immediate and deep"" cuts to dirty fuels were needed.

So, although there are things individuals can do to minimize their personal carbon footprints, Mann said, ""we must not allow ... polluters to reframe the discussion so that it falls entirely upon individuals, which takes the pressure off of them.""

""We can't pass legislation ourselves that incentivizes renewable energy or that blocks new fossil fuel infrastructure. We can't impose regulations on industry. We can't negotiate directly with international partners. We need our policymakers to do that,"" Mann said.

""Those things can only be enacted at the systematic level, and that's why we have to keep the pressure on policymakers and on corporations and those who are in a position to make the changes that we can't make ourselves.""

Shift to renewables, green tech needed

The world is currently reliant on fossil fuels for much of its electricity, heating and transportation, as well as agriculture and industry. It's hoped that cleaner alternatives — such as solar and wind energy — will replace much of that demand.

As costs of renewables plummet, more and more energy is being produced in sustainable ways, although the total amount of energy produced globally has also gone up.

""There's been quite a rapid uptake of renewables, but emissions are continuing to rise,"" said Robinson. ""We also need to see overall global emissions falling, and at the moment global emissions from fossil fuels are still increasing.""

While renewable energy sources work well for electricity production, other industries — such as cement-making, steel and shipping — will be harder to wean off dirty fuels. That's why experts are looking into technologies that may be able to help these specific sectors, as well as the possibility of ""green fuels,"" such as those made out of plant materials or natural waste, known as biofuels.

Newer technologies such as green hydrogen, which uses renewable energy sources to make hydrogen to use for energy, and carbon capture, which sucks carbon dioxide out of the air, are also being explored but still come with a heavy price tag and are untested on a large scale.

Methane, a greenhouse gas that is about 25 times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide but only lasts in the atmosphere for about a dozen years, will also have to be greatly reduced. Countries have vowed to plug methane leaks from oil wells and gas pipelines which would have immediate benefits for curbing warming, scientists say.

In addition to limiting climate change, humans will also need to learn how to live with some warming. Looking at how to rein in warming while simultaneously learning to acclimate is known as ""mitigation and adaptation"" in climate circles. Many officials and scientists say both are needed.

""We've got to do everything,"" said Robinson. ""It's too late to say one thing's better than the other."""

The Backyard Stories is a new podcast and written column, in partnership with Protect Our Winters (POW), following athletes and local food advocates who are deeply invested in their home ecosystems - their backyards. Read the introduction here.







As we head into the midterm elections tomorrow, there's a lot at stake.

Through The Backyard Stories we have learned from athletes and farmers about how their home ecosystems, their backyards, are impacted by climate change: wildfire, diminished snowpack, compromised air quality, water access in farming communities, and what it's like raising kids in our new climate reality.

The stories of Stephanie Howe, Kimo Laughlin, Dani Reyes-Acosta, Nick Brown, and Mike Foote are all deeply individual and specific to their regions, but the thread that runs through is that protecting wild and managed places takes action.

Last week, I had a conversation with Mario Molina, Executive Director of Protect Our Winters, about political action. We talked about creating rituals around civic engagement, how across political parties there is mostly agreement on climate issues, and the main ingredient in a representative democracy.

RELATED: Care About the Outdoors? You Need to Vote in the Midterms.

""Most Americans, whether they identify as Democrats, Republicans, or Independents, recognize that the climate is changing and that it is human-caused, agree that something should be done about it, and that there should be government intervention,"" Molina told me from his home office near Boulder, Colorado. What we don't agree, he shares, is where climate issues should be prioritized along with everything else.

""There’s a lot on the ballot. What's important for those whose livelihoods and lifestyles rely on a healthy planet and healthy landscapes is to realize that this election will determine whether we continue on a path that has been laid to transition the country to a renewable energy future.""

Story continues

""Whether it was coral bleaching in the Great Barrier Reef, glacial recession in the Andes, or increased hurricane risk in the Caribbean, I realized that climate was affecting every single natural landscape that I enjoyed recreating in,"" said Molina.

Molina has been working in the climate change arena for the past 12 years. Prior to leading Protect Our Winters, he was the International Director for the Climate Reality Project. He first became involved in energy and climate policy in 2010, when he started noticing a lot of changes in the outdoor places he loves.

""Whether it was coral bleaching in the Great Barrier Reef, glacial recession in the Andes, or increased hurricane risk in the Caribbean, I realized that climate was affecting every single natural landscape that I enjoyed recreating in,"" said Molina.

Running To Vote

I am one of those people who rely directly on a healthy planet and healthy landscapes, not only as a runner, but as a potato farmer (you can find my favorite recipe below.) I came into this sport from the rigor of motherhood and physical labor on our farm. Running was supposed to be a respite. It soon became a competition and, ultimately, a career path.

From my earliest days of ultra distance running, I made sense of the sheer volume of miles with this idea that, one day, the physical endurance would have a tangible purpose. Maybe it would require me to cover vast tracts of land on foot to help someone, or - my favorite daydream - to be a foot messenger, tasked with delivering a message in hostile territory.

Now I see that we are in hostile territory, and I do have a message to deliver.

I have been running to my rural town hall in Vermont, Wisconsin, on election day, ever since 2018. It's about 12 miles out-and-back on rolling country roads, up to the old school house on a windy ridgetop. The message I’m delivering here is for my political representatives, indicating what actions I support, while the hostile territory is today’s political polarization and climate catastrophe.

While running to cast my vote is more symbolic rather than necessary, it still makes me feel more for the event. It has nothing to do with not driving a vehicle. In fact, when I get to town hall, my husband and kids are often already there, pulling up to the building in a car. It has to do with the fact that I can run, and because it is a solitary ritual that adds more purpose to the practice.

""Whenever possible, voting is a family activity,"" Molina told me. ""We go as a family and I let my four year-old cast the ballot. When she was two I put the ballot in her hands and let her slip it in. We will do the same for this election. My goal is to instill engagement from her because she will be casting ballots in every election when she is old enough to vote – then for the rest of her life.""

Building ritual around political action takes the experience from duty to ceremony.

""It’s important to create an atmosphere of celebration around voting. It’s a privilege and it’s a legacy,"" Molina said about the environment he fosters, not only for his family, but as a leader in climate advocacy. ""What we have seen over 200 years of the American experiment is that it can be improved, it can be changed, it can be attacked, it can come under a lot of pressure. Yet it continues to move forward mostly in the way that it was designed to, with its flaws and its challenges and its corruption. But a representative democracy continues to be the system of government we have seen work.""

The window of time to save ourselves from a bleak climate reality is narrowing. The largest lever we can pull is that of the political system. Molina believes deeply in the democratic process, but it needs to be fully utilized for it to work, ""It was designed to withstand a lot of pressures, intentionally. But the one pressure [a representative democracy] can't withstand, and will not withstand, is a lack of participation. The very cornerstone of democracy is participation.""

Tomorrow, I will run up to my town hall, ready to deliver my message. Along the way I will pass my rural neighbors who are also on their way to vote. While I have no influence on how they vote or what issues they prioritize, I will be witnessing a representative democracy in action, on foot, at ground level.

b9c02a8c-bd0b-47b4-8855-ad58c224a5e3,"It seems that every election season, we hear more and more from politicians and pundits about how important it is for campaigns to talk about “kitchen table issues.” A political shorthand for the things average people care about day to day, the term “kitchen table issues” typically refers to economic issues like jobs, taxes and, right now, inflation.

Every year, millions of college students reconvene with their families at the Thanksgiving table to talk and argue about turkey, football and, yes, politics. In the name of familial harmony, controversial political issues are generally not a good topic for Thanksgiving dinner. Or so they say. But climate change is different: there’s a way to explain to even the most conservative relatives that addressing this issue will make their lives better, not in 50 years, but now. The climate conversation in America today exists in a kind of limbo; multiple polls show between 65% and 70% of Americans are concerned about climate change, yet fewer than 50% think it will affect them personally.

In other words, for many Americans, climate change is something that happens to other people, in other places, sometimes now, maybe more in the future. Contrast this sentiment with the quintessential kitchen table issues, such as gas prices, which you see on big signs every day and in your bank statement every month, and you start to see the problem.

The reason kitchen table issues hold so much weight in political circles, especially around election season, is that they have dramatic impacts on people’s decisions at the ballot box. Additionally, the reason these conversations happen at the kitchen table is because people see the impacts and importance of them on a daily basis, unlike climate change for many.

Consistently, the issue that Americans care most about is the economy (climate change doesn’t even crack the top 10), and you can pretty much track presidential approval ratings with gas prices for the last 50 years.

But that can change, quickly. In July of this year, the Supreme Court overturned 50 years of federally protected abortion access, and abortion suddenly became a kitchen-table issue. When Americans were asked about the most important issues facing the nation, abortion access ranked fourth, behind only inflation, the economy and the government, and ahead of immigration, racism and unity.

So why hasn’t climate change had its “kitchen table breakthrough?”

You could point to the millions of dollars spent by the oil industry trying to discredit climate science (and scientists), the decades of American presidents and politicians who refused to even acknowledge the issue or the fact that many people are more worried about feeding their kids tomorrow than feeding the world in 50 years. And you’d be right.

But none of us are going to solve these issues at the dinner table this Thanksgiving. What we can do is find a new way to talk about climate change, one that centers how the problems and solutions impact all of us and our day-to-day lives. And the best way I’ve found to do that is by talking about economics. Not abstract economics, not things like a commercial buildings energy efficient investment tax credit bill, a provision of the Inflation Reduction Act, but tangible, kitchen-table economics.

Climate activists for years have warned that unless we act now, we face global catastrophe in 30 years. These tactics aren’t wrong in principle — climate change is terrifying, and we should all be deeply concerned for the fate of our planet and each other — but this approach alone has clearly fallen short.

What if the reason we’ve failed to motivate the average American is because we’re missing half the argument? Our brains aren’t built to contemplate, internalize and act on existential threats to human civilization.

Proselytizers and evangelicals have understood this for centuries. Sure, you can always motivate a small section of the population by preaching damnation and hellfire. But your narrative becomes far more powerful when people believe they can be saved, when you talk about a Promised Land.

We need to show people that climate change isn’t just something to be afraid of. It’s also an opportunity. Who doesn’t want a brand-new set of free (or deeply discounted) electric home appliances?

The federal government is offering discounts ranging from 30% to 100% (based on area and household income) for electric stoves, water and space heaters, clothes dryers, insulation/ventilation, breaker boxes and electrical wiring. The average American household stands to save $1,800 a year by upgrading. Who wouldn’t want a 30% discount on a home solar energy system that could keep the lights on in a storm and slash (or potentially eliminate) their electric bill?

After Hurricane Ian, a small Florida community grabbed headlines as the some of the only people in the area with power following the storm, due largely to their investment in solar energy and community storage.

If these home incentives aren’t enough, what about $7,500 off a new F-150 that can tow over 9,000 pounds, power your house for a week and goes zero to 60 faster than a Camaro (oh, and takes gas prices off the kitchen table for good)?

And, for your uncle who complains every year about how “we used to build things here:”

Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, along with being the single largest climate intervention in history, also stands to create more than a million domestic manufacturing and assembly jobs by 2030, building all those things we talked about above and more. Those are good union jobs, the kind that offer a middle-class life for people without college degrees — the kind of jobs that have mostly vanished in the U.S. since the 1980s — the kind that conservatives love to promote. In this moment, especially if you have relatives worried about gas prices, inflation or finding a good job, it may also be helpful to talk about what they stand to gain from progressive climate policies.

You might even have a great Thanksgiving dinner.

He says a more ambitious US climate policy would require a larger congressional majority that supports aggressive action — a scenario that depends in part on whether voters turn out in the midterm elections to vote for climate champions and against deniers and delayers.

We'll also discuss the climate agenda at the two-week UN climate summit in Egypt.

We've helped 500,000+ climate-first voters vote in their very first midterm so far and—watch out—we're just getting started. We're gonna flood the polls tomorrow!https://t.co/70VHuzBPDe #ClimateAction — Nathaniel Stinnett (@NCStinn) November 7, 2022

In that regard, there’s definitely still more work to be done. “The simple truth is the climate movement needs more political power, period,” Stinnett told LX News. “But if we get it—and all of our research at the Environmental Voter Project shows that the numbers are there for us to get it if we just start showing up and voting in all these elections—well then, yeah, we will be an unstoppable political force.”

The New Republic digs into the polling numbers behind public sentiment on climate change and whether that truly is a widespread driver for voting. As polling has shown and the Environmental Voter Project has proven, it certainly can be. But in terms of messaging, climate stays sidelined by economic concerns among many other issues. The New Republic suggests groups make more concerted efforts on state- and region-specific elections, framing climate concerns as something just as immediate as inflation—because it absolutely is.

Oregon congressional hopeful Jamie McLeoud-Skinner offers a perfect example of what that looks like in the state she’s vying to represent. “Wildfire does not check party affiliation when it’s burning down homes. So this is an issue everyone’s concerned about,” McLeod-Skinner told the New Republic. “I’ve met folks who hate Obamacare but love the ACA. And it’s that same thing with climate. There are people who don’t really talk about it as climate change—they see that as a buzzword... But if you talk about wildfire, and flooding, and drought, that has impacted our families across Oregon.”

These are lessons that, regardless of the midterms’ outcome, can continue to resonate in elections to come.

At long last, the 2022 midterms are almost here! With the battle for the House front and center, we give you a window into the key races on a final pre-election episode of The Downballot. We discuss a wide range of contests that will offer insight into how the night is going, including top GOP pickup opportunities, second-tier Republican targets, and the seats where Democrats are on offense. And with many vote tallies likely to stretch on for some time, we also identify several bellwether races in states that count quickly."
eca75427-273b-4250-bb05-a9a9b48e464b,"The impacts of climate change threaten “the things Americans value most,” according to the latest version of the federal interagency National Climate Assessment (NCA).

The latest NCA, the first since 2018, warns that “more intense extreme events and long-term climate changes make it harder to maintain safe homes and healthy families, reliable public services, a sustainable economy, thriving ecosystems, and strong communities.”

The report adds that many of those extreme impacts are already reality and poised to worsen in parts of the country. For example, parts of the country have seen intensified rainfall and flooding in regions like the Northeast and the Midwest, according to the NCA. These phenomena have consequences beyond immediate damages, the report notes — they can also result in runoff that damages crops and water supplies.

For example, between 1981 and 2016, excess precipitation cost the U.S. about as much in maize crop yields as extreme drought would have.

Droughts, meanwhile, have caused nearly $300 billion in damages over the last four decades, and their impact is likely to intensify in the future, particularly in the Southwest, which has already seen a drought lasting most of this century.

Another emerging threat is that of so-called compound events, or multiple extreme weather events that hit a single area consecutively or concurrently. These events strain local supply chains and emergency services, as well as causing side effects like mass die-offs of wildlife that can be a major local food source.

One such example is the record temperatures in California and the Pacific Northwest in 2020, which led to a particularly destructive fire season across the region. The regional drought extended into the next year and, combined with another heat wave and worse-than-average snow season, caused more than $36 billion in damages, according to the report.

The impact of climate change also exacerbates, and will exacerbate, existing social inequalities. Historical discrimination patterns mean minority neighborhoods are more likely to be in low-lying, flood-prone areas and those vulnerable to industrial pollution. They also have fewer trees and more pavement, creating so-called heat islands that make them more susceptible to extreme heat — in some cases, up to 12.6 degrees Fahrenheit than richer, whiter neighborhoods during heatwaves.

The latest NCA comes during the COP27 United Nations climate summit in Egypt, where global inequalities around the impact of climate change is a major theme as well. International “loss and damages” funding for those nations facing its worst impacts made the conference agenda for the first time this year.

First, the good news: The amount of planet-warming gases Californians released into the atmosphere in 2020 was 9% less than the previous year — a record decline mostly because of motorists driving less amid the COVID-19 lockdown.

Now, the bad news: The quantity of carbon dioxide spewed by record-setting wildfires that same year effectively erased almost two decades of emission reductions on the part of the world's fifth — and soon to be fourth — largest economy.

Those two findings — both released in a little more than a week's time this month — have painted a grim and confusing portrait of California's efforts to curb global warming. They also come as a U.N. report finds that global greenhouse gas reduction efforts are ""highly inadequate.""

Word that Californians had effectively reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 35 million metric tons in 2020 — the equivalent of 94 coal plants operating for a year — was announced last week as a part of the California Air Resources Board's annual greenhouse gas emission inventory.

The inventory, however, did not account for the roughly 127 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent that were released by the state's 2020 wildfires. That piece of the equation was announced earlier this month by UCLA researchers. They found that wildfires were second only to transportation as the state’s primary source of planet-warming gases in 2020, ahead of industry and electrical power generation.

Asked why their inventory did not include that information as well, CARB said it was designed to estimate heat-trapping gases produced from all sectors of the state economy, including industrial transportation, electricity, agriculture, commercial and residential sectors.

""We do track wildfire emissions on an annual basis, but they are not part of the GHG Inventory ... which tracks emissions from fossil fuels and high-global warming potential gases such as methane and HFC refrigerants,"" said CARB spokesperson David Clegern.

Story continues

They said the agency did include wildfires when it calculated its draft 2022 Scoping Plan, which urges state and federal authorities to drastically increase the thinning and treatment of forests that have become dangerously overgrown with flammable vegetation.

""We are working with other state agencies on ways to stabilize forests and return them to sustainability as carbon sinks. In the meantime, it is essential that we work even harder to reduce fossil fuel emissions as it is clear that they are driving the overall problem and we have the means to make those reductions now,"" Clegern said.

Since it started in 2000, the annual estimate of statewide greenhouse gas emissions has been viewed as an important metric in tracking the state’s progress toward its climate goals. However, state officials said 2020 was an anomalous year, and that they expected to see an increase when they calculated the 2021 inventory.

In 2020, the transportation sector accounted for the largest decline in emissions, with 27 million metric tons fewer carbon emissions, or about 16% less, compared with 2019. This was largely from fewer cars being on the road during the shelter-in-place orders.

In April 2020, California motorists drove 44% fewer miles than in April 2019. Miles driven have since rebounded to pre-pandemic levels, state officials said. Heavy-duty truck mileage also dropped 13% in April 2020 compared with the same month the year prior, but later surpassed 2019 levels as consumer demand grew during the shutdown.

“This year will be looked at as an outlier and cannot be used as a reliable data point to predict trends for the years to come,” said Steven Cliff, executive officer at CARB. “It also made clear however, that as we build back we must continue with the actions that we know will reduce greenhouse gases and clean the air and our hardest hit communities, including deployment of renewable energy and zero emission cars and trucks on our roadways and highways.”

Danny Cullenward, policy director of CarbonPlan, a California nonprofit that analyzes climate solutions, said he agreed that there was not much to be gleaned from the 2020 numbers.

""The whole issue is what happens after the pandemic year, and that's not something this inventory speaks to,"" he said. ""If you're wondering, are we on track for our goals? How are things looking? It was an anomalous year. There's nothing surprising in the data released. It was not a very representative year. What matters is what happens as we came out of it.""

The two-year lag in publishing greenhouse gas emissions in California, however, presents an obstacle to an expeditious response, he said.

""It's kind of weird that here we are in October 2022 and we're talking about what happened in 2020,"" Cullenward said.

""The delay contributes to a lack of oversight and reduces the potential for policymakers to update their thinking,"" he said.

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt — Envoys from around the globe gathered Sunday in the Egyptian seaside resort of Sharm el-Sheikh for talks on tackling climate change that come as the world also grapples with multiple crises, including the war in Ukraine, high inflation, food shortages and an energy crunch.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned last week that the planet was heading toward irreversible ""climate chaos"" unless countries find a way to put the world back on track to cut emissions and help poor countries cope with the impacts of global warming.

More than 40,000 participants have been registered for this year's talks, reflecting the sense of urgency as major weather events around the world impact many people and cost billions of dollars in repairs. Egypt said over 120 world leaders will attend, many of them speaking at a high-level event on Nov. 7-8, while U.S. President Joe Biden was expected to arrive later in the week.

But many top figures including China's President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India were not planning to come, casting doubt on whether the talks in Egypt could result in any major deals to cut emissions without two of the world's biggest polluters.

Germany's foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said the talks were being overshadowed by Russia's attack on Ukraine that has triggered political and economic upheaval around the world.

""But 2022 must not become a lost year for climate protection,"" she said in a statement. ""For many states, it's about the survival of their population and their culture. For them, the climate crisis remains the most important security issue, not Russia's war in Europe.""

Baerbock said Germany was willing to show solidarity with poor countries, including on the thorny issue of compensation for losses resulting from climate change caused by rich countries' emissions.

Rights groups criticized Egypt on Sunday for restricting protests and stepping up surveillance during the summit.

New York-based Human Rights Watch, citing Egyptian media, said authorities had also arrested dozens of people for calling for protests.

""It is becoming clear that Egypt's government has no intention of easing its abusive security measures and allowing for free speech and assembly,"" Adam Coogle, the group's deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa, said in a statement.

Human Rights Watch said it had had joined about 1,400 groups from around the world urging Egypt to lift the restrictions on civil society groups.

Alaa Abdel-Fattah, a prominent imprisoned pro-democracy activist, escalated his hunger strike Sunday in the first day of the COP27, according to his family. Abdel-Fattah's aunt, award-winning novelist Ahdaf Soueif, said he went into a ""full hunger strike,"" and stopped drinking water at 10 a.m. local time.

Negotiators spent a frantic two days ahead of the meeting discussing whether to formally consider the issue of loss and damage, or reparations, to vulnerable nations suffering from climate change. The issue, which has weighed on the talks for years, was agreed just hours before the meeting officially opened.

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt — Envoys from around the globe gathered Sunday in the Egyptian seaside resort of Sharm el-Sheikh for talks on tackling climate change amid a multitude of competing crises, including the war in Ukraine, high inflation, food shortages and an energy crunch.

“This is a once in a generation opportunity to save our planet and our livelihoods,” said Hoesung Lee, chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

The outgoing chair of the talks, British official Alok Sharma, said countries had made considerable progress at their last meeting in Glasgow, including on setting more ambitious targets for cutting emissions, finalizing the rules of the 2015 Paris agreement and pledging to begin phasing out the use of coal — the most heavily polluting fossil fuel.

“We kept 1.5 degrees (2.7 Fahrenheit) alive,” he said, referring to the most ambitious goal of the Paris pact, to keep temperature increase since pre-industrial times under that threshold.

Yet now those efforts were being “buffeted by global headwinds,” he warned.

“(Russian President Vladimir) Putin’s brutal and illegal war in Ukraine has precipitated multiple global crisis, energy and food insecurity, inflationary pressures and spiraling debt,” said Sharma. “These crises have compounded existing climate vulnerabilities and the scarring effects of the pandemic.”

However even the most optimistic scenarios assuming countries do everything they have pledged put the world on course for 1.7 C of warming (3.1 F), he warned.

“As challenging as our current moment is, inaction is myopic and can only defer climate catastrophe,” said Sharma. “We must find the ability to focus on more than one thing at once.”

“How many more wake up calls does the world to world leaders actually need,” he said, citing recent devastating floods in Pakistan and Nigeria, and historic droughts in Europe, the United States and China.

His successor, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, said his office would “spare no effort” to achieve the goals of the Paris accord.

President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi wrote on Twitter that Egypt, as host country, was seeking to move from the “pledges phase to the implantation phase with concrete measures on the ground.”

The UN’s top climate official also appealed to countries both to engage constructively in the negotiations and take the necessary action back home.

“Here in Sharm el-Sheikh, we have a duty to speed up our international efforts to turn words into action,” he said, adding that “every corner of human activity must align with our Paris commitment and pursue our efforts to limit temperature rise to 1.5 degrees.”

Alaa Abdel-Fattah, a prominent imprisoned pro-democracy activist from Egypt, escalated his hunger strike Sunday in the first day of the COP27, according to his family. Abdel-Fattah’s aunt, award-winning novelist Ahdaf Soueif, said he went into a “full hunger strike,” and stopped drinking water at 10 a.m. local time. Concerned that he could die without water, she was calling for authorities to release him in response to local and international calls.

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt (AP) — Envoys from around the globe gathered Sunday in the Egyptian seaside resort of Sharm el-Sheikh for talks on tackling climate change amid a multitude of competing crises, including the war in Ukraine, high inflation, food shortages and an energy crunch.

Notching up a first small victory, negotiators agreed after two frantic days of preliminary talks to formally discuss the question of vulnerable nations receiving money for the loss and damage they've suffered from climate change. The issue has weighed on the talks for years, with rich nations including the United States pushing back against the idea of climate reparations.

“The fact that it has been adopted as an agenda item demonstrates progress and parties taking a mature and constructive attitude towards this,"" said the U.N.'s top climate official, Simon Stiell.

“This is a difficult subject area. It’s been floating for thirty plus years,” he said. ""I believe it bodes well.”

The decision was also welcomed by civil society groups.

“At long last, providing funding to address losses and damages from climate impacts is on the agenda of the U.N. climate negotiations,” said Ani Dasgupta, president of the World Resources Institute.

But he cautioned that participants “still have a marathon ahead of us before countries iron out a formal decision on this central issue.”

German climate envoy Jennifer Morgan, who led negotiations on the issue together with Chile in the run-up to the talks, said the agreement could help negotiators also make “serious progress” on the issue of reducing emissions.

The outgoing chair of the talks, British official Alok Sharma, said countries had made considerable progress at their last meeting in Glasgow in keeping alive the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) by the end of the century.

Experts say that chances of meeting that target, agreed in the 2015 Paris climate accord, is fast slipping away though. Already, temperatures around the world have increased by about 1.2 C (2.2 F) since pre-industrial times

Sharma warned that other global crises meant international efforts to curb climate change were being “buffeted by global headwinds.""

“(Russian President Vladimir) Putin’s brutal and illegal war in Ukraine has precipitated multiple global crisis, energy and food insecurity, inflationary pressures and spiraling debt,” said Sharma. “These crises have compounded existing climate vulnerabilities and the scarring effects of the pandemic.”

“As challenging as our current moment is, inaction is myopic and can only defer climate catastrophe,” said Sharma. “We must find the ability to focus on more than one thing at once.”

""How many more wake up calls does the world to world leaders actually need,” he said, citing recent devastating floods in Pakistan and Nigeria, and historic droughts in Europe, the United States and China.

His successor, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, said Egypt would “spare no effort"" to make the meeting in Sharm el-Sheikh a success and achieve the goals of the Paris accord.

In an opening speech, the chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Hoesung Lee, said countries have “a once in a generation opportunity to save our planet and our livelihoods.""

Cutting emissions is only part of the task, however. Scientists and campaigners say the world also needs to do more to adapt to those effects of global warming that can't be avoided anymore.

The head of the U.N. migration agency urged the international community Sunday to mobilize human and financial resources to address growing climate migration.

António Vitorino told The Associated Press that millions of people across the world “are already suffering in their daily lives because of the impacts of natural disasters and climate change.”

“We are running short of time to act,” Vitorino said. “The international community needs to mobilize the expertise, human resources but also the financial resources to come in to support those who are already today seriously impacted by climate change.”

Vitorino, IOM’s director general, said the world needs to double the $100 billion current funding for adaption especially in regions and communities impacted by the fast-changing climate.

“If we don’t focus on solutions for the future,” he said. “We will leave a dramatic humanitarian crisis in the future (that) will eat millions and millions of people in the world,” he said.

More than 40,000 participants have been registered for this year's talks, reflecting the sense of urgency as major weather events around the world impact many people and cost billions of dollars in repairs. Organizers say about 110 world leaders will attend, many of them speaking at a high-level event on Nov. 7-8, while U.S. President Joe Biden was expected to arrive later in the week.

But many top figures including China's President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India were not planning to come, casting doubt on whether the talks in Egypt could result in any major deals to cut emissions without two of the world's biggest polluters.

Rights groups again criticized Egypt for restricting protests and stepping up surveillance during the summit, and highlighted the case of Alaa Abdel-Fattah, a prominent imprisoned pro-democracy activist. Abdel-Fattah’s aunt, award-winning novelist Ahdaf Soueif, said he went into a “full hunger strike” Sunday and stopped drinking water at 10 a.m. local time.

673f151b-2c3e-45be-8705-697c759f0c27,"Payments from high-emitting countries to mitigate the harm that climate change has caused in the most vulnerable parts of the world is finally on the agenda for discussion at a global climate change summit, more than 30 years after the idea was first articulated by delegates from small island developing states.

Loss and damage is the term used by the UN to describe these impacts of climate change that cannot be prevented and to which people cannot adapt. These include lives that have been and will be lost, communities displaced by rising seas, extreme weather and famine, livelihoods and cultural heritage destroyed and ecosystems damaged beyond repair because of a failure to arrest greenhouse gas emissions, and so, global temperature rise.

The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported that approximately 3.3 to 3.6 billion people are highly vulnerable to climate change. Many of them live in west, central and east Africa, south Asia, central and South America, as well as in small island developing states, such as Vanuatu in the Pacific, and in the Arctic.

As countries in these regions divert more of their wealth towards preparing for and recovering from storms, spreading deserts and melting glaciers, they are left with less money to cut their emissions and contribute to meeting the 1.5°C goal agreed at the negotiations in Paris in 2015. Rich countries, who are responsible for most emissions, promised US$100 billion (£87.2 billion) a year in aid in 2015.

But a recent UN report found that international finance to help the most vulnerable countries adapt to climate change (with bigger sea walls, for instance) has amounted to less than one-tenth of what is needed, and the gap between the two is widening. The US, UK, Canada and Australia are among the biggest laggards when their historical responsibility for climate change is taken into account. There has been no separate funding to address the damage already caused by warming.

At COP26 in 2021, developing countries proposed a loss and damage finance facility to help communities recovering from disasters and compensate them for what they have lost already. The EU and US resisted this in the final days of talks.

Instead, the Glasgow Dialogue was established: a series of discussions about how to arrange funding to help countries bearing the brunt of climate change. Delegates from developing country were sorely disappointed. Instead of material support, they got another talking shop.

But many of these same negotiators are heading into COP27 with new resolve. Here are three reasons why loss and damage is becoming harder for rich countries to ignore.

1. The latest science

Attribution science, which clarifies the links between extreme weather events and emissions, has taken great leaps forward in recent years. Across more than 400 studies, scientists have examined wildfires in the US, heatwaves in India and Pakistan, typhoons in Asia and record-breaking rainfall in the UK.

Broadly, this research shows the poorest and most vulnerable are bearing the heaviest burden despite having contributed the least to the problem. This growing evidence base bolsters the case for reparations.

2. Climate impacts are escalating

The deadly floods in Pakistan in August are the latest in a series of disasters to push loss and damage up the global agenda. According to a recent study, as much as 50% of the rainfall would not have happened without climate change.

Pakistan’s leaders have said that wealthy countries must help pay the bill. After all, it is the latter’s actions that precipitated the disaster. Pakistan’s historically low emissions mean its own contribution to climate change is negligible.

From droughts in Somalia to floods in Nigeria, extreme weather during 2022 has also heaped suffering on African countries with little culpability for climate change. Given that COP27 will be held in Egypt and has been dubbed “the African COP”, these arguments will be brought to the fore.

3. Growing momentum outside of the UN process

The increasing number and importance of lawsuits brought against countries and companies failing to reduce their emissions highlights growing frustration with negotiations under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). As long as rich countries continue to evade the loss and damage issue, vulnerable countries and communities – and their lawyers – will search for alternative solutions.

That is not to say they haven’t had some notable recent successes. The UN Human Rights Committee (UNHRC) decided in September that the Australian government is failing to protect the Torres Strait Islanders from the effects of climate change. This sets a precedent in international human rights law which could one day extend to governments and institutions which have affected people further afield.

But, outside the UN, poorer countries are organising to explore ever more sophisticated diplomatic and legal ways of applying pressure on rich countries. At COP26, the prime ministers of Antigua and Barbuda and Tuvalu launched a commission to explore the kinds of compensation small island states might seek under international law. A group of countries led by Vanuatu is heading for the International Court of Justice.

Since high levels of debt hinder their ability to recover from the ravages of climate change, African and small island leaders are demanding debtors (including development banks and rich countries) write off, suspend or reschedule payments so that vulnerable nations can spend more on cutting emissions and adapting to climate change. These proposals have been called “debt for climate swaps”.

The International Monetary Fund recently announced a resilience and sustainability trust to help shield the finances of vulnerable countries from climate disasters, suggesting development policy is slowly shifting. This followed campaigning by Mia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados.

Strings attached

Some rich countries are now taking action, suggesting a growing acknowledgement that this funding cannot be delayed forever. In September, Denmark was the first UN party to pledge finance – about US$13 million – to address loss and damage. The G7, under the leadership of the German presidency, has launched an initiative to expand access to financial aid in the immediate aftermath of climate disasters through improvements to existing insurance and social security schemes.

Because these initiatives have come outside of the UNFCCC negotiations, donor countries are free to dictate the terms of their support, sidestepping a process that should be about meeting the needs of vulnerable communities. Much of their funding will go into insurance schemes. Many of the insurance firms that would benefit are based in Europe and the US.

Insurance payouts may be a lifeline for drought-scarred small farmers and flooded homeowners. But some risks are uninsurable, especially those with a slow onset, such as those resulting from sea-level rise. Then there are less tangible harms, such as lost livelihoods, illness and biodiversity loss. Insurance against cyclones won’t compensate fishers in Tuvalu who stand to lose their coastal fisheries as coral reefs succumb to warming.

The next front in the loss and damage debate will involve exploring whether providing finance as a form of solidarity (rather than compensation) is more palatable for rich countries. If that money is wrapped up in insurance schemes, designed to enrich consultants, it won’t really help poor countries. Progress at COP27 will be determined by whether these nations feel the UNFCCC is even capable of helping them.

81355438-24cb-430b-8eda-7f6f57ff47d0,"Money is likely to be a flashpoint at the UN Cop27 climate summit starting on Sunday in Egypt, where world leaders will attempt to tackle the climate crisis.

The initial sums involved are just a month’s worth of the fossil fuel industry’s profits. Yet, say experts, the failure so far to deliver promised funding has corroded international trust so much that it could undermine the whole UN process – the only global forum for fighting global heating.

The most fiery issue will be “loss and damage”, the new funding from rich, polluting countries needed to rescue and rebuild poorer communities after climate disasters they have done little to cause. It has been a taboo subject for decades, but with climate impacts rapidly worsening from Pakistan to Puerto Rico, countries representing the vast majority of the global population insist it must finally be addressed.

There are plenty of ideas for raising the money, from taxing fossil fuel companies to the “nuclear option” of catastrophe-hit countries cancelling their foreign debt. A push for reform of the multilateral development banks, including the World Bank, with or without its beleaguered boss, David Malpass, who recently said he “does not know” if he accepts climate science, is also gathering momentum. The minimum that Cop27 must deliver, say campaigners, is a new finance facility into which loss and damage cash can be put.

Climate finance has three purposes: cutting emissions, adapting to the climate crisis, and paying for loss and damage. In 2015, rich countries promised $100bn a year by 2020 for the first two purposes. It has yet to deliver, which is a “shameful” failure, according to African countries, but may do so by 2023. The global economic gloom is also casting a shadow over fundraising efforts.

However, to put $100bn into perspective, it is 37 days’ worth of the oil and gas sector’s average profits over the past 50 years. In the context of this year, it is about half the revenue that Russia has received for fossil fuel exports since it invaded Ukraine. “There is no question – the money is there. It’s being used for the wrong things,” said Prof Saleemul Huq, a Cop veteran and the director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Bangladesh.

For loss and damage, the funding offered to vulnerable countries was zero until very recently. But the dam was broken by Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland, at Cop26 in Glasgow in 2021, with £2m now promised.

Calls for loss and damage finance have been repeatedly rejected by the US and other large economies, which fear liability for trillions of dollars in climate compensation.

But the issue cannot be avoided any longer, according to the UN secretary general, António Guterres. “This is a moral imperative that cannot be ignored and Cop27 must be the place for action on loss and damage,” he said in October. “This is the No 1 litmus test of how seriously governments take the growing climate toll on the most vulnerable countries.”

Madeleine Diouf Sarr, who will chair the Least Developed Countries group of 46 nations at Cop27, said: “We can no longer afford to have a Cop that is ‘all talk’.”

The fundamental case for loss and damage funds is that rich polluting countries caused the climate crisis but poorer, developing countries , with tiny carbon emissions, are worst hit by the impacts.

“Loss and damage is the greatest injustice for our generation,” said the Rwandan youth campaigner Grace Ineza, a co-founder of the International Loss and Damage Youth Coalition. “Our generation did not cause climate change, but we are the ones who are going to be left with the huge impact of it.”

Beyond the direct benefits of funding, money is also the currency of trust, said Huq, which is why the missed $100bn target matters so much. “It is a simple matter of credibility of the developed countries to fulfil what they say they will do and they failed,” he said. “So why should developing countries even bother talking to them anymore?”

Such loss of trust has serious real-world ramifications, according to the climate finance expert Kate Levick, at the E3G thinktank. The big greenhouse gas emissions of the future will come from the major emerging economies, such as India, Indonesia, Brazil and China, unless they take bold action that is supported by their populations, she said. “To do that, they have to feel they have the real support of the richer countries and that there will be funds to help them.”

Finance is critical to Cop27 and almost all the key issues, for Levick, come down to finance. She believes solving them is going to be key to the continuation of the UN forum as a driver of climate action.

Laurence Tubiana, a key architect of the breakthrough Paris climate deal in 2015, said that without some movement on loss and damage, “the legitimacy of [the UN process] will be challenged”.

Sameh Shoukry, Egypt’s foreign minister and president of Cop27, acknowledged the danger of problems with finance: “Without appropriate and fair finance serving as a catalyst, we will all continue to struggle in delivering impactful climate action.”

At Cop26, a group of 130 countries, representing 85% of the world’s population, demanded a loss and damage funding facility be set up, but the US and EU blocked it.

In the run-up to Cop27, the US and EU were still rejecting the idea of loss and damage payments. John Kerry, the US special envoy for climate change, was asked about such funding in September. “You tell me the government in the world that has trillions of dollars, because that’s what it costs,” he replied bluntly, adding that he would not be “feeling guilty” about it.

The EU climate chief, Frans Timmermans, also recently challenged the power of the moral argument for loss and damage: “Let’s be frank: many of our citizens in Europe will not buy this argument today because their worries are linked to their own existence in this energy crisis, in this food crisis, in this inflation crisis.”

As Cop27 drew nearer, the US and EU softened their language, saying they would at least not obstruct talks on loss and damage.

Huq said: “I would recommend [Kerry and Timmermans] talk to Nicola Sturgeon, who broke the taboo [on loss and damage funding]. Denmark has also broken ranks, the first national government.” Denmark has pledged $13m, with the development minister, Flemming Møller Mortensen, saying in September: “We are putting action behind words.”

The contributions of Scotland and Denmark have high symbolic importance, but the sums needed for loss and damage are vast. Developing countries are on track to suffer $290bn-$580bn in loss and damages every year, according to one widely cited study, rising to more than $1tn by 2050. Add in the funding needed to switch to a low-carbon economy and pay for adaptation projects, and all assessments come up with a total of trillions of dollars.

There are a plethora of proposals in play for finding such funds, beyond government grants. “The window is wide open right now in terms of ideas,” said Levick. “There hasn’t been really big thinking coming through the G7 and G20 forums, partly because of political constraints.”

Huq added: “We should try all of them. I say let a hundred flowers bloom.”

Guterres told world leaders in September: “Polluters must pay. I am calling on all developed economies to tax the windfall profits of fossil fuel companies.” The youth activist Ineza backed this: “The first channel will be making the polluters pay, because polluters are the main drivers of [the climate crisis].”

The world’s most vulnerable countries are preparing to back calls for an ongoing tax on fossil fuel extraction, or global taxes on carbon emissions, airline travel, shipping fuels or financial transactions. A combination of these might raise $200bn a year, according to experts, though Levick warned: “International agreements about tax regimes are always very difficult. That said, there are a number of countries going ahead with [fossil fuel] windfall taxes.”

The biggest momentum is swinging behind dramatic reform of the international financial institutions and multilateral development banks, such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, which collectively hold $1.5tn in assets. This is backed by Guterres, the UN’s new climate chief, Simon Stiell, Cop26 president Alok Sharma and, crucially, the head of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva, who said: “If we don’t shift our trajectory [to higher investment in climate action] this decade, we are cooked.”

Critics say the institutions, set up in the aftermath of the second world war, were appropriate for the 20th century, but not for the climate and other cross-border crises of the 21st century. Reforms could include cheaper loans for green projects and allowing the institutions to de-risk clean energy projects for the private sector by co-investing.

However, the lead institution, the World Bank, is seen as a drag. “We haven’t had the leadership expected from the World Bank,” Levick said.

Malpass, the bank’s boss, was appointed by then US president Donald Trump in 2019. In September Malpass was asked if he accepted the scientific consensus that fossil fuel burning was causing dangerous climate change. “I don’t even know, I am not a scientist and that is not a question,” he replied. The former US vice-president Al Gore previously said it was “ridiculous to have a climate denier as head of the World Bank”. Malpass later said he was not a denier, but campaigners are calling for him to be replaced.

After the row, 10 major economies, including the US, UK and Germany, handed a joint proposal for “fundamental reform” to the World Bank, expecting a response by the end of 2022. The IMF launched its Resilience and Sustainability Trust with $20bn from donors including China in October, to “support countries building resilience to structural challenges such as climate change and pandemics”.

Another set of financial reforms, the Bridgetown Agenda, is being championed by Mia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados, whose outspoken appearances at Cop26 won her many plaudits. It calls for the mobilisation immediately of $100bn “to those who need it”, the suspension of interest penalties for heavily indebted countries, debt payment suspension for the poorest countries, a “global mechanism” for loss and damage funding, and a longer-term $650bn fund to help accelerate private clean energy investment.

“We cannot be good at rescuing banks but bad at saving countries,” the Agenda document says. Avinash Persaud, the special envoy to Mottley, said: “We believe the multilateral development banks can extend their lending by $1tn. There is a critical moment here because we have the grotesque coincidence of the oil producers making approaching $200bn of profits in the last quarter at the same time that a third of Pakistan is underwater: the cost in Pakistan, they say, is $40bn.”

A foreign debt crisis in poor countries, intensified by the Covid pandemic, also looms, with more than 60% of low-income countries in, or at high risk of, debt distress, according to the IMF. If climate finance comes in the form of further loans, that simply adds to high debt mountains. For example, small island states at extreme risk from climate impacts pay at least 18 times more in loan repayments than they receive in climate finance.

Such concerns have raised the idea of countries, such as flood-stricken Pakistan, stopping debt repayments to rich countries. Twenty countries highly vulnerable to the climate crisis may halt the repayment of the $685bn they owe, said Mohamed Nasheed, the former president of the Maldives, recently: “We are living not just on borrowed money, but on borrowed time.”

Levick said: “That’s a bit of a nuclear option. But it is one that feels like it’s getting closer to being on the table, simply because of the dire situations that many of these countries are in.”

Prof Carlos Lopes, at the University of Cape Town, South Africa, said such a move could be justified by the low emissions of developing nations: “African countries have a carbon credit, and we need to transform that carbon credit into debt forgiveness. If we don’t, we are really not taking into account loss and damage.” Some experts suggest debt reduction could be given in return for climate action.

Direct funding from rich countries for phasing out coal use is under way, although only on a country-by-country basis. South Africa may be the first to receive such funds – though the $8.5bn deal is yet to be sealed – followed by Vietnam, Indonesia and Mexico.

Providing insurance against climate disasters for poorer countries has also been trialled, but there are concerns over the affordability of premiums for events that are growing ever more likely. “Climate change is an uninsurable event,” Persaud said. “We need actual money.”

Demands for loss and damage funds could be boosted by a legal opinion being sought from the world’s highest court, the UN’s international court of justice (ICJ), on the obligations countries have to other climate-vulnerable countries and to future generations.

The advisory opinion is being requested by Vanuatu and its allies, and Bakoa Kaltongga, Vanuatu’s special envoy on climate change for the Pacific, said: “We are moving far too slowly, at a pace that does not reflect the devastation experienced every day in our communities. This is an existential crisis. ICJ advisory opinions hold great legal and moral authority, enough in the past to substantially change state behaviour on critical global issues.”

At Cop27, the minimum required is the establishment of a loss and damage finance facility into which funds could be put, said Ineza. Levick added: “We need to build enough trust, and that is going to involve donor countries offering enough on some of these contentious issues – loss and damage is going to be a key flashpoint.”

Huq is one of a handful of people in the world who have attended the UN’s climate Cop every year since they began in 1995. He said: “I’m always optimistic because the UN climate summit, for all its faults, is the only place where we the vulnerable, poor, developing countries have a seat at the table and the opportunity to argue and convince the big countries.

“We don’t usually win, but occasionally we do get something if we get our act together, and we can make good arguments and get allies on our side. But I’m also usually disappointed at the end.”"
90756bf8-c536-4ada-b4a4-99ec1082eea1,"You may be hearing the phrase “loss and damage” in the coming weeks as government leaders meet in Egypt for the 2022 U.N. Climate Change Conference.

It refers to the costs, both economic and physical, that developing countries are facing from climate change impacts. Many of the world’s most climate-vulnerable countries have done little to cause climate change, yet they are experiencing extreme heat waves, floods and other climate-related disasters. They want wealthier nations – historically the biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions – to pay for the harm.

A powerful example is Pakistan, where extreme rainfall on the heels of a glacier-melting heat wave flooded nearly one-third of the country in the summer of 2022.

The flooding turned Pakistan’s farm fields into miles-wide lakes that stranded communities for weeks. More than 1,700 people died, millions lost their homes and livelihoods, and more than 4 million acres of crops and orchards, as well as livestock, drowned or were damaged. This was followed by a surge in malaria cases as mosquitoes bred in the stagnant water.

Pakistan contributes only about 1% of the global greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change. But greenhouse gases don’t stay within national borders – emissions anywhere affect the global climate. A warming climate intensifies rainfall, and studies suggest climate change may have increased Pakistan’s rainfall intensity by as much as 50%.

The question of payments for loss and damage has been a long-standing point of negotiation at United Nations climate conferences, held nearly every year since 1995, but there has been little progress toward including a financial mechanism for loss and damage in international climate agreements.

Many developing countries are looking to this year’s conference, COP27, as a crucial moment for making progress on establishing that formal mechanism.

Africa’s climate conference

With Egypt hosting this year’s U.N. climate conference, it’s not surprising that loss and damage will take center stage.

Countries in Africa have some of the lowest national greenhouse gas emissions, and yet the continent is home to many of the world’s most climate-vulnerable countries.

To deal with climate change, these countries – many of them among the world’s poorest – will have to invest in adaptation measures, such as seawalls, climate-smart agriculture and infrastructure that’s more resilient to high heat and extreme storms. The UN Environment Program’s Adaptation Gap Report, released Nov. 3, 2022, found that developing countries need five to 10 times more international adaptation finance than wealthier countries are providing.

When climate disasters strike, countries also need more financial help to cover relief efforts, infrastructure repairs and recovery. This is loss and damage.

Egypt is emphasizing the need for wealthy countries to make more progress on providing financial support for both adaptation and loss and damage.

Climate injustice and loss and damage

The conversation on loss and damage is inherently about equity. It evokes the question: Why should countries that have done little to cause global warming be responsible for the damage resulting from the emissions of wealthy countries?

That also makes it contentious. Negotiators know that the idea of payments for loss and damage has the potential to lead to further discussions about financial compensation for historical injustices, such as slavery in the United States or colonial exploitation by European powers.

At COP26, held in 2021 in Glasgow, Scotland, negotiators made progress on some key issues, such as stronger emissions targets and pledges to double adaptation finance for developing countries. But COP26 was seen as a disappointment by advocates trying to establish a financial mechanism for wealthier nations to provide finance for loss and damage in developing countries.

What a formal mechanism might look like

The lack of resolution at COP26, combined with Egypt’s commitment to focus on financing for adaptation and loss and damage, means the issue will be on the table this year.

The nonprofit Center for Climate and Energy Solutions expects discussions to focus on institutional arrangements for the Santiago Network for Loss and Damage, which focuses on providing technical assistance to help developing countries minimize loss and damage; and on fine-tuning the Glasgow Dialogue, a formal process developed in 2021 to bring countries together to discuss funding for loss and damage.

The V20 group of finance ministers, representing 58 countries highly vulnerable to climate change, and the G-7 group of wealthy nations also reached an agreement in October 2022 on a financial mechanism called the Global Shield Against Climate Risks. The Global Shield is focused on providing risk insurance and rapid financial assistance to countries after disasters, but it’s unclear how it will fit into the international discussions. Some groups have raised concerns that relying on insurance systems can overlook the poorest people and distract from the larger discussion of establishing a dedicated fund for loss and damage.

Two elements of developed countries’ reluctance to formalize a loss and damage mechanism involve how to determine which countries or communities are eligible for compensation and what the limitations of such a mechanism would be.

What would a threshold for loss and damage eligibility look like? Limiting countries or communities from receiving compensation for loss and damage based on their current emissions or gross domestic product could become a problematic and complicated process. Most experts recommend determining eligibility based on climate vulnerability, but this can also prove difficult.

How will world leaders respond?

Over a decade ago, developed countries committed to provide US$100 billion per year to fund adaptation and mitigation in developing countries. But they have been slow to meet that commitment, and it does not cover the damages from the climate impacts the world is already seeing today.

Establishing a loss and damage mechanism is considered one avenue to provide recourse for global climate injustice. All eyes will be on Egypt Nov. 6-18, 2022, to see how world leaders respond.

This article was updated Nov. 3, 2022, with the UNEP Adaptation Gap Report findings."
ac05737d-1da9-4eb5-bd40-daa13ba0b2f3,"Global leaders and business executives gathered in Glasgow last year, declaring the annual UN Climate Change Conference COP 26 the “last and best chance” to avert a climate catastrophe. More than 450 corporations vowed to mobilize billions of dollars in climate financing alongside the world’s largest economies, to accelerate the transition to net-zero emissions.

One year on, climate ambitions at Egypt’s Sharm el-Sheikh are expected to be much more subdued as COP 27 kicks off its two-week-long event. This is primarily due to a prolonged war in Europe and fears about a global economic downturn testing the resolve of the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitters and their commitment to climate action.

Since the summit in Scotland last November, just 24 of the 193 countries that agreed to ramp up their climate actions have followed through on their plans, according to the UN. Meanwhile, the financial companies that signed onto the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, vowing to cut emissions and pressure companies that rely on their financing to follow, have been slow to implement their ambitions.

A recent study by Accenture found that just 34% of the world’s top 2,000 publicly traded companies had publicly stated net zero targets, while a mere 7% are on track to achieve their own targets for scope 1 and 2 or direct emissions.

“We’ve had a lot of shocks thrown on top which does impact business priorities,” said Claus Aagaard, Chief Financial Officer of Mars, a leading advocate of sustainability, during a conversation earlier this fall.

“At some level, it’s easy enough to stay on the course of climate, if you make it integral to the way you think about the sustainability of your business and the planet, and if you put it in the context that at least 80 percent of consumers are telling us – that it’s important to them.”

Corporations 'wrestling' with decarbonization

Those priorities around climate action have been upended by the disruption caused by the war between Ukraine and Russia. The fighting that began in late February prompted major economies, particularly in Europe, to turn to fossil fuels to supplement shortfalls in Russian gas. Global coal power generation is on track to set a record for a second straight year, according to Bloomberg, despite a vow by world leaders to “phase down” coal in Scotland.

Story continues

In the US, President Biden’s ambitions to accelerate the transition to clean energy, in part through the Inflation Reduction Act, have been complicated by high gas prices and sagging poll numbers, as he publicly calls on oil companies to increase production and refining. Federal energy data shows the US has produced more crude oil since Biden took office than during the same period under former President Donald Trump, according to Politico.

The macroeconomic fallout from the pandemic and soaring costs brought on by supply chain disruptions and energy costs have complicated the task of decarbonization for corporations. The Accenture study found that 93% of G2000 companies that set net-zero targets are unlikely to reach them in the timeline they set out to, while a separate report by Bain and Company found that mounting global inflation has muddled the outlook for corporations to act on climate.

“At a time when they are plotting their downturn strategy, many corporations that set ambitious decarbonization targets are wrestling with what they can now afford to do to accelerate decarbonization and monetize it with customers,” the report said.

COP27 Priorities

The agenda at COP27 is largely expected to focus on four key areas: mitigation, loss and damage, adaptation, and finance. Leaders from developing countries that have been hardest hit by climate change are expected to push for reparations, paid for by the world’s richest countries, to shoulder the cost of “loss and damage” caused by extreme weather events.

In the last year alone, 37 million people have faced hunger and starvation in the greater Horn of Africa following record drought, while a third of Pakistan submerged under water following record rainfall.

The largest greenhouse gas emitters, including the US, have long resisted the idea of a reparations fund.

”This is a fundamental question of climate justice, international solidarity, and trust,” said Amina Mohammed, UN Deputy Secretary General, in a statement ahead of COP27. “Those who have contributed the least to the crisis are being hit the hardest. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, if you are living in one of the hotspots for the climate crisis in the global south you are 15 times more likely to die from a climate disaster.”

'No time for delay'

New data shows the window to avert the worst of the climate crisis is closing quickly. The latest report by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found that emissions “unequivocally caused by human activities” have warmed global temperatures by 1.1°C already.

Temperatures will increase until the middle of the century under all emissions scenarios considered, with warming expected to exceed 1.5°C to 2°C, increasing the intensity and frequency of extreme weather.

Only drastic emissions cuts in the next few decades is likely to prevent warming from spiraling out of control, according to the UN.

“The science is unequivocal, the changes are unprecedented, and there is no more time for delay,” the report said.

8c473617-8616-4102-9732-67ac5bcce4d3,"Nearly 200 countries gathering for the UN climate conference in Egypt are expected to lock horns over whether rich nations should pay compensation to vulnerable states hit by climate-fuelled disasters.

The COP27 summit follows a year of such disasters, from floods that killed more than 1700 people in Pakistan to drought-withering crops in China, Africa and the US West.

That has intensified developing country demands for a special ""Loss and Damage"" fund. But with rich countries resisting such calls, the issue has been stalled for years.

Here's where things stand ahead of COP27.

WHAT IS ""LOSS AND DAMAGE""?

In UN climate talks, the phrase ""Loss and Damage"" refers to costs already being incurred from climate-fuelled weather extremes or impacts, like rising sea levels.

Climate funding so far has focused on cutting carbon dioxide emissions in an effort to curb climate change, while about a third of it has gone toward projects to help communities adapt to future impacts.

Loss and damage funding would be different, in compensating costs that countries can't avoid or ""adapt"" to.

But there is no agreement yet over what should count as ""loss and damage"" in climate disasters - which can include damaged infrastructure and property, as well as harder-to-value natural ecosystems or cultural assets like burial grounds.

A June report by 55 vulnerable countries estimated their combined climate-linked losses over the last two decades totalled about $US525 billion ($A812 billion), or about 20 per cent of their collective GDP.

Some research suggests that by 2030 such losses could reach $US580 billion ($A897 billion) per year.

WHO PAYS? WHO GETS PAID?

These questions are extremely contentious.

Vulnerable countries and campaigners have argued that rich countries that caused the bulk of climate change with their historical emissions should now pay. The United States and European Union have resisted the argument, fearing spiralling liabilities.

If countries do agree to launch a fund, they would need to thrash out details such as where the money should come from, how much wealthy countries should pay, and which countries or disasters qualify for compensation.

The EU and United States blocked a proposal at last year's UN climate talks to establish a fund, agreeing instead to a ""dialogue"" without a clear end goal. Over the last month, they have signalled more openness to discussing compensation at COP27, but remain wary of creating a fund.

Only a few governments have made small, symbolic funding commitments for loss and damage: Denmark and Scotland, plus the Belgian region of Wallonia.

Some existing UN and development bank funding does help states facing loss and damage, though it is not officially earmarked for that goal.

WHAT WILL HAPPEN AT COP27?

Developing countries have proposed putting loss and damage on the summit agenda, which must be adopted unanimously before the talks get underway.

Frustrated by difficulties and delays in securing climate finance, developing and emerging economies are now united in demanding that a loss and damage fund be established at COP27.

Among them are island states like the Maldives and Jamaica, and China, itself the world's biggest CO2 emitter, which has rankled some European officials who say China should be providing climate finance, not demanding it.

Countries have made different proposals for what the fund should look like. Even if COP27 yields a deal to form a fund, it could still take a couple years before it is ready to disperse money.

Some diplomats have suggested a ""mosaic"" of funding sources be organised, rather than one central fund.

Another proposal from the Alliance of Small Island States suggests COP27 agree to form a UN-hosted ""response fund"" to collect cash from various sources for countries struck by disasters.

The EU has suggested harnessing existing international funds to tackle loss and damage, rather than launching a new one, but some experts say issues like long delays make those funds unsuitable for addressing loss and damage.

WHAT IF COP27 FAILS TO ADVANCE THE ISSUE?

Already mistrustful after wealthy nations failed to deliver $US100 billion ($A155 billion) in climate finance annually by 2020, some countries are exploring other routes.

The ""V20"" group of 58 vulnerable countries and the Group of Seven rich nations plan to launch an effort called ""Global Shield"" at COP27, aimed at strengthening insurance and disaster protection finance.

Meanwhile, climate-vulnerable countries are seeking contributions for a pilot loss and damage funding facility. Other ideas include UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres's call for a windfall profit tax on fossil fuel companies to raise funding.

The Pacific island country Vanuatu, meanwhile, has asked the world's highest court - the International Court of Justice - to issue an opinion on the right to be protected from adverse climate impacts.

An ICJ opinion could carry moral authority and legal weight, strengthening calls for compensating poor nations."
9d64d239-36de-4b5c-b9a1-99957764107a,"UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has told delegates at the start of the COP27 summit in Egypt they face a stark choice to work together now to cut emissions or condemn future generations to climate catastrophe.

The speech was intended to set an urgent tone as governments sit down for two weeks of talks on how to avert the worst impacts of climate change, even as they are distracted by Russia's war in Ukraine, rampant consumer inflation and energy shortages.

""Humanity has a choice: cooperate or perish,"" Guterres told delegates gathered in the seaside resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh on Monday.

Guterres called for a pact between the world's richest and poorest countries to accelerate the transition from fossil fuels and speed up delivery of the funding needed to ensure poorer countries can reduce emissions and cope with the unavoidable impacts of warming that has already occurred.

""The two largest economies - the United States and China - have a particular responsibility to join efforts to make this pact a reality,"" he said.

Guterres asked countries to agree to phase out the use of coal, one of the most carbon-intense fuels, by 2040 globally, with members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development hitting that mark by 2030.

Despite decades of climate talks - the Egypt COP is the 27th Conference of the Parties - progress has been insufficient to save the planet from excessive warming as countries are too slow or reluctant to act, he noted.

""Greenhouse gas emissions keep growing. Global temperatures keep rising. And our planet is fast approaching tipping points that will make climate chaos irreversible,"" he said. ""We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator.""

Signatories to the 2015 Paris climate agreement pledged to achieve a long-term goal of keeping global temperatures from rising more than 1.5degC above pre-industrial levels.

Scientists have set this as the ceiling for avoiding catastrophic climate change.

Guterres said that to keep any hope alive of meeting that goal means achieving global net zero emissions by 2050.

""It is either a Climate Solidarity Pact - or a Collective Suicide Pact,"" he said."

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) produces reports roughly every five years that represent a global scientific consensus on climate change, its causes and its impact. Last year’s report tackled the main drivers of global warming and the core elements of climate science.

That was followed by two major reports this year – one in February addressing how the world will need to adapt to climate impacts, from rising seas to dwindling wildlife, and another in April on ways for “mitigating” or reining in climate-warming emissions.

Here are some of the key takeaways from those reports:

The science report

Last year’s report on the physical basis of climate change pulled no punches, stating unequivocally that humans are to blame for rising temperatures.

It also warned climate change was already dangerously close to spinning out of control.

Once-rare weather extremes are becoming more common, and some regions are more vulnerable than others.

For the first time, the report’s authors called for urgent action to curb methane. Up to this point, the IPCC had focused on only carbon dioxide, the most abundant greenhouse gas.

With time running out, the authors said it was worth looking into the benefits and drawbacks of geoengineering, or large-scale interventions to shift the climate, such as injecting particles into the atmosphere to block out solar radiation.

The report warned the world’s nations, including the wealthy ones, that everyone needed to start preparing for climate impacts and adapting to a warmer world.

The adaptation report

News of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine eclipsed the release in February of a seminal report on how the world should prepare for a warmer reality.

With climate change already fueling extreme weather worldwide, the report urged rich and poor countries alike to adapt to impacts including more frequent heatwaves, stronger storms and higher sea levels.

The report made clear that different regions face different risks and impacts, and offered localised projections for what to expect.

Millions of people face poverty and food insecurity in coming years, as climate change hits crops and water supplies and threatens to disrupt trade and labour markets.

The daunting forecast for the world’s poor reignited calls for a “Loss and Damage” fund through which rich nations would compensate poor countries for costs incurred dealing with climate-fueled disasters – a key demand by vulnerable countries going into the COP27 talks.

Wealthy nations have long promised to find 100 billion dollars a year in climate finance for poor nations, with the target originally meant to have been hit in 2020.

It was first promised in 2009, but has never been accomplished. A report last year suggested it would not come to fruition until 2023. Mr Guterres also defended his use of dramatic language, saying the world is approaching ""tipping points"" that will ""make [climate breakdown] irreversible"".

""And as we are approaching those tipping points, we need to increase the urgency, we need to increase the ambition, and we need to rebuild trust, mainly trust between north and south,"" he said. ""Because at the present level, we will be doomed. Present policies will be absolutely catastrophic.

""And the truth is that we will not be able to change this situation if a pact is not put in place between developed countries and the emerging economies.""

d0c83288-bab9-4849-93ff-252fbc4d0ade,"Glaciers across the globe – including the last ones in Africa – will be unavoidably lost by 2050 due to climate change, the UN says in a report. A third of glaciers located in UN World Heritage sites will melt within three decades, a UNESCO report found. Mount Kilimanjaro’s last glaciers will vanish as will glaciers in the Alps and Yosemite National Park in the US. They will melt regardless of the world’s actions to combat climate change, the authors say.

Other glaciers can be saved only if greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions “are drastically cut” and global warming is capped at 1.5 degrees Celsius, the Paris-based UNESCO warned in its report.

About 50 of the organization’s more than 1,150 World Heritage sites have glaciers, which together constitute almost a tenth of the world’s glaciered area.

The almost 19,000 glaciers located at heritage sites are losing more than 60 billion tons of ice a year, which amounts to the annual water consumption of Spain and France combined, and accounts for about 5 percent of global sea-level rise, UNESCO said.

“Glaciers are retreating at an accelerated rate worldwide,” said Tales Carvalho Resende, a hydrology expert with UNESCO.

The organization described a “cycle of warming” in which the melting of glaciers causes the emergence of darker surfaces, which then absorb even more heat and speed up the retreat of ice.

Besides drastic cuts in emissions, the UNESCO report calls for better monitoring of glaciers and the use of early warning mechanisms to respond to natural disasters, including floods caused by bursting glacial lakes. Such floods have already cost thousands of lives and may have partly fueled Pakistan’s catastrophic inundations this year.

While there have been some local attempts to reduce melt rates — for example, by covering the ice with blankets — Carvalho Resende cautioned that scaling up those experiments “might be extremely challenging, because of costs but also because most glaciers are really difficult to access.”

Throughout history, glaciers have grown during very cold periods and shrunk when those stretches ended. The world’s last very cold period ended over 10,000 years ago, and some further natural melting was expected in Europe after the last “Little Ice Age” ended in the 19th century.

But as carbon dioxide emissions surged over the past century, human factors began to quicken what had been expected to be a gradual natural retreat. In Switzerland, glaciers lost a record 6 percent of their volume just this year.

While the additional melting has to some extent balanced out other impacts of climate change — for instance, preventing rivers from drying out despite heat waves — it is rapidly reaching a critical threshold, according to UNESCO.

In its report, the organization writes that the peak in meltwater may already have been passed on many smaller glaciers, where the water is now starting to dwindle.

If the trend continues, the organization warned, “little to no base flow will be available during the dryer periods.”

The changes are expected to have major ramifications for agriculture, biodiversity, and urban life. “Glaciers are crucial sources of life on Earth,” UNESCO wrote.

“They provide water resources to at least half of humanity,” said Carvalho Resende, who cautioned that the cultural losses would also be immense.

Around the world, global warming is exposing ancient artifacts faster than they can be saved by archaeologists.

“Some of these glaciers are sacred places, which are really important for Indigenous peoples and local communities,” he said.

UNESCO cited the example of the centuries-old Snow Star Festival in the Peruvian Andes, which has already been impacted by ice loss. Spiritual leaders once shared blocks of glacier ice with pilgrims, but the practice was stopped when locals noticed the rapid retreat in recent years.

Small glaciers at low or medium altitudes will be the first to disappear. UNESCO said ice-loss rates in small glaciered areas “more than doubled from the early 2000s to the late 2010s.”

This matches observations from researchers who have studied the retreat of glaciers. Matthias Huss, a European glaciologist, said scientists had seen “very strong melting in the last two decades” in Switzerland.

At the same time, there are fewer and fewer places cold enough for glaciers to actually grow. “Nowadays, the limit where glaciers can still form new ice is at about 3,000 meters [about 9,840 feet],” he said, explaining that in recent decades that altitude has risen several hundred meters.

Farming Has To Be Changed Or Risk Destroying The Planet, Warns Big Agriculture

Food companies and governments must come together immediately to change the world’s agricultural practices or risk “destroying the planet”, according to the sponsors of a report by some of the largest food and farming businesses released on Thursday.

The report, from a task force within the Sustainable Markets Initiative (SMI), a network of global CEOs focused on climate issues established by King Charles III, is being released days before the start of the UN’s Cop27 climate summit in Egypt.

Many of the world’s largest food and agricultural businesses have championed sustainable agricultural practices in recent years. Regenerative farming practices, which prioritize cutting greenhouse gas emissions, soil health and water conservation, now cover 15% of croplands.

But the pace of change has been “far too slow”, the report finds, and must triple by 2030 for the world to have any chance of keeping temperature rises under 1.5C, a level that if breached, scientists argue, will unleash even more devastating climate change on the planet.

The report is signed by Bayer, Mars, McCain Foods, McDonald’s, Mondelez, Olam, PepsiCo, Waitrose and others. They represent a potent political and corporate force, impacting the food supply chain around the world. They are also, according to critics, some of those most responsible for climate mismanagement with one calling the report “smoke and mirrors” and unlikely to address the real crisis.

Food production is responsible for a third of all planet-heating gases emitted by human activity and a number of the signatories have been accused of environmental misdeeds and “greenwashing”. Activist Greta Thunberg is boycotting Cop this year having called the global summit a PR stunt “for leaders and people in power to get attention.”

“We are at a critical tipping point where something must be done,” said task force chair and outgoing Mars CEO, Grant Reid. “The interconnection between human health and planetary health is more evident than ever before.” Big food companies and agriculture must play a big part in changing that, said Reid. “It won’t be easy but we have got to make it work,” he said.

Agriculture is the world’s largest industry. Pasture and cropland occupy around 50% of the planet’s habitable land and uses about 70% of fresh water supplies. The climate crisis is challenging the industry across the world but the group’s call for change comes as the industry – which employs 1 billion people – is facing supply chain issues in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and soaring inflation. It also comes amid mounting skepticism about promises to change from companies that have contributed to climate change.

These current issues must not detract from the need for change, the report argues. “With the inflationary environment and widespread supply chain disruption, it would be easy to reduce our focus on the longer-term challenge of scaling regenerative farming. But we believe it is vital we maintain a sense of urgency. We must take action now to avoid more acute crises in the future,” its authors write.

Sunny George Verghese, chief executive of Olam, one of the world’s largest suppliers of cocoa beans, coffee, cotton and rice, said: “We cannot continue to produce and consume food and feed and fiber in the way we are doing today unless we don’t mind destroying the planet.”

“The only way out for us is how we transition to a more resilient food system that will allow us to meet the needs of a growing population without the resource intensity we have today.”

The report studied three food crops, potatoes, rice and wheat, and has made policy recommendations it will present at Cop27.

The task force’s members are working to make the short-term economic case for change more attractive to farmers. “It is just not compelling enough for the average farmer,” said Reid. More widely the report argues industry and government must also work harder to address the knowledge gap and make sure farmers are following best practices. Thirdly, all parties involved in the agriculture industry from farmers to food producers to government, banks and insurers need to align behind encouraging a shift to more sustainable practices.

“It involves change for all the players including the government, private, public companies and others. No one player can do this on their own, this has to be a collaboration of the willing. What needs to happen now is action and delivery,” said Reid.

Over the next six months, the group will assess how they can spread the task force’s work with the aim of establishing a common set of metrics for measuring environmental outcomes, establishing a credible system of payments for farmers for environmental outcomes, easing the cost of farmers transitioning to sustainable practices, ensuring government policy rewards farmers for greening their business and encouraging the sourcing of crops from particular areas converting to regenerative farming.

Devlin Kuyek, a researcher at GRAIN, a non-profit organization that works to support small farmers, said it was increasingly difficult for big agricultural and food companies to ignore climate change. “But I do not think any of these companies – say a McDonalds – has any commitment to curtail the sales of highly polluting products. I do not think PepsiCo is going to say the world doesn’t need Pepsi.”

Kuyek pointed out that Yara, another signatory to the report, is the world’s largest supplier of nitrogen-based fertilizers, “which are responsible for one out of every 40 tonnes of greenhouse gas emitted annually.”

“It is pretty disingenuous,” said Kuyek. “Small, local food systems still feed most of the people on the planet and the real threat is that the industrial system is expanding at the expense of the truly sustainable system. Corporations are creating a bit of smoke and mirrors here, suggesting they are part of the solution when inevitably they are part of the problem.”

Considering the controversial histories of some of the companies involved in the report, Verghese said he expected criticism and scrutiny. “All companies have to stand up to the scrutiny of being attacked if there is real greenwashing. There is no place to hide,” he said. “As far as Olam is concerned we are very clear on our targets, we have had the confidence to make these targets public. All of us have progressed along the sustainable journey. It is not that we have not made mistakes in the past but as we have become better at this we are willing to be subject to scrutiny.”

Both Reid and Verghese said the scale of the issues the world’s food supply is facing cannot be underplayed but that more governments and companies were becoming convinced of the need for urgent change. “I believe change can be made,” said Verghese. “I am optimistic. The fact that these kinds of coalitions are emerging is very positive. We are all otherwise very strong rivals and competitors. We hate each other’s guts, we do not come together on anything unless there is a huge crisis. Everyone is recognizing there is a huge crisis. We need to come together.”"

2e1e5626-21ba-4e65-aae8-0349b097d7e4,"In the year 1896, the Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius predicted that the rising concentration of carbon dioxide in the air could raise temperatures. Now, 126 years later, too may people still don’t buy it — even as the proof rages in our own backyards.

Denial is going out of fashion, and not just at the United Nations Climate Change Conference, or COP27, which is presently taking place in Egypt. Life as we know it will change, must change, in ways we cannot entirely foresee. But there are a few things we do know: Here are 10 ways the destabilization of climate is impacting us, in no particular order because they are all terrible.

1. Uncertainty, exacerbated: We don’t know how climate change will unfold because we are in uncharted territory, which is unnerving. Never before has atmospheric carbon dioxide risen so fast and gone so high. We know that CO2 affects temperature at a lag, which means we have barely begun to feel the impact of the carbon dioxide already pumped into our air. This means that even if we stopped all greenhouse gas emissions now, it’s only going to get hotter. We don’t know when or by how much. It’s getting harder for meteorologists to forecast weather, giving us less time to brace for (or flee) storms, floods and temperature spikes because, wouldn’t you know, it’s easier to predict weather in cold climates.

2. Sleeplessness, rising: Humans do not cope well with existential uncertainty – and heat also disturbs our sleep. One study estimates that by 2099, heat will reduce our sleep by up to 58 hours a year, which is a lot. It’s also speculative, because who knows how hot it will get by then. The authors point out that the greatest relative increases in heat are at night: We are used to night being cooler, and it’s getting less so. Air conditioners are not a solution; they’re not ubiquitous, and, considering the ecological damage they do, they’re not even a Band-Aid.

3. Mayhem, mounting: Tired, hot people tend to behave badly, and climate change is already fueling conflict regarding water, land and misogyny. The UN warns of increased risk to females from hot, angry males. Reem Alsalem of the UN calls climate change as “the most consequential threat multiplier for women and girls.”

4. Options, running out of: As sea levels rise, coastal communities will suffer. But just moving out and selling your beachfront home to a climate denier won’t cut it, because no place is safe. Some places are getting hit harder and earlier than others, but there is no climate change-free zone. Wealth can help, but only up to a point. As mentioned earlier, air-conditioning stadia is not a solution, and climate change will present unexpected challenges everywhere. Remember the couple who drowned in an elevator in Tel Aviv during a storm? Expect more such unforeseen tragedies in the years to come.

5. When it rains: Climate change is exacerbating flooding, because heat increases evaporation and warmer air holds more moisture, which all results in more rain in some places. The warmer atmosphere is also inherently more unstable. Inland cities far from the coast or rivers but equipped with antiquated drainage systems are also at risk, with low-lying areas vulnerable to inundation and higher ones to increasingly powerful storms, that in one of the vagaries of global warming, are now moving more slowly.

6. When it doesn’t rain: In Israel and the Mediterranean basin, researchers predict intense and irreversible aridification. And if you think seawalls are useless, try building one against the spreading Sahara, and just for the spice of life, rarer but increasingly powerful “medicanes” (Mediterranean hurricanes). So Israel, for one, will lose coastal land to the sea, and dry out, but when it storms, those storms will howl.

7. Sea level rise: As temperatures rise, ocean rise cannot be stopped. We don’t know how quickly oceans will rise, but Greenland, for example, is melting faster than had been thought. What to do? Oceanographer John Englander puts it best: prepare, and move to higher ground.

8. Marine apocalypse: Algae can’t photosynthesize when the water is too warm; corals are dying – it’s really no comfort at all that the “last reef” might be an Israeli one; marine ecosystems are being devastated, also thanks to overfishing and our inexorable habit of polluting, which isn’t related to climate change. The IPCC warns that in some places, ""particularly in near-surface waters, warming has already had dramatic impacts on marine animals, plants and microbes.” Blue-green algae, which causes toxic blooms, are, however, thriving.

9. Morbidity and mortality: Climate change affects the food we eat, the water we drink, the air we breathe, the soil on which we live and grow food and microbial and other life around us, so one can expect impacts on health. This applies to animals too — wild ones, pet ones, domestic ones whose planet we are using up. (Note that pollution and climate change are different problems.)

10. Impoverishment: When life becomes untenable, people aspire to move, but the question is to where. If, for instance, half-a-billion people seek to flee drought-stricken Africa and the Middle East, as has been predicted will happen, where is their sanctuary? The sobering book “An Inconvenient Apocalypse” (2022) points out that the world cannot sustain a population of 8 billion people (how many it can sustain is unclear, perhaps 2 or 3 billion). The authors do not speculate on timing or the fate of the billions the Earth apparently can’t sustain.

""And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth,"" Genesis 1:26 says. That has not gone well.

What can we do about it? Denial is counterproductive. We must radically change our habits, beliefs, values and aspirations. We face intolerable choices and aviating blueberries is an easy one: No more flying fruit. Or us. We must abandon our delusion that we were created by a god to be master of all we survey, and also, that we must personally visit exotic locations.

This is not the time or place to cast blame for what we have become and to what we have reduced our home. Nobody is moving to another planet and as you read this, carbon dioxide levels continue to rise. Gene banks won’t save us from extinctions; precious resources shouldn’t go to frivolities such as trying to resurrect the mammoth. Are we prepared for life to end rather than forgo the luxurious lifestyle to which we either became accustomed, or aspire? As the authors of “Inconvenient Apocalypse” stress, we want coffee in the morning, some Israelis love imported blueberries flown in from heaven knows where, but we don’t really need them."

November 4 - The biggest international climate event of the year is always preceded by a pile-up of reports, timed to be released in the week or two before delegates arrive.

Again this year, the U.N. Environment Programme’s annual Emissions Gap report stole the pre-COP headlines, highlighting the growing chasm between where the latest climate science says temperatures need to remain by 2050 to keep planet Earth safe for humans, and how high temperatures could rise, even if all the promises made by governments and businesses were to be fulfilled.

It was another sobering reality check piercing through the frothy net-zero rhetoric, revealing that unless climate commitments are strengthened, the world is on track for a 2.8C rise in temperature by the end of the century, 0.1C higher than was estimated in the UNEP’s assessment last year.

The body’s executive director, Inger Andersen, seemed close to tears when she briefed journalists about the report's findings: “We need to cut emissions by 45% by 2030 to keep 1.5C alive …. But this scenario isn’t credible because the policies aren’t in place. The science in the UNEP report is resounding … We are sliding from climate crisis to climate disaster.”

The sense of deepening gloom is also seen in the normally gung-ho U.N. Race to Zero campaign, led this year by High-Level Climate Champions Mahmoud Mohieldin and Nigel Topping, which aims to mobilize non-state actors including businesses and investors to set ambitious climate commitments, thereby giving governments cover to be even more ambitious in their own targets.

It was a blow when news came that the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), which was launched at COP26 last year in partnership with Race to Zero, is dropping its requirement for members to commit to Race to Zero’s standards, amid reports that many big banks were considering pulling out of the alliance, following the departure of two pension funds.

A key sticking point for the coalition, who have combined assets under management of $153 trillion, was Race to Zero’s requirement that signatories must ""phase out development, financing and facilitation of new unabated fossil fuel assets, including coal"".

GFANZ, led by former Bank of England governor Mark Carney, is now requiring that its members ""take note of the advice and guidance of the UN Climate Change High Level Champions and the Race to Zero"".

Other reports highlighted the biggest roadblock that is standing in the way of net-zero: the crying lack of accurate, actionable data.

SAP, in its latest survey of 328 business leaders in the UK, found 90% linking their long-term profitability with environmental sustainability, a jump of 19% on last year. However, just 8% are satisfied with the quality of their data, and 40% rely solely upon assumptions, estimates and industry averages to screen the environmental impact of their supply chains.

Another study from Boston Consulting Group, of 1,600 large organizations globally, found that only 10% were able to fully quantify their carbon emissions across all three scopes, a tiny improvement on 9% last year. And despite supply chain emissions (Scope 3) accounting for some 80% of most companies’ carbon footprint, only 12% of respondents identify Scope 3 as a priority for emissions reduction.

In his testimony to a UK parliamentary committee inquiry into net-zero late last month, Mark Carney said a new tool called the Net Zero Data Public Utility will be up and running by this time next year, which he said would make climate transition-related data publicly available in a single place for the first time. “This will show who is doing well (in achieving net-zero targets), and where there are holes … Once there’s confidence that we (GFANZ signatories) have it right, you could make an argument for regulation” for the entire financial sector, he told MPs.

In that respect it was welcome news when the new UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, finally ended the “will he, won’t he” speculation by announcing he would join other world leaders at COP27 this week in Sharm el-Sheik. The UK was the first country to regulate to make it mandatory for the government to meet climate targets, through its pioneering 2008 Climate Act. The Climate Change Committee was created as independent advisers, transparently holding the government to account.

Implementation is one of the big themes of this COP, and that starts with countries levelling the playing field by turning voluntary action by a few into mandatory action by the many through regulation. The UK has handed over the COP26 presidency, but its leadership is still important, not least in its demonstrated willingness to regulate.

However, a closer look with a longer time horizon reveals relationships between population size and climate change that can help us better understand both humanity’s predicament as the global population hits 8 billion people – a milestone the United Nations marked on Nov. 15, 2022.

Looking back to the Stone Age

For much of human evolution, our ancestors were exposed to large climatic fluctuations between ice ages and intermittent warmer periods. The last of these ice ages ended about 10,000 years ago.

Before the ice sheets melted, sea levels were about 400 feet (120 meters) lower than today. That allowed humans to migrate around the world. Everywhere they went, our ancestors reshaped landscapes, first by clearing forests and then through early agricultural practices that emerged in a number of regions starting just as the last ice age ended.

Paleoclimatologist William Ruddiman has suggested that these early actions – cutting down trees and expanding farming – caused a small initial rise in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. That contributed to a stable climate over the past 10,000 years by counteracting trends of declining carbon dioxide levels that might have triggered another glaciation event.

By reshaping landscapes, our ancestors actively constructed the niches they inhabited. This process is an important aspect of evolutionary change, creating important feedback dynamics between evolving species and their environment.

As humans evolved, the demands of the growing population, associated knowledge creation and energy use created a feedback cycle my colleagues and I call the Anthropocene engine. That engine has transformed the planet.

Revving up the Anthropocene engine

The Anthropocene engine has been running for at least 8,000 years. It led to the rise of modern civilizations and ultimately to the environmental challenges we face today, including climate change.

How does the Anthropocene engine work?

First, populations had to reach a critical number of people to successfully create enough knowledge about their environments that they could begin to actively and purposefully transform the niches they lived in.

Successful agriculture was the product of such knowledge. In turn, agriculture increased the amount of energy available to these early societies.

More energy supports more people. More people led to early settlements and, later, to cities. This allowed for task specialization and division of labor, which, in turn, accelerated the creation of more knowledge, which increased available energy and allowed population size to grow as well. And so on, and so on.

While the details of this process differ around the world, they are all driven by the same Anthropocene engine.

The problem of exponential growth

As an evolutionary biologist and historian of science, I have studied the evolution of knowledge and complexity for over three decades and have been developing mathematical models with colleagues to help explain these processes. Using the universality of the underlying processes driving the Anthropocene engine, we can capture these dynamics in the form of a growth equation, which includes links between population growth and increasing energy use.

One consequence of positive feedback cycles in dynamical systems is that they lead to exponential growth.

Exponential growth can start very slowly and be barely noticeable for quite some time. But eventually it will have dramatic consequences wherever resources are limited.

Driven by the Anthropocene engine, human population has grown exponentially, and individual societies have approached collapse multiple times over the past 8,000 years. The disappearance of the Easter Island civilization and the collapse of the Mayan empire, for example, have been linked to the depletion of environmental resources as populations rose. The dramatic decline of the European population during the Black Death in the 1300s was a direct consequence of crowded and unsanitary living conditions that facilitated the spread of Yersenia pestis, or plague.

Biologist Paul Ehrlich warned about unchecked growth in his 1968 book “The Population Bomb,” predicting growing global demand for limited resources would lead to societal collapse without changes in human consumption.

But globally, humanity has always found a way to avoid doom. Knowledge-based innovations, such as the Green Revolution – the broad-scale effects of which Ehrlich did not foresee – have enabled people to reset the clock, leading to more cycles of innovation and (almost) collapse.

One example is the sequence of energy regimes. It started with wood and animal power. Then came coal, oil and gas.

Fossil fuels powered the Industrial Revolution, and with it, greater wealth and advances in health care. But the age of fossil fuels has had dramatic consequences. It almost doubled the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in less than 300 years, causing the unprecedented speed of global warming that humanity is experiencing today.

At the same time, inequality has become endemic. Poorer nations that contributed little to climate change are suffering the most from global warming, while just 20 wealthier countries are responsible for about 80% of emissions.

The next energy transition to avoid collapse is underway now with the rise of renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. But studies – including a report released ahead of the 2022 U.N. Climate Change Conference in November – show humans aren’t evolving their energy use fast enough to keep climate change in check.

Using knowledge to reset the cycle again

Every species, if left unchecked, would grow exponentially. But species are subject to constraints – or negative feedback mechanisms – such as predators and limited food supplies.

The Anthropocene engine has allowed humans to emancipate ourselves from many of the negative feedback mechanisms that otherwise would have kept the population’s growth in check. We intensified food production, developed trade among regions and discovered medications to survive diseases.

Where does this leave humanity now? Are we approaching inevitable collapse from climate change of our own making, or can we transition again and discover innovations that reset the cycle?

Introducing negative feedback into our socioeconomic-technical systems – not as radical population control or war, but in the form of norms, values and regulations on excess greenhouse gas emissions – can help keep climate change in check.

Humanity can use knowledge to keep itself within its environmental boundaries.

According to a projection by the United Nations, on Nov. 15, our world population will cross the 8 billion mark, just 11 years after the 7 billion milestone was commemorated, on Oct. 31, 2011.

But without context, numbers this large almost feel meaningless. What even is a billion?

Picture this: It would require 105,669 gallon-size buckets to contain 8 billion drops of water. That many buckets, placed next to each other in a single row, would be 27.5 miles long — a bit more than the distance from Downtown San Diego to Encinitas.

Perhaps an easier way to comprehend the rapid growth that has caused our population to double in less than 50 years is through a visual depiction of human population growth over millennia. In a line chart, the trend practically stays horizontal for thousands of years before it creeps slowly upward for a few thousand more and then spikes — this image is called the population J-curve because of the shape the line makes when the plotted data points are connected.

The United Nations population projections that demographers consider most likely to play out show us reaching 9 billion people in 2037 and 10 billion people in the 2080s. But what if we could forestall those milestones to later dates? What if we could see our population peak earlier than projected and avoid ever having to know whether the planet can provide for 10 billion, 11 billion or 12 billion people?

Achieving this wouldn’t necessitate inventing new technology or making massive monetary investments (relatively speaking). It would simply require making modern contraception available to everyone who wants it so that people are able to decide for themselves whether and when to become pregnant and give birth. In the United States, 45 percent of pregnancies and 37 percent of births are unintended. This results in about 1.4 million unintended births each year — roughly the population of the city of San Diego.

While population growth is slowing and even reversing in some affluent nations, the U.S. population is still projected to rise to 400 million in 2058 from today’s population of 333 million.

The parts of the world with the fastest-growing populations are also the poorest and most vulnerable to environmental crises, especially those caused by climate change. The environmental repercussions of rapid population growth range from water scarcity to soil erosion to species extinctions. In the least developed countries — almost all of them in sub-Saharan Africa — people rely heavily on local ecosystem services. Therefore, the more people who live in a region, the more environmental destruction they cause to the water resources, soil health and wildlife they rely on for their very survival. And while the poorest people on the planet bear very little responsibility for the climate crisis that’s already upon us, a proven path to climate adaptation and resilience in vulnerable areas is through slower population growth.

International development efforts strive to help the poorest countries achieve a better standard of living through goals such as improved maternal and child health and survival; higher rates of school enrollment, literacy and employment; and reduced inequalities within and among countries. Achieving these and other goals will require poor people to increase their per capita consumption, as they rightfully should. Those of us who consume the most must urgently reduce our environmental footprints to accommodate necessary poverty reduction among those who consume the least. Slowing population growth is crucial to achieving a healthy environment and good quality of life for all. The actions we take (or fail to take) today will determine whether our population will stabilize at a more sustainable level or shoot past the 10 billion mark by the end of the century.

There are currently 218 million women in low- and middle-income countries who want to avoid pregnancy but are not using contraception. There are an estimated 30 million unintended births each year in these countries, mostly as a result of this unmet need for family planning. National governments and international donors must step up and fully fund family planning for everyone who wants it. The U.S. fair share of the total figure needed is $1.736 billion — over $1 billion more than our stagnant investment of $607.5 million.

We can’t wait any longer to increase our domestic and international investment in voluntary family planning if we want to improve people’s lives and protect the planet for future generations.

For much of human evolution, our ancestors were exposed to large climatic fluctuations between ice ages and intermittent warmer periods. The last of these ice ages ended about 10,000 years ago.

Before the ice sheets melted, sea levels were about 400 feet (120 meters) lower than today. That allowed humans to migrate around the world. Everywhere they went, our ancestors reshaped landscapes, first by clearing forests and then through early agricultural practices that emerged in a number of regions starting just as the last ice age ended.

Paleoclimatologist William Ruddiman has suggested that these early actions—cutting down trees and expanding farming—caused a small initial rise in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. That contributed to a stable climate over the past 10,000 years by counteracting trends of declining carbon dioxide levels that might have triggered another glaciation event.

By reshaping landscapes, our ancestors actively constructed the niches they inhabited. This process is an important aspect of evolutionary change, creating important feedback dynamics between evolving species and their environment.

As humans evolved, the demands of the growing population, associated knowledge creation and energy use created a feedback cycle my colleagues and I call the Anthropocene engine. That engine has transformed the planet.

Revving up the Anthropocene engine

The Anthropocene engine has been running for at least 8,000 years. It led to the rise of modern civilizations and ultimately to the environmental challenges we face today, including climate change.

How does the Anthropocene engine work?

First, populations had to reach a critical number of people to successfully create enough knowledge about their environments that they could begin to actively and purposefully transform the niches they lived in.

Successful agriculture was the product of such knowledge. In turn, agriculture increased the amount of energy available to these early societies.

More energy supports more people. More people led to early settlements and, later, to cities. This allowed for task specialization and division of labor, which, in turn, accelerated the creation of more knowledge, which increased available energy and allowed population size to grow as well. And so on, and so on.

While the details of this process differ around the world, they are all driven by the same Anthropocene engine.

The problem of exponential growth

As an evolutionary biologist and historian of science, I have studied the evolution of knowledge and complexity for over three decades and have been developing mathematical models with colleagues to help explain these processes. Using the universality of the underlying processes driving the Anthropocene engine, we can capture these dynamics in the form of a growth equation, which includes links between population growth and increasing energy use.

One consequence of positive feedback cycles in dynamical systems is that they lead to exponential growth.

Exponential growth can start very slowly and be barely noticeable for quite some time. But eventually it will have dramatic consequences wherever resources are limited.

Driven by the Anthropocene engine, human population has grown exponentially, and individual societies have approached collapse multiple times over the past 8,000 years. The disappearance of the Easter Island civilization and the collapse of the Mayan empire, for example, have been linked to the depletion of environmental resources as populations rose. The dramatic decline of the European population during the Black Death in the 1300s was a direct consequence of crowded and unsanitary living conditions that facilitated the spread of Yersenia pestis, or plague.

Biologist Paul Ehrlich warned about unchecked growth in his 1968 book ""The Population Bomb,"" predicting growing global demand for limited resources would lead to societal collapse without changes in human consumption.

But globally, humanity has always found a way to avoid doom. Knowledge-based innovations, such as the Green Revolution—the broad-scale effects of which Ehrlich did not foresee—have enabled people to reset the clock, leading to more cycles of innovation and (almost) collapse.

One example is the sequence of energy regimes. It started with wood and animal power. Then came coal, oil and gas.

Fossil fuels powered the Industrial Revolution, and with it, greater wealth and advances in health care. But the age of fossil fuels has had dramatic consequences. It almost doubled the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in less than 300 years, causing the unprecedented speed of global warming that humanity is experiencing today.

At the same time, inequality has become endemic. Poorer nations that contributed little to climate change are suffering the most from global warming, while just 20 wealthier countries are responsible for about 80% of emissions.

The next energy transition to avoid collapse is underway now with the rise of renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. But studies—including a report released ahead of the 2022 U.N. Climate Change Conference in November—show humans aren't evolving their energy use fast enough to keep climate change in check.

Using knowledge to reset the cycle again

Every species, if left unchecked, would grow exponentially. But species are subject to constraints—or negative feedback mechanisms—such as predators and limited food supplies.

The Anthropocene engine has allowed humans to emancipate ourselves from many of the negative feedback mechanisms that otherwise would have kept the population's growth in check. We intensified food production, developed trade among regions and discovered medications to survive diseases.

Where does this leave humanity now? Are we approaching inevitable collapse from climate change of our own making, or can we transition again and discover innovations that reset the cycle?

Introducing negative feedback into our socioeconomic-technical systems—not as radical population control or war, but in the form of norms, values and regulations on excess greenhouse gas emissions—can help keep climate change in check.

Humanity can use knowledge to keep itself within its environmental boundaries.

The only way we can exit this climate crisis, and avoid an accelerating disaster, is by launching an urgent system-wide transformation of our economies and societies. But still, as the 2022 edition of the United Nations Environment Programme’s (UNEP) “Emissions Gap Report” shows, countries are not stepping up.

At the Glasgow climate summit last year, known as COP26, nations signed up to a statement calling for climate pledges that would bring deeper and faster cuts to greenhouse gas emissions. Did this happen? The answer is a resounding “no.” Collectively, updated pledges since COP26 shave less than 1 percent off projected emissions for 2030. The gap between where emissions need to be in 2030 to meet the Paris Agreement goals and where they are predicted to be in that year remains huge.

This leaves us heading for a 2.4 to 2.8 degrees Celsius increase in temperatures by 2100, depending on whether we analyze unconditional national climate commitments, conditional national climate commitments or current policies. Right now, we are in a world at 1.1 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures. Just look at what this brought to Pakistan recently: an apocalyptic flood and over 30 million people impacted. Temperature rises in the range this report predicts won’t give us once-in-a-century floods in Pakistan. They will give us annual floods, storms and heatwaves across the globe. They will give us dying ecosystems and species. They will give us more hunger, more thirst, more migration, more pain.

To avoid this future, we need to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. To get on track to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, we need to cut 45 percent off the greenhouse gas emissions that we can expect in 2030 based on policies currently in place. To hold global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius, the challenge is still significant: 30 percent by 2030. Beyond 2030, emissions must continue to decline rapidly to avoid exhausting the remaining atmospheric carbon budget.

If we are serious about getting this done, we need to kick start a system-wide transformation, right now.

In the electricity supply, industry, transport and buildings sectors, we need to avoid locking in new fossil fuel-intensive infrastructure. We need to advance zero-carbon technologies, market structures and planning for a just transformation. We need to apply zero-emission technology and behavioural changes to sustain reductions to eventually reach zero emissions.

In food systems, we must act on the protection of natural ecosystems, dietary changes, improvements in food production and the decarbonization of food supply chains, while securing food security for all. Action in these four areas can reduce predicted 2050 food systems emissions to around one-third of current levels.

The financial system must become an enabler, rather than a barrier, to the transformation to a low-carbon economy, which requires annual investments of at least $4 trillion to $6 trillion USD per year. This is a relatively small (1.5 to 2 percent) share of total financial assets managed, but significant (20 to 28 percent) in terms of additional annual resources needed. Delivering such funding will require making financial markets more efficient, introducing carbon pricing, creating markets for low-carbon technology through shifting financial flows, mobilizing central banks and much more.

Many people will say this can’t be done over the next eight years. I say we must try. Even if we don’t get there by 2030, every fraction of a degree matters to vulnerable communities, endangered species and ecosystems—and eventually to our own livelihoods. We will be setting up a carbon-neutral future: one that will allow us to bring down temperature overshoots and deliver many other social and environmental benefits, like clean air, green jobs and universal energy access.

Many people will also say that we are too busy dealing with other crises to transform our economies. I say these other crises are opportunities to reform our economies. We have missed the chance to invest significantly in a low-carbon recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, we are in danger of missing the closing window to boost clean and efficient energy as a response to the energy crisis. Instead of missing such opportunities, we must capitalize on them with confidence.

I urge every nation, every government, to pore over the solutions in this report and build them into their climate commitments. I urge the private sector to start reworking their practices. I urge every investor, public and private, to put their capital toward a net-zero world. This is the only way to kick-start a system-wide transformation across the globe. And it is the only way to shed the shroud of greenhouse gases that is slowly baking our planet and putting humanity’s future in jeopardy."
9ce9ff15-30a2-4a6d-9972-031465593740,"Extreme weather events have ravaged every continent on Earth since world leaders last gathered to address the existential threat of climate change.

A new Climate Council report chronicles the succession of disasters that have struck since last November's global climate summit in Scotland.

It's sobering reading as leaders prepare to meet again from Sunday, this time in the Egyptian city of Sharm el-Sheikh.

""Europe sweltered through its hottest summer on record. Parts of East Africa endured unrelenting drought while other parts of the continent suffered deadly floods,"" says Climate Council senior researcher Simon Bradshaw, who wrote the report.

""Many parts of Asia suffered record heat waves, and Pakistan has suffered one of the world's worst ever flooding disasters.

""Here in Australia, we are still in the midst of our costliest ever flood disaster, as affected communities anxiously look ahead to predictions of a wet summer.""

Dr Bradshaw says the confronting list of disasters shows what's at stake if the nations of the world fail to act with the urgency required.

Just last week, the United Nations warned existing pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions would lead to at least 2.5C of warming - a level deemed catastrophic by scientists.

That's far beyond the Paris climate pact's ambition to limit warming to well below 2C, preferably to 1.5C.

In 2019, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said carbon emissions needed to fall by 43 per cent by 2030, but current plans show the world is on track for a rise of 10.6 per cent instead.

Dr Bradshaw says Australia can finally shake off its climate-laggard reputation after the Labor government passed laws enshrining its intention to cut emissions by 43 per cent this decade, and reach net zero by 2050.

But he says it's past time to set an end date for fossil fuels, for Australia to end all finance for coal, oil and gas, and fast-track efforts to transform into a clean energy superpower.

Economist Nicki Hutley, a councillor with the Climate Council, says Australia, along with the rest of the world, is living through a new era of severe climate consequences.

""Global commitments are dangerously off track to prevent a climate catastrophe,"" she says.

""COP27 is a chance for world leaders to demonstrate their words are being backed up with concrete actions. If we move fast, Australia can secure huge advantages for its economic interests as well as our national security.""

Former prime minister Scott Morrison got a frosty reception at last year's climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland, when he shrugged off international pressure for Australia do more on emissions.

Instead he turned up with a six-year-old pledge, made back in 2015 when Tony Abbott was in the top job and signed the Paris pact.

Observers say the Australian delegation, to be led by Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen, will get a much warmer reception in Egypt.

But Mr Albanese has ruled out any increase to its 43 per cent by 2030 target.

""We've already advanced our changed policy,"" he said on Wednesday.

""The Glasgow conference was about increased contributions for 2030. The former government failed to do that and it probably would've been better off if they didn't go at all."""

(Reuters) - Gas emissions from the European Union's energy sector have ended more than a year of post-pandemic rises thanks to cleaner power supplies and energy-saving efforts, the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) said on Thursday.

The independent organisation, which studies trends, causes and health impacts of air pollution, said in a report that carbon-dioxide emissions fell 5% in the past three months from the same period last year, with an 8% fall in October, after rising steadily since March 2021.

""The post-COVID rebound in the EU's fossil fuel use and emissions has come to an end in the past few months, due to the growth in clean energy supply led by solar power, and energy saving measures precipitated by the fossil fuel supply crunch,"" said CREA lead analyst Lauri Myllyvirta.

© Reuters/Benoit Tessier FILE PHOTO: A view shows solar panels installed in the ""eco-neighbourhood"" Clichy-Batignolles, one of several new ecological housing developments with low energy use and carbon emissions, in Paris

""Clean energy investments and policies have expanded dramatically, which will lead to a sustained and accelerated fall in emissions in the next years.""

Europe's emissions had risen from March 2021 as economies recovered from pandemic, the report said, while an underperformance of nuclear and hydropower, together with electricity demand during heat waves in the summer, drove up demand for fossil fuel power.

Hydropower generation is now closer to historical averages, and nuclear underperformance should recover, easing Europe's reliance on pollutants, it said.

France's EDF expects to get most of its nuclear fleet back from maintenance in early 2023 while Germany has extended the operation of its three remaining reactors to April 2023.

Myllyvirta said that the increase in power-sector emissions up to August cannot be attributed to policies favouring coal, as there was no shift from gas to coal in the fuel mix for thermal power generation in 2022.

World leaders are expected to discuss increasing clean energy production facilities in emerging countries during the annual United Nations climate summit in Egypt from Sunday.

Thousands of acres of the Nile River Delta, an important farming area in Egypt, could be underwater by the end of the century, according to a new scientific report. The country’s leaders, who are hosting the COP27 climate change summit this month, hope other nations will help them avoid this disaster.

A quarter of the delta, which is on Egypt’s northern coast on the Mediterranean Sea, sits at or below sea level. A water-level increase of between 1 to 2 feet is likely by 2100, according to a recent report by an international group of scientists overseen by the Cyprus Institute’s climate and atmosphere research center and the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry. That rise will make thousands of acres unfit for living or farming, partly because of added salt from the seawater.

Egypt’s leaders have said the situation of the delta, known for 1,000 years for its fertile soil, is their biggest concern. Residents hope for help from the global community to deal with the consequences of a warming planet.

The delta covers roughly 93 square miles, starting just north of the capital of Cairo where the Nile River fans out. The river’s branches created the rich, fertile land by depositing silt as they made their way to the sea. Silt is fine sand, clay or other material.

The area is home to some 40 percent of Egypt’s 104 million people and accounts for half of the country’s economy, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization. Farms and fisheries along the two Nile branches, Rosetta in the west and Damietta in the east, help feed the country and provide products for export.

Farmers there have tried to save the land from rising seas by bringing in tons of soil, raising beds and using fertilizer to undo damage from salt.

On a September afternoon, a half-dozen farmers sat near a machine pumping water from an irrigation canal onto raised beds in a mango farm in Mutubas. The trees have just started to blossom, next year could be their first harvest.

Ouf el-Zoughby, one of the farmers, said this is his third time trying to grow mangos. Past attempts have been spoiled by salt.

“You see the tree dying before your eyes,” the farmer said, remembering how he had to pull the husks out one-by-one. His fields are within 1.8 miles of the Mediterranean.

This time, he’s hoping the newly elevated farmlands and a government-built runoff system meant to reduce salt in the soil will help them survive.

Mohamed Abdel-Atty, Egypt’s former minister of water resources and irrigation, said in January that the government had installed concrete barriers on 74 miles along the Mediterranean coast to shelter 17 million people. Abdel-Atty said they were also working to build a warning system to alert people about any climate changes such as rises in sea levels.

Authorities are also trying to put a stop to high-polluting practices, such as brickmaking and the burning of rice straw, which is an old farming custom.

But there’s understanding from Egyptians that this is a small step in tackling a global problem.

“Though Egypt contributes 0.6 percent of the global carbon dioxide emissions, it is one of the most vulnerable [countries] to the impacts of climate change, and the agriculture sector and food production are the most affected,” said Abdel Monem, a senior adviser on land and climate change with the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization.

fdd5f1d3-350f-4324-9b61-c4d816d82359,"PARIS (Reuters) - World wine production in 2022 is expected to dip slightly below last year's level, with a better than anticipated volume in drought-hit Europe mostly offsetting a forecast drop in southern hemisphere output, an intergovernmental wine body said.

In initial projections this year, the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV) pegged world production at between 257.5 million and 262.3 million hectolitres (mhl), with a mid‑range estimate at 259.9 mhl.

That would be around 1% lower compared with an estimated 2021 volume of 262 mhl and below the average of the past 20 years, the OIV said in a note.

A hectolitre is the equivalent of 133 standard wine bottles.

""Overall, in 2022 the dry and hot conditions observed across different regions of the world have led to early harvests and average volumes,"" it said. ""Nonetheless an overall good quality is expected.""

In Europe, rain at the end of summer helped to limit the impact of drought in Italy and France, the world's two biggest producers, although heatwaves damaged prospects in Spain, the number three producer.

European Union output was forecast at 157 mhl, up 2% from last year, with the OIV echoing previous projections that anticipated a stable volume in Italy, a sharp rebound in France after a poor 2021 harvest, and a decline in Spain.

For the United States, the world's fourth-biggest wine producer, the 2022 volume was seen down 4% from last year and 6% under the five-year average, reflecting the effects of frost followed by summer drought and related water scarcity, the OIV said.

Southern hemisphere production was projected to have fallen 7% from a record level in 2021 following less favourable weather, but it would be in line with the five-year average.

The OIV cautioned that it did not have 2022 data for China and Russia, but anticipated a structural decline in Chinese production would continue.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Climate change and the Russia-Ukraine war are squeezing global sales and production in the $300 billion global wine industry, which is still recovering from the pandemic, said the International Organization of Vine and Wine (OIV).

Pau Roca, Director General of the OIV, which comprises 49 producing countries, said firms must adapt to droughts, frosts and heavy rain produced by global warming, as they have become regular phenomena.

""We continue to see the effects of climate change,"" Roca told Reuters on Wednesday in Mexico, underlining that in 2022 global wine production will fall slightly due to poor weather in Europe, home to top producers Italy, France and Spain.

""We have a long history that confirms that climate change is having an enormous and constant impact on the wine sector,"" said the 64-year-old Spaniard, who is visiting Mexico for the 43rd World Congress of Vine and Wine.

OIV production's forecast for 2022 is between 257.5 and 262.3 million hectoliters (Mhl), or 259.9 Mhl on average, down 1% from 2021 and below the average of the last 20 years.

Last year, Spain exported 24.2 million euros worth of wine to Russia and 16.2 million euros to Ukraine. This year that total will fall to almost zero, Roca said.

""There's a complete disruption in the markets,"" he said.

The executive said the wine industry is suffering more from the energy crisis sparked by the conflict, with higher inflation sapping consumer spending.

Pau said imports of European wine to the United States have recovered since then-President Donald Trump in 2019 imposed tariffs on the drink that were lifted in mid-2021.

Now big wine producers want to expand in the U.S. market, where per capita consumption is still low, Pau said.

""It has a very significant growth potential"", he said.

ab46c74c-aa78-43e7-9358-9a2775745f89,"Barbados Prime Minister Mia Amor Mottley spoke passionately to the United Nations General Assembly in September about the mounting debt many developing countries are shouldering and its increasing impact on their ability to thrive.

The average debt for low- and middle-income countries, excluding China, reached 42% of their gross national income in 2020, up from 26% in 2011. For countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, the annual payments just to service that debt averaged 30% of their total exports.

At the same time, these countries are facing a “triple crisis of climate change, of pandemic and indeed now the conflict that is leading to the inflationary pressures that lead regrettably to people taking circumstances into their own hands,” Mottley said.

Rising borrowing costs coupled with high inflation and slow economic growth have left developing countries like hers in a difficult position when it comes to climate change. High debt payments mean countries have fewer resources for mitigating and adapting to climate change. Yet climate change is increasing their vulnerability, and that can raise their sovereign risk, increasing the cost of borrowing. Declining productive capacity and tax base can lead to higher debt risks. It’s a vicious cycle.

As one solution, countries and international organizations are talking about “debt-for-climate swaps” to help tackle both problems at the same time. U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed mentioned debt-for-climate swaps ahead of the November 2022 U.N. Climate Change Conference as one option for refinancing countries’ “crippling” debt.

How debt swaps work

Debt-for-climate swaps allow countries to reduce their debt obligations in exchange for a commitment to finance domestic climate projects with the freed-up financial resources.

They have been used since the late 1980s to preserve the environment and address the liquidity crisis in developing countries, including Bolivia, Costa Rica and Belize. These are commonly known as “debt-for-nature swaps.”

Belize, for example, was able to lower its debt in exchange for committing to designate 30% of its marine areas as protected areas and to spend $US4 million a year for the next two decades on marine conservation under a complex debt-for-nature swap.

The swap, organized in 2021 by The Nature Conservancy, involves the U.S.-based environmental group lending funds at a low-interest rate to Belize to buy back $553 million in commercial debt at a deep discount of 45%. The Nature Conservancy raised funds from the investment bank Credit Swisse via the issuance of “blue bonds” backed by the U.S. government, which gave the bonds a strong investment-grade credit rating.

Similarly, Costa Rica has carried out two debt-for-nature swaps with the United States. Under the swaps, Costa Rica agreed to allocate $53 million for conservation projects. It has already planted more than 60,000 trees and reversed its deforestation.

While debt-for-nature swaps have been used mostly for conservation, the same concept could be expanded to climate change mitigation and adaptation activities, such as building solar farms or sea walls. Some finance experts have suggested that debt-for-climate swaps could be structured in a way that could also encourage private-sector bond holders to exchange the national debt they hold for carbon offsets.

Three keys to successful debt-for-climate swaps

I work with the Climate Policy Lab at the Fletcher School at Tufts University. Our experience with debt swaps offers lessons for the design and implementation of debt-for-climate swaps.

First, the complex governance structures of debt swaps have limited their use. In the past, transactions were generally small, generating only about $1 billion in funding for the environment from 1987 to 2003. A term sheet template for future debt-for-climate swaps could reduce the complexity and lower the time and costs involved.

Second, debt-for-climate swaps would need to relieve enough of the debt burden to allow debtor countries to invest in climate adaptation and mitigation projects. For instance, the U.S. created debt-for-nature swaps with Indonesia in 2009 that were criticized for not doing enough to help the Indonesian government achieve its conservation goals.

Another concern is known as “additionality” – ensuring that the swaps lead to additional climate efforts, as opposed to covering efforts already planned or already paid for with international climate finance.

With widening gaps between the amount of adaptation assistance reaching countries and the amount they need, debt-for-climate swaps can be a meaningful source of funding. Climate Policy Initiative, a nonprofit research group, recently estimated that about 90% of the adaptation needs countries listed in their Nationally Determined Contributions – the climate change plans they submit to the U.N. – can be only met with help from development banks or other countries.

Regions experimenting with debt swaps

A few regions are testing debt-for-climate swaps.

The Economic and Social Commission for Western Africa has developed a Climate/Sustainable Development Goal Debt Swap, in which it functions as a liaison between creditors and seven pilot countries. The initiative focuses on advancing sustainable development and climate goals, such as developing more resilient agriculture.

Similarly, as part of the Caribbean Resilience Fund, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean plans to launch a Debt for Climate Adaptation Swap. It aims to reduce the $527 million of debt in three pilot countries by issuing green bonds, similar to Belize’s debt swap. Development banks would play a crucial role by guaranteeing new bonds and reducing the credit risk.

With carefully designed debt-for-climate swaps and support from international institutions, developing countries could expand their finance for desperately needed climate mitigation and adaptation actions and remove some of their heavy debt burden."
cc980d62-59b0-42be-9e6f-1c10a0fd5196,"You may be hearing the phrase “loss and damage” in the coming weeks as government leaders meet in Egypt for the 2022 U.N. Climate Change Conference.

It refers to the costs, both economic and physical, that developing countries are facing from climate change impacts. Many of the world’s most climate-vulnerable countries have done little to cause climate change, yet they are experiencing extreme heat waves, floods and other climate-related disasters. They want wealthier nations – historically the biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions – to pay for the harm.

A powerful example is Pakistan, where extreme rainfall on the heels of a glacier-melting heat wave flooded nearly one-third of the country in the summer of 2022.

The flooding turned Pakistan’s farm fields into miles-wide lakes that stranded communities for weeks. More than 1,700 people died, millions lost their homes and livelihoods, and more than 4 million acres of crops and orchards, as well as livestock, drowned or were damaged. This was followed by a surge in malaria cases as mosquitoes bred in the stagnant water.

Pakistan contributes only about 1% of the global greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change. But greenhouse gases don’t stay within national borders – emissions anywhere affect the global climate. A warming climate intensifies rainfall, and studies suggest climate change may have increased Pakistan’s rainfall intensity by as much as 50%.

The question of payments for loss and damage has been a long-standing point of negotiation at United Nations climate conferences, held nearly every year since 1995, but there has been little progress toward including a financial mechanism for loss and damage in international climate agreements.

Many developing countries are looking to this year’s conference, COP27, as a crucial moment for making progress on establishing that formal mechanism.

Africa’s climate conference

With Egypt hosting this year’s U.N. climate conference, it’s not surprising that loss and damage will take center stage.

Countries in Africa have some of the lowest national greenhouse gas emissions, and yet the continent is home to many of the world’s most climate-vulnerable countries.

To deal with climate change, these countries – many of them among the world’s poorest – will have to invest in adaptation measures, such as seawalls, climate-smart agriculture and infrastructure that’s more resilient to high heat and extreme storms. The UN Environment Program’s Adaptation Gap Report, released Nov. 3, 2022, found that developing countries need five to 10 times more international adaptation finance than wealthier countries are providing.

When climate disasters strike, countries also need more financial help to cover relief efforts, infrastructure repairs and recovery. This is loss and damage.

Egypt is emphasizing the need for wealthy countries to make more progress on providing financial support for both adaptation and loss and damage.

Climate injustice and loss and damage

The conversation on loss and damage is inherently about equity. It evokes the question: Why should countries that have done little to cause global warming be responsible for the damage resulting from the emissions of wealthy countries?

That also makes it contentious. Negotiators know that the idea of payments for loss and damage has the potential to lead to further discussions about financial compensation for historical injustices, such as slavery in the United States or colonial exploitation by European powers.

At COP26, held in 2021 in Glasgow, Scotland, negotiators made progress on some key issues, such as stronger emissions targets and pledges to double adaptation finance for developing countries. But COP26 was seen as a disappointment by advocates trying to establish a financial mechanism for wealthier nations to provide finance for loss and damage in developing countries.

What a formal mechanism might look like

The lack of resolution at COP26, combined with Egypt’s commitment to focus on financing for adaptation and loss and damage, means the issue will be on the table this year.

The nonprofit Center for Climate and Energy Solutions expects discussions to focus on institutional arrangements for the Santiago Network for Loss and Damage, which focuses on providing technical assistance to help developing countries minimize loss and damage; and on fine-tuning the Glasgow Dialogue, a formal process developed in 2021 to bring countries together to discuss funding for loss and damage.

The V20 group of finance ministers, representing 58 countries highly vulnerable to climate change, and the G-7 group of wealthy nations also reached an agreement in October 2022 on a financial mechanism called the Global Shield Against Climate Risks. The Global Shield is focused on providing risk insurance and rapid financial assistance to countries after disasters, but it’s unclear how it will fit into the international discussions. Some groups have raised concerns that relying on insurance systems can overlook the poorest people and distract from the larger discussion of establishing a dedicated fund for loss and damage.

Two elements of developed countries’ reluctance to formalize a loss and damage mechanism involve how to determine which countries or communities are eligible for compensation and what the limitations of such a mechanism would be.

What would a threshold for loss and damage eligibility look like? Limiting countries or communities from receiving compensation for loss and damage based on their current emissions or gross domestic product could become a problematic and complicated process. Most experts recommend determining eligibility based on climate vulnerability, but this can also prove difficult.

How will world leaders respond?

Over a decade ago, developed countries committed to provide US$100 billion per year to fund adaptation and mitigation in developing countries. But they have been slow to meet that commitment, and it does not cover the damages from the climate impacts the world is already seeing today.

Establishing a loss and damage mechanism is considered one avenue to provide recourse for global climate injustice. All eyes will be on Egypt Nov. 6-18, 2022, to see how world leaders respond.

05429fbf-831e-4c1e-ad71-061b1462e4ad,"Next week's COP27 climate meeting in Egypt is likely to feature intense clashes between industrialized nations and developing countries over climate damage costs.

Why it matters: Failure to move forward on a financing mechanism for what the UN calls ""loss and damage"" — compensation for vulnerable nations that are being hit hardest by climate change might make for a failed summit.

The big picture: COP27 is supposed to be the ""implementation summit,"" where pledges on everything from reducing deforestation to boosting funding for adaptation, climate mitigation and cutting methane emissions are turned into actions.

Developing countries, which at COP27 will be led by flood-ravaged Pakistan, have signaled that they will push hard for a financing ""mechanism"" for loss and damage.

This compensation is supposed to address impacts that were caused mainly by emissions from industrialized nations, and that are beyond poorer countries' capacity to adapt.

Such impacts will be at the forefront at COP27, particularly the devastating flooding that swept across Pakistan and the ongoing drought and looming famine in the Horn of Africa.

The intrigue: Industrialized nations, including the U.S. and EU countries, plan to support the discussion of loss and damage in the wake of last year's COP26 summit. However, they are skittish about committing to a specific way of paying for it.

That stance will come under pressure in Sharm el-Sheikh, as developing countries seek specific funding arrangements given how quickly climate disasters are ratcheting up in scope, severity and frequency.

""We need actual money,"" Avinash Persaud, special envoy to Barbados prime minister Mia Mottley, told reporters on Tuesday.

Ani Dasgupta, president and CEO of the World Resources Institute, during a press conference Tuesday, said commitments and real progress on loss and damage would be ""the litmus test for this COP.""

Reality check: Loss and damage is sometimes referred to as ""climate reparations,"" and has been under debate in the UN climate talks since their start in the early 1990s.

The issue is rooted in the disparate impacts of climate change around the world, with a relatively small group of countries — roughly the G20 nations — responsible for most of the warming-related impacts we're experiencing today.

Much of the developing world, particularly in Africa, the small island nations in the Pacific and South Asia are extremely vulnerable to climate disasters, despite having played little role in causing them.

A long-running concern among industrialized nations is that a loss and damage mechanism could be equated with establishing legal liability for causing climate damages.

The big question: Will countries feel more of an incentive to cooperate on climate at this summit, or less?

Between the lines: The clash may be bitter, given that western nations have fallen short on other funding commitments.

A 2009 promise of $100 billion per year for developing country climate aid has not fully materialized.

In addition, the prospect of a Republican House and possibly Senate means that the likelihood of future high dollar commitments from the U.S. are likely to be viewed skeptically.

The U.S. and other industrialized countries have committed to doubling climate adaptation funding, but have yet to follow through.

through. Even celebrated new partnerships to help transition developing economies away from carbon-intensive coal are turning out to need more funding.

The bottom line: Still, COP27 is likely to wrestle with whether and how to operationalize the concept with a focus and determination that no COP has before it."
e175b168-2829-44a6-9ccb-56b8fe05a72d,"This year, thousands of people died and millions lost their homes in devastating floods in Bangladesh, Sudan and Pakistan. In East Africa, 50 million people are experiencing famine caused by the worst drought in 40 years. Around the world, at least half of the 59 million internal migrants in 2021 were displaced by the effects of climate change, according to the United Nations.

This is loss and damage — irreversible climate-related devastation that cannot be mitigated or adapted to. Dealing with it is pushing developing countries into ever-greater debt and their economies to the brink of collapse. The African Development Bank reported in September that the continent is losing between 5% and 15% of its growth in gross domestic product per capita each year because of climate change.

As the chair of the Least Developed Countries Group on Climate Change, I represent 46 nations that are home to nearly one billion people. This month, I will be among those calling on governments to establish a loss-and-damage fund for developing countries during COP27, the 27th Conference of the Parties to UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. Research estimates that US$290 billion to US$580 billion per year will be needed by 2030.

The broken $100-billion promise of climate finance – and how to fix it

The people and communities I represent are those least responsible for carbon dioxide emissions — collectively contributing just 1.1% of global emissions in 2019. That’s less than half the emissions from cars and light trucks in the United States alone. We are hit first and worst by climate change and are least equipped to respond.

Those most responsible for global warming also have the greatest capacity to take action. Although the world’s richest 10% of people cause 50% of emissions, they also claim 52 % of the world’s wealth; the poorest 50% contribute around 10% of global emissions and receive about 8% of global income. Negotiators like me have been demanding action for 30 years.

So where is the concrete support for the people and communities worst affected? Last year, at COP26 in Glasgow, UK, low- and middle-income countries jointly proposed a Loss and Damage Finance Facility. Wealthy countries rejected this, and instead offered a three-year ‘dialogue’. Talk does not feed the starving or shelter the homeless.

Quite apart from the moral imperative — the ‘polluter pays’ principle — rich nations stand to gain from stabilizing the most vulnerable economies. The wealthiest benefit hugely from outflows of capital and commodities from the poorest: think interest payments on debt, or gold and other natural resources.

Limits to adaptation

High-income countries used to claim that loss and damage could be dealt with by adapting to the expected effects of drought, sea-level rise, flooding, heat and disease. It is true that there are (underfunded) mechanisms in the international climate architecture to finance some low-carbon development — renewables, say — and adaptation, such as flood defences. And it is indeed essential for the lowest-income countries to invest in resilience and renewable energy to navigate our rapidly warming world.

So why create a new fund for climate disaster support? Because when your house has been swept away, you need somewhere to sleep and something to eat, not money earmarked for wetland regeneration. As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s alarming report in February indicated, change is happening faster than many communities can adapt to.

We are often told that humanitarian aid and development finance already provide what we are calling for. But such support — although crucial — is neither enough nor reliable. In the past five years, UN humanitarian aid appeals related to extreme weather events raised only half the money needed from donor countries, according to an analysis by international charity Oxfam.

‘COP26 hasn’t solved the problem’: scientists react to UN climate deal

Or we’re told that initiatives outside the UNFCCC aiming to ‘climate proof’ communities can address our needs. Naturally, we appreciate every such initiative. Early-warning systems, one focus, can save lives. Yet, early-warning systems do not rebuild homes or regrow crops. Insurance, another focus, can provide resources when needed — provided you can afford the premium, which is set to rise as impacts worsen, and as long as insurance remains available for risks such as flooding, fires and droughts, which continue to grow in frequency and certainty.

Here’s the irony: global fossil-fuel subsidies from 2021 alone reached US$697 billion. That could pay for the climate-related economic losses suffered by the most vulnerable countries from 2000 to 2019 and still have US$170 billion in profits left over.

So, what do I want to come away from COP27 with? Two things: first, a plan for the commitment made in Glasgow to at least double adaptation finance by 2025 through a system of public grants. Second, the establishment of a loss-and-damage finance facility with an equitable governing body, disbursing new funds. Ultimately, it is every country’s own choice how to secure the funding needed to support the most vulnerable. Creative funding sources could be explored, such as special drawing rights, or a carbon-damages tax on fossil-fuel companies. Debt cancellation can also usefully free up fiscal space. The fund should enact a clear way to identify funding needs and a fast track for emergencies. When your home is destroyed by climate change, do you want to be left to fend for yourself?"

From unprecedented heatwaves across the world, torrential rains and severe flooding in Pakistan affecting millions of people, there is no denying that climate change is a major threat to racialised and marginalised communities across the world. These communities are often located in polluted environments that have a negative impact on their wellbeing.

Student or retired? Then this plan is for you.

Moreover, the Global South is disproportionately experiencing the impact of rising temperatures fuelling environmental degradation, natural disasters, weather extremes, food and water insecurity, economic disruption and conflict.

For too long, the link between the disproportionate impact of environmental destruction, colonialism and economic exploitation, have been ignored by governments in Europe and the rest of the global North.

On Sunday (6 November), Egypt will host the 27th COP summit, building on previous ambitions.

For the first time, the EU is facing pressure to soften its resistance to compensate the world's poorest nations for the loss and damage created by floods, rising seas and other impacts fuelled by the climate crisis.

Launched just ahead of this discussion, the Equinox Initiative for Racial Justice and other organisations call on European leaders to address the ongoing impact of colonialism and exploitation through the ""loss and damages"" approach.

Here are five ways the EU can compensate communities and nations affected by climate change.

First, take historical responsibility for the CO2 emissions in the atmosphere. One commonality shared by many former colonies excessively impacted by climate change is a relatively small carbon footprint. European countries are historically responsible for 22 percent of global CO2 emissions. Yet, in contrast, the historical contribution from African countries, many of whom were former colonies, are merely three percent combined.

Loss and damages are not theoretical or future problems, but a reality that impacts racialised and marginalised communities across the world, particularly in the Global South.

The past is not in the past

Second, acknowledge the colonial exploitation of countries. European colonialism refers to the act of exploiting land and resources on which others are already dependent. Resource extraction such as oil and gas results in extinction, deforestation and pollution. Take the Niger Delta, one of the most polluted places on earth due to the negligence of British company Shell. It is estimated over 17.5 million litres of oil have been spilled there, killing entire ecosystems, uprooting families and causing irreversible damage.

The Global North has also used the Global South as a place to dispose of its waste that is not wanted. Such actions disrupted local communities living on the lands as well as devastated ecosystems.

For the first time, a recent 2022 report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), listed colonialism as a driver of the climate crisis and an ongoing issue that is exacerbating communities' vulnerability to it.

This emphasises the urgency for Global North governments to take historical responsibility to account for such imbalance. They have a duty to allocate the funding that comes from excess profits of gas and oil corporations responsible for climate change to those nations that once were and still are exploited.

Third, give compensation for more than loss of lives, infrastructure and land.

Individuals, communities and nations affected directly by climate change have suffered in unimaginable ways. Many have lost lives or loved ones, homes and jobs as well as land.

Those that have ""survived"" must continue on through a disrupted different way of life: for many, this means displacement, family separation and shattered cultural practices. Any financial decision relating to loss and damage needs to take this into account.

Fourth — recognise that 'adaptation' has limits. Nations and communities have developed adaptation solutions and implemented action to respond to the current impacts of climate change as well as prepare for future impacts. However, adaptation has its limits and no amount of resilience can hinder the material effects of climate change.

The EU should institute a separate financial mechanism addressing loss and damages in addition to existing adaptation and mitigation commitments.

143 million people with nowhere to go

Fifth, and finally, facilitate the inevitable migration. The accelerating trend of global displacement related to climate impacts is increasing cross-border movements, particularly where climate change interacts with conflict and violence.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reports that in 2019, 24.9 million people were displaced in 140 countries by weather-related hazards, and that without sufficient action the number will only continue to grow.

It is expected that over the next 30 years, 143 million people will be uprooted by rising seas, drought, searing temperatures and other climate catastrophes, according to IPCC's 2022 report.

Migration is inevitable as the world heats up. The EU needs to implement a migration policy that prioritises safe passage for all people, including those forcibly displaced due to environmental damages, and save lives by shortening complicated asylum procedures.

Understanding the links between racial justice and environmental harm is essential for the EU to implement effective commitments. These must be reflected in their policies related to the climate crisis.

It is about time that communities and nations directly affected by climate change are compensated by the world's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases. The European Union (EU) should lead by example to make this happen and commit adequate loss and damage financing at COP27."

Pollution from developed countries set climate change in motion. But it’s the countries left behind by industrialization that are feeling the heat. Now, those poorer nations are demanding what’s known in the climate debate as “loss and damage” -- financial and technological help to cope with problems they didn’t cause. It’s an issue that could dominate the global climate talks set for November in Egypt.

1. What is ‘loss and damage’?

Shorthand for a program of climate compensation. The phrase refers to the “loss” of lives, cultures or species that can never return, and the “damage” to vital infrastructure that needs to be repaired after climate-driven disasters. Low-lying developing countries are already bearing the cost and want the largest polluters to make them whole. The aim is a global agreement that would amount to an insurance program paid for by developed nations to poorer nations most affected but least responsible. A recent string of extraordinary disasters, such as this summer’s flooding in Pakistan, which left a third of the country flooded for weeks, have brought urgency to the debate.

2. Why is ‘loss and damage’ so controversial?

Because it requires an implicit admission of responsibility by rich countries -- and paying a lot of money. There is no official cost estimate, but Pakistan’s floods alone inflicted $30 billion in damage since the end of August; researchers have estimated that climate change made peak rainfall there 75% more intense than it would have been without climate change. Money is likely to be central to disagreements at the COP27 United Nations-sponsored talks scheduled for Sharm El Sheik, a resort in Egypt. But even the most generous estimates of what such a deal might involve, reaching many billions of dollars, would likely cover a small portion of what’s needed.

3. What else is involved in the talks?

A lot. Besides discussions of technology transfers, there are questions of agreeing on a common baseline for climate measures, demands for transparent accounting of expenditures, the need for an ethical framework and much else. Any one of these issues might pose difficulty to a real-time negotiation among almost 200 countries; together they are a challenge of enormous complexity. Even when domestic politics allow a rich country to send loss and damage aid abroad, these donor countries might require more robust accounting and oversight than recipients might be willing to accept.

4. Where does the debate stand?

Calls for a “loss and damage” program date to the early 1990s, but have only gotten significant attention in recent years. At the 2021 UN talks in Glasgow, developing countries pushed for a formal process to dispatch assistance where it’s needed. They failed. Negotiators at the COP27 talks will take up the debate again. The conversation is moving quickly, with the US and EU agreeing in principle to formally negotiate loss and damage in Egypt.

5. Could this lead to big payouts?

It could, but could also lead to big promises with little follow through, not for the first time: Developed countries had already committed to raising $100 billion in climate finance a year by 2020, and haven’t come close to that yet. There’s also the competition between loss and damage requests and the vast spending being proposed for basic economic development, to speed the transition to a clean energy economy and to prepare for a harsher climate. “If it becomes just liability and compensation and reparations or something, that’s not going to advance the dialogue,” John Kerry, the US special envoy on climate, said in October, stressing that there needs to be more spending on development and climate adaptation.

7f4f96a2-f755-4c0b-9c65-3751370511c4,"For months conservative politicians and commentators in Australia and around the globe have been desperate to link the world’s energy crisis to policies to get greenhouse gas emissions to net zero.

By blaming the energy crisis on net zero policies, commentators have laid the fears and suffering of people around the world at the feet of climate advocates, the UN and any government with even the most moderate climate goals.

Some have screamed an “apocalypse” is coming if Australia pushes for net zero, pointing to Europe’s energy crisis as a harbinger of the supposed doom to come.

But last week, those famous greenies at the International Energy Agency – the world’s most influential energy policy organisation – tried to put those arguments to bed.

In its annual World Energy Outlook, the IEA’s executive director, Fatih Birol, wrote: “Faster clean energy transitions would have helped to moderate the impact of this crisis, and they represent the best way out of it.”

Despite energy analysts saying rising power costs in Australia – and around the world – are due to the cost of gas and coal on international markets, conservatives have consistently made a link to net zero policies.

Last month in the Australian, Nick Cater, the executive director of the Liberal party-aligned Menzies Research Centre, wrote that the cost of energy had gone up “in every country” that had tried to move away from fossil fuels, even before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

On an almost daily basis, the Nationals senator and former resources minister Matt Canavan links net zero policies to the pain caused by rising energy costs.

The Liberal leader, Peter Dutton, said in his budget reply speech last week that in Europe “countries are rationing power” and electricity and gas bills were “spiralling out of control”, with pensioners and low-income families having to choose between paying power bills and eating.

According to Dutton, this was “not only because of the invasion of Ukraine, but because governments in several countries in recent years have made catastrophic energy decisions” and had turned off generators “before the technology and system are ready for more renewable energy”.

So what does the IEA have to say on all this?

Birol said analysis for the agency’s report should “dispel some of the mistaken and misleading ideas” that the current crisis “is somehow a clean energy crisis”.

“That is simply not true. The world is struggling with too little clean energy, not too much,” he wrote.

“When people misleadingly blame climate and clean energy for today’s crisis, what they are doing – whether they mean to or not – is shifting attention away from the real cause: Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.”

Experts have told this column that it is the spiralling costs of gas and coal that have underpinned rising prices here, because Australia’s power prices are linked to global commodity markets.

The IEA said in the most affected regions “higher shares of renewables were correlated with lower electricity prices, and more efficient homes and electrified heat have provided an important buffer for some – but far from enough – consumers”.

Russia is the world’s biggest fossil fuel exporter. As countries looked to source oil, gas and coal from elsewhere, this caused a huge spike in costs that continues to reverberate around the globe.

But costs had been rising even before Putin’s invasion.

“Climate policies were blamed in some quarters for contributing to the initial run‐up in prices, but it is difficult to argue that they played a significant role,” the IEA report said.

“In fact, more rapid deployment of clean energy sources and technologies would have helped to protect consumers and mitigate some of the upward pressure on fuel prices.”

The report listed a host of factors contributing to rising prices, including the speed of the economic rebound from the pandemic, droughts in Brazil cutting hydropower, heatwaves in France cutting nuclear output, flooding affecting Australian coal production, and failures by governments to introduce policies to increase clean energy investments.

But could net zero policies have held back investment in fossil fuels? Was this helping to drive up prices even further?

There was, the IEA said, “scant evidence to support the notion that net zero emissions pledges have stifled traditional investments in supply, as these pledges are not yet correlated with changes in fossil fuel spending”.

In 68 countries and the EU where net zero pledges did exist, the IEA analysis showed, fossil fuel investments were at similar levels to 2016.

Changes in investment levels in net zero countries in more recent years were “not noticeably different” from those countries with net zero pledges.

What is the likelihood that the IEA’s report prompted conservatives to pull the plug on their anti-net zero rhetoric? Not likely at all.

Safeguard scheming

“Emission impossible” read the headline on page one of the Daily Telegraph on Thursday, with a story claiming “tens of thousands of jobs” were at risk from the Albanese government’s revamp of a failed Morrison government emissions reduction policy.

The story finds four company submissions to the government’s consultation process on changes to the safeguard mechanism that complain they may not be able to reduce emissions fast enough to avoid paying a penalty under the scheme.

Glencore – predominantly a coalminer – complains some of its facilities may have to close (considering how all analysis shows coal’s days are numbered as the world decarbonises, this is hardly a shock). Alcoa, BlueScope and Opal express doubts they can cut emissions fast enough.

But what the story doesn’t mention is the government’s $15bn national reconstruction fund or the $1.9bn Powering the Regions fund that are, in part, designed to advance technologies to cut emissions in sectors like this.

Nor does it mention that Glencore, Bluescope and Alcoa all have net zero targets by 2050.

Mining giant BHP, with 17 facilities in the safeguard scheme, sees little problem with reaching the targets under the scheme, according to its submission.

Not mentioned by the Daily Telegraph either is that the safeguard mechanism – covering the 215 biggest polluting facilities – was introduced by the Coalition and designed to eventually cut emissions from heavy industry. So far it has failed.

Industrial emissions went up under the Coalition as many companies were allowed to have their pollution limits raised without penalty."
539791ca-7285-4482-a71a-84e1c3edbac5,"Paul Ekins is laughing but he’s clearly also rattled. “I have to hand it to Australians,” says the professor of resources and environment policy at University College London. “You always deliver the most shocking news in such an entertaining way.”

For the past 20 minutes, I have been standing at the lectern at Oxford’s Queen’s College, scrolling through slides featuring the supposedly “carbon neutral” claims made by Australian fossil fuel companies and products.

Most of the people in the room are, like Ekins, veterans of climate policy and research. I doubted anything I would say could shock them. But as I worked through the presentation, I realised I was wrong. In front of me, as I explained how these claims were enabled in Australia, I was met by disbelieving looks.

To be clear, fossil fuel companies everywhere promote themselves as climate leaders. The difference here, and the news that stunned this room, is that in Australia the government is not only in on this game, but it is also running it.

Despite Australia’s commitment to net zero by 2050, there are more than 100 new fossil fuel projects in development nationally. Just as committed to gas and coal expansion as industry, but with its own net-zero target to meet, the Australian government provides an entire policy framework under which misleading climate claims thrive. Creative accounting, offsets and their misuse have been nationalised in Australia, amounting to state-sponsored greenwashing.

“A carbon neutral oil and gas company?” asks Clemens Kaupa, an assistant law professor at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. “No, that’s ridiculous.”

Kaupa is referring to a claim by fossil fuel company Cooper Energy that it is Australia’s “first carbon neutral gas producer”.

Kaupa has particular expertise in this area. Last year, he and his students successfully filed a greenwashing complaint against Shell’s “carbon neutral” petrol with the Netherlands’ advertising watchdog. Shell was subsequently required to stop using the term “carbon neutral” to describe its products.

The Netherlands accepts it is not physically possible for fossil fuels to be “carbon neutral”, but in Australia carbon neutral petrol is considered a legitimate premise. In fact, Australia’s own advertising watchdog last month dismissed a similar complaint against Ampol’s promotion of “carbon neutral” petrol.

According to Kaupa, Ampol’s advertisement would likely be found misleading in the Netherlands: Shell and Ampol’s products, and the standards used to assess the claims, are the same. Yet one product has been deemed greenwash and the other not. What may explain the difference is that, internationally, most companies making carbon neutral claims are doing so voluntarily. In Australia, Ampol’s petrol has been endorsed by the government through its carbon neutral certification scheme Climate Active.

Despite Australia’s commitment to net zero by 2050, there are more than 100 new fossil fuel projects in development nationally.

Ampol achieved its certification by calculating the greenhouse gas emissions from extracting, refining and combusting petrol and then offering customers the opportunity to offset the emissions from the petrol they buy. Not all Ampol’s petrol is carbon neutral, nor is it offsetting the emissions from the rest of the company. To date, Ampol has reported purchasing about 80,000 offsets. The emissions from Ampol’s products in 2021 were 41 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, or CO2-e, with the company’s total emissions being 54 million tonnes CO2-e. CO2-e is a way of measuring greenhouse gases from different sources using a single unit, to calculate their global warming potential.

Companies such as Cooper Energy, which make the bolder claim of being a “carbon neutral organisation”, use a different technique, choosing to offset the emissions only from their business operations (4000 tonnes of CO2-e in 2021), including business travel and office stationery, while carving off the emissions that come from actually burning their fossil fuel products (close to a million tonnes of CO2-e). Cooper Energy is accounting for less than 1 per cent of its emissions here and also plans to dramatically increase its gas production through to 2030 and beyond.

Ignoring the role fossil fuel companies have and continue to play in the climate crisis, Climate Active endorses the companies it certifies as having gone “beyond standard practice and set themselves apart as climate champions”. Among these companies is Australia’s biggest polluter, AGL.

“AGL has been Climate Active certified since 2020,” says Harriet Kater, climate lead (Australia) at the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, “and its investors, customers and the wider community would all agree the company has been the very opposite of a climate champion over the last two years.”

The Australian government doesn’t just rubberstamp carbon neutral claims; it provides a ready supply of carbon offsets that industry can use to underpin them. Yet the Emissions Reduction Fund – the framework generating these offsets – has been beset by controversy. Experts suggest about 75 per cent of the offsets are junk and are, in fact, not offsetting anything. Ampol uses Australian carbon offsets that are currently the subject of an independent review.

Beyond Climate Active, corporate claims of carbon neutrality and net-zero climate targets generally are growing rapidly in Australia. Last year, the number of listed companies in Australia making net-zero commitments doubled. Despite this growth, emissions from burning fossil fuels in Australia continue to increase, demonstrating a clear disconnect between pledged and actual climate action.

Rising emissions are unsurprising when industry greenwashing appears to be so rampant. The interpretation of climate ambition by the private sector varies greatly and has resulted in climate claims that make it virtually impossible to distinguish who is actually acting in good faith and who is not.

Australia’s financial regulators have finally acknowledged the confusion and risk this landscape poses to consumers and investors. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Australian Securities and Investments Commission and Australian Prudential Regulation Authority have all announced a crackdown on greenwashing in the past year. The ACCC’s chair, Gina Cass-Gottlieb, has flagged that as many as 42 per cent of green claims in Australia may be fraudulent or misleading. ASIC’s deputy chair, Karen Chester, told members of parliament this month that the financial regulator was already carrying out investigations in response to a reported uptick in greenwashing. “ASIC’s job there,” Chester says, “is to have a look at that and say: ‘That’s very interesting. You show us how you’re going to achieve that…’ ”

While such announcements may comfort investors and consumers, what is unclear is how successful efforts by government regulators will be, given that it is the Australian government itself giving a tick of approval to misleading claims and providing the offsets and accounting frameworks used by industry to mislead. Experts fear Australia’s regulators will be unable to successfully tackle greenwashing when the system is broadly functioning as it was intended to.

When Cooper Energy makes a carbon neutral claim, it doesn’t just protect its social licence, it also protects the government subsidising gas expansion while simultaneously reassuring fire- and flood-stricken communities that they are taking climate change seriously.

Kirsty Ruddock, a managing lawyer at the Environmental Defenders Office, who filed the complaint about Ampol on behalf of activist group Comms Declare, says: “It is no accident that a fossil fuel company in Australia can claim to be a carbon neutral organisation at the same time as telling shareholders it will be ramping up oil and gas production. This is the result of policy design and an absence of environmental standards.”

Although the rhetoric of climate policy has shifted significantly since the Morrison government lost office, the reality is Australia’s commitment to fossil fuel expansion hasn’t shifted at all. The Australian government has set the standard for the likes of Ampol and Cooper Energy to continue polluting for decades with the help of creative climate accounting and offsets rather than actual decarbonisation.

Labor promised a slightly more ambitious emission reduction target for 2030 than the former Coalition government, but its increase in ambition is at odds with its ongoing support for gas and coal. Labor has refused to block new fossil fuel projects and has not ruled out the billions in subsidies that go to fossil fuels every year. The government’s key climate policy, the revived Safeguard Mechanism, places no requirements on industry to reduce emissions. It is based around allowing them to offset emissions instead.

Greenwashing is not new in Australia, but the last election has made it more important. Labor’s more ambitious rhetoric, and its promise not to introduce either a carbon price or a ban on new fossil fuel projects, makes the gap between rhetoric and reality even wider than it was for the Coalition.

The jumbled relics of policy architecture set up by previous governments, including the Safeguard Mechanism, the Emissions Reduction Fund, creative accounting frameworks and, of course, Climate Active, form the basis of the state-sponsored greenwash being used to avoid the political pain and economic shifts that will be inevitable with genuine decarbonisation.

As countless corporate failures have shown, however, creative accounting can delay the inevitable but not defeat it. If the world is to succeed in its goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, Australia must fail in its goal of increasing fossil fuel production and exports. Carbon neutral petrol and gas companies might make for good short-term optics, but they do nothing to prepare Australia for long-term reality.

3c0e9a61-e34c-481b-a30c-8d013da69415,"The majority of Australians are worried about climate change, with concern over floods and bushfires at record highs, according to the latest Climate of the Nation report.

The annual survey, managed by progressive think tank the Australia Institute, found most Australians believe governments are not doing enough to prepare for and adapt to the impacts of climate change.

The think tank polled about 2600 adults over 12 days in August.

It said the results showed Australians are frustrated at energy companies and want a speedy transition to a zero-emissions economy.

Costs set to soar

Natural and climate-related disasters cost the Australian economy $38 billion annually.

This is expected to rise to $73 billion by 2060.

Half the population believe that fossil fuel producers should foot the bill for responding to climate change, survey results show.

“Australians are fed up with the mismanagement of the country’s natural resource wealth and want a windfall profits tax on the gas industry and a levy on our fossil fuel exports to help pay for climate-related disasters,” director of climate and energy for the Australia Institute, Richie Merzian said.

The survey shows that 80 per cent of Australians believe climate change is occurring, with younger people more likely to be on board than their elders.

The top three concerns are:

More droughts and flooding affecting crop production and food supply (83 per cent)

More bushfires (83 per cent)

Animal and plant species becoming extinct (80 per cent).

This is unsurprising, given recent devastating floods and the Black Summer bushfires of 2019-20.

Energy misconceptions

Australians overestimate the size of gas and oil industry employment by a factor of 58, the report found.

Voters estimate that, on average, 9.7 per cent of the workforce is engaged in oil and gas extraction when the industry only employs 0.2 per cent of the Australian workforce.

We also overestimate coal mining employment as a proportion of total employment – by a factor of 33.

Australians believe the coal mining industry makes up 10 per cent of the entire workforce, when it makes up just 0.3 per cent.

Despite this, the majority still want to stop new gas and coal mines, and three-quarters (73 per cent) want a “well-planned” and “co-ordinated” phase-out of coal mining.

Fossil fuels and tax

Australians also believe that the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax (PRRT), the main way the Australian government collects revenue from oil and gas exploration and mining, contributed 11 per cent to the federal budget for the 2021-22 year.

In reality, the PRRT contributed just 0.3 per cent.

Only 8 per cent of those surveyed do not want fossil fuel subsidy money spent elsewhere (like health care, cost of living and climate action).

And 62 per cent of Australians support a levy on fossil fuel exports to help local governments respond to climate change.

Getting on track

Australians want more than just the replacement of fossil-fuelled cars with electric vehicles.

“Australians believe the government should help shift away from car use towards public transportation, cycling and walking,” Mr Merzian said.

“The upcoming electric vehicle strategy is an opportunity to get moving on fuel efficiency standards, targeted electric vehicles subsidies, and a phase out of fossil-fuelled vehicles – all of which have strong public support.”

Electric vehicle policies are popular, including government subsidies, charging infrastructure and registration and stamp duty discounts.

Two-thirds (64 per cent) of Australians support requiring all new car sales in Australia to be zero-emissions vehicles by 2035.

And 62 per cent support a national subsidy scheme for bikes, e-bikes and cargo bikes.

“[Australians] want better infrastructure for active transport, subsidies for e-bikes and cargo bikes, and an all-electric Australian bus fleet,” Mr Merzian said.

International aspirations

Energy Minister Chris Bowen heads off to Egypt this week for the world’s largest annual climate conference, the United Nations Conference of the Parties (COP).

Mr Bowen can feel confident that most Australians want the nation to be a world leader in climate action, with two-thirds of Australians wanting to host a COP event in the future.

But Mr Merzian said Australia will struggle to be taken credibly as a clean energy export superpower while it “remains a fossil fuel export superpower”.

“Australia’s fossil fuel resources have been exploited at the expense

of the local environment and global climate, but it is mostly

foreign-owned companies – not the Australian public – that have

benefited,” he said.

“Australians are dealing with the high-cost consequences of relying on gas and coal power. Three-quarters want the government to step in and plan the shift to renewables and storage.”"
254937ff-e328-4912-8a0b-a34956b30d7c,"Australians want more from governments on climate change as record floods and extreme weather wreak havoc across the eastern states.

A landmark report released on Thursday shows record levels of concern and strong support for higher taxes on fossil fuels.

The Climate of the Nation Report, which has been tracking public opinion on climate change for 15 years, also reveals a growing frustration at energy companies and a strong appetite to transition away from gas and coal-fired power.

Despite new climate laws locking in carbon emission reduction targets for 2030 and 2050, most Australians surveyed want governments to do more to prepare for climate damage and to stop new sources of pollution.

Three-quarters (75 per cent) are concerned about climate change, with the number of those ""very concerned"" continuing to increase year on year, the Australia Institute report found.

Some 83 per cent of Australians are concerned climate change will result in more bushfires, and that droughts and floods will affect crop production and food supplies.

Four in five (80 per cent) back a ""climate trigger"" for the environment minister to knock back future fossil fuel projects.

Almost two-thirds (61 per cent) support a windfall, or one-off, profits tax on the oil and gas industry, as companies profit from high energy prices sparked by war in Ukraine.

Support for a new tax is broad, with majority support across age, state, gender and voting intentions.

Almost two-thirds (62 per cent) support a levy on fossil fuel exports to help local governments respond to the cost of climate change.

Institute spokesman and former climate negotiator Richie Merzian said opportunities from the energy transition are recognised by many Australians.

Most agree that tackling climate change will create opportunities, jobs, and investment in regional Australia, and they support vocational training and industry support.

But the data also shows Australians are ""fed up with the mismanagement of the country's natural resource wealth"", he said.

""Australians are dealing with the high-cost consequences of relying on gas and coal power and three quarters want the government to step in and plan the shift to renewables and storage,"" he said.

More than two thirds of Australians want the country to host international climate negotiations.

Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen will lead Australia's delegation at the United Nations climate negotiations in Cairo next week to spruik his new policies and clean energy ambition, while Prime Minister Anthony Albanese will skip the event.

Mr Merzian, who will be at the climate talks representing the independent institute, said Australia would struggle to be credible as a ""clean energy export superpower"" while a leading exporter of gas and coal."
31b6ca21-98d8-4cb6-8c14-d5e94d8e626e,"COP27 is the 27th Conference of the Parties (countries) that signed up to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The convention was established at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, and has been ratified by 198 countries. They agreed to stabilise the production of greenhouse gases in order to prevent dangerous climate change.

Since then, the Conference of the Parties has been hosted in a different country each year. These conferences broadly provide a platform for the negotiation of international climate change treaties.

Read more: COP27: what to expect

The very first treaty acknowledged that the responsibility for action was different for developed and developing countries, because developed countries were responsible for most greenhouse gas emissions.

Despite some gains, commitment to these treaties has not translated into the action necessary to shift the course of global climate change. The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report states that global average temperatures have already reached 1.1°C above pre-industrial levels and that warming of over 1.5°C is all but inevitable unless drastic action is taken.

Everyone is affected by climate change, but some people and regions are more vulnerable than others. Regions that will experience the most adverse impacts of climate change are West, Central and East Africa, South Asia, Central and South America, Small Island Developing States and the Arctic. Populations living in informal settlements will have the worst of it.

Vulnerability to climate change impacts is driven by socioeconomic, political and environmental factors. African countries have already experienced loss and damage due to climate change. For example, food production, economic output and biodiversity have all declined and more people are at risk of dying due to climate change in African countries.

The COP27 is therefore important because that is where decisions are made about how to respond to climate change.

Climate change treaties

Three international treaties have been adopted on international climate change cooperation. They led to the development of different bodies which all convene under the banner of the COP. COP is where they meet, negotiate and evaluate progress, even though COP technically only refers to the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.

The first treaty was the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.

The second was the Kyoto Protocol, established in 1997. Countries made commitments to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases. The Kyoto Protocol was based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. It acknowledged that because of their higher levels of economic development, developed countries could and should take greater responsibility to reduce emissions.

The third and most recent treaty is the 2015 Paris Agreement. It covers climate change mitigation, adaptation and financing and aims to limit the rise in temperatures to less than 2°C above pre-industrial levels. All signatories need to develop a non-binding plan for climate change mitigation, including reducing emissions. They also have to report on progress.

A key weakness of the Paris Agreement is that it is non-binding. Also, the commitments are self-determined. A recent study found that even if all countries did meet their commitments, it would not be enough to limit warming to below 2°C.

It is important to understand and engage in these processes as the impacts of climate change are increasing globally. The increase in the global average temperature is one of several climate impacts. Others include increased likelihood of droughts or floods, and increased intensity of storms and wildfires.

The frequency of climate events will increase as temperatures rise. There is an urgent need for action to prevent global warming from rising above 2°C. Temperatures over 2°C will result in irreversible climate impacts such as sea level rise, and affect far more people than an increase of 1.5°C.

Responses to climate change

There are three policy areas which have emerged to respond to climate change.

The first is mitigation – the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to stabilise the climate. Examples of mitigation include replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources, or developing electrified public transport to replace private vehicles powered by combustion engines.

The second is adaptation – interventions which would support climate resilience and reduce vulnerability. Examples include improved water management and conservation to reduce risk of drought, initiatives to improve food security and support for biodiversity.

The last policy area deals with loss and damage. Loss and damage refers to “the economic and non-economic damages associated with slow onset events and extreme weather events caused by global warming and the tools and institutions that identify and mitigate such risks.” Interventions to address loss and damage can include risk management support and finance which is often framed as climate reparations.

Mitigation and adaptation are well understood and established within climate policy. And they have finance mechanisms within international treaties, even though existing commitments to these mechanisms have not materialised in practice, particularly when it comes to adaptation. Loss and damage, however, has received far less attention in international treaties and negotiations.

Highlighting loss and damage

The Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage was established in 2013 to provide a framework to address loss and damage. It aims to improve understanding of risk management approaches, increase coordination and dialogue among stakeholders and enhance action and support.

The issue of loss and damage was incorporated into the Paris Agreement, but without any specific commitments around it. During negotiations at COP25, the Santiago Network was set up to avert, minimise and address loss and damage for developing countries but it focuses mostly on technical assistance rather than finance. At COP26 (in 2021) there was an agreement to fund the Santiago Network, but the institutional framework is not yet finalised.

Loss and damage was raised as an important issue to be addressed during COP26. There were some promising moves, such as the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, pledging £2 million towards a loss and damage finance facility. But many rich nations did not support this.

The negotiations led to the proposal to establish the Glasgow Finance Facility for loss and damage. But the wording of the decision was changed at the last minute to the Glasgow Dialogues, which committed to discussing arrangements for funding activities to avert, minimise and address loss and damage. This change has delayed any real financial support for loss and damage in the short term.

This was very disappointing for developing country parties, who will be pushing once more to secure financing for loss and damage at COP27, and holding other countries to account for the US$100 billion annual commitment towards climate finance which has yet to materialise.

Many climate activists from the global south feel that if a financing facility for loss and damage is not discussed at COP27, it will be a failed conference."

The world must rapidly decarbonise to avoid the most dangerous climate change harms. World leaders know this. But that knowledge must urgently turn into concrete commitments and plans.

If humanity continues on its current path, we’re going to leave a hotter, deadlier world for the children of today and all future generations.

Earth desperately needs COP27 to succeed. I’m a climate scientist and I believe world leaders should have these three things top-of-mind heading into the conference.

Read more: Almost 200 nations are set to tackle climate change at COP27 in Egypt. Is this just a talkfest, or does the meeting actually matter?

1. Our planet is undeniably in crisis

So far, Earth has warmed just over 1℃ relative to pre-industrial levels, meaning we’ve already damaged the climate system. Our greenhouse gas emissions have already caused sea level to rise, sea ice to shrink and the ocean to become more acidic.

Extreme events in recent years – particularly heatwaves – have the fingerprints of climate change all over them. The record-smashing heat in western North America in 2021 saw massive wildfires and straining infrastructure. And earlier this year, temperatures in the United Kingdom reached a deadly 40℃ for the first time on record.

The ocean, too, has suffered a succession of marine heatwaves that have bleached coral reefs and reduced the diversity of species they host. Heatwaves will worsen as long as we keep warming the planet.

Frighteningly, we risk tipping the climate into a dangerous new regime bringing even worse consequences. Research from September finds we’re on the brink of passing five major climate “tipping points”, such as the collapse of Greenland’s ice-sheet. Passing these points will lock the planet into continuing damage to the climate, even if all greenhouse gas emissions cease.

Human health is also on the line. Research last month revealed the climate crisis is undermining public health through, for instance, greater spread of infectious diseases, air pollution and food shortages.

Among its disturbing findings, heat-related deaths in babies under a year old, and adults over 65, increased by 68% in 2017-2021, compared to 2000-2004.

Future generations cannot afford our dithering on action to reduce emissions.

2. Emissions reduction is too slow

Some countries, particularly in Europe, are succeeding in reducing greenhouse gas emissions through transitioning to renewable energy.

But globally it’s not happening fast enough. A UN report this week found if nations deliver on their climate action goals for 2030, Earth will still heat by about 2.5℃ this century - overshooting the Paris Agreement goal to keep global warming well below 2℃.

Such warming would be disastrous, especially in poorer parts of the world that have contributed little to global emissions.

For decades, the world has talked about reducing carbon dioxide emissions. But annual global emissions have risen by over 50% in my lifetime, and since the first COP back in 1992. The UN warns there’s still “no credible pathway” to limiting warming to 1.5℃.

Until we reach close to net-zero emissions, the amount of CO₂ in our atmosphere will rise and the planet will warm. At our current rate, we are warming the planet by about 0.2℃ every decade.

3. The stalling must end

With so many challenges facing the world, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the cost of living crisis, it may be tempting to view climate change as a problem that can wait. This would be a terrible idea.

Climate change will get only worse. Every year of delay makes it much harder to prevent the most dangerous climate projections becoming a reality.

Only concerted efforts from all nations will avoid destroying our most sensitive ecosystems, such as coral reefs. We should be doing everything we can to stop this by transitioning away from fossil fuels. Any new fossil fuel development is just making the problem worse and will cost humanity and the environment far more in future.

And yet, the International Energy Agency last week projected that the net income for oil and gas producers will double in 2022 “to an unprecedented US$4 trillion”, a $2 trillion windfall.

We can’t, as climate activist Greta Thunberg put it, just have more “blah, blah, blah” from world leaders at COP27 - we need concrete action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

What now?

COP27 must lead to a rapid transition away from fossil fuels, including no new fossil fuel developments, and more support for countries dealing with the biggest climate change impacts. We must be on a credible path to reach global net-zero emissions within the next few decades.

The lack of progress at past global climate talks means I’m not optimistic that COP27 will achieve what’s needed. But I hope world leaders will prove me wrong and not let their nations down.

Last fall, at a high-profile global climate summit in Scotland, the countries of the world embraced what seemed like a significant commitment in the quest to combat climate change.

Acknowledging that progress had been too slow, leaders agreed to “revisit and strengthen” their national climate targets if possible over the coming year — rather than waiting every five years, as envisioned under the 2015 Paris climate accord.

Global greenhouse gas emissions

Note: Greenhouse gas emissions are expressed in carbon dioxide equivalent, or CO 2 e, to normalize gases based on their warming potential over 100 years.

The push came as part of the effort to hold average global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, compared with preindustrial levels — a key threshold past which scientists have said disastrous impacts become far more likely.

But as the world prepares to reconvene in Egypt this month for COP27, the annual U.N. climate change conference, almost none of the globe’s biggest emitters have come forward with stronger commitments. Few nations overall have ramped up their ambition, despite another year of floods, fires and other climate-related catastrophes.

“Disappointing,” is how Claire Fyson, co-head of the climate policy team at the nonprofit research group Climate Analytics, describes the lackluster reality. “Few governments have really done anything to substantially move the dial.”

According to the independent Climate Action Tracker, as of Thursday only 21 countries have submitted updated national climate commitments as leaders are set to gather at the summit, which starts Nov. 6 in Egypt — and not even all those newer plans contain more ambitious goals. Meanwhile, another 172 countries have not updated their targets, the group said.

Only one large country so far has filed a plan that includes stronger, credible emissions-cutting commitments: Australia.

“But Australia came from a very, very low baseline,” said Niklas Höhne, a German climatologist who created the Climate Action Tracker. “They have a lot of catching up to do.”

In short, the momentum that emerged at last fall’s summit in Scotland has stalled, as other crises such as the war in Ukraine and rising inflation and energy costs have demanded the attention of world leaders.

The news isn’t all bad.

Earlier this year, the United States passed the Inflation Reduction Act, a major piece of legislation that includes $369 billion in funding related to the climate and energy issues. As a result, U.S. emissions are projected to drop sharply over the coming decade.

Even so, the new legislation alone will not be enough to meet the Biden administration’s pledge to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by at least half by 2030, when compared with 2005 levels. And the pledge is itself insufficient to help hold global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, according to the Climate Action Tracker.

Meanwhile, Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine could prompt the European Union to accelerate its transition toward renewables and away from the fossil fuel-producing countries it has long relied upon for energy.

In a report last week, the Paris-based International Energy Agency found that the invasion, in part, could lead global demand for fossil fuels to peak beginning later this decade.

At the same time, there has been increased focus this year on efforts to ensure that the world’s wealthy nations — and its largest emitters — live up to promises to help smaller, more vulnerable countries deal with the impacts of climate change and build cleaner infrastructure as they grow.

“It’s not all doom and gloom, but it’s definitely not moving fast enough,” Fyson said.

Earth already has warmed at least 1.1. degrees Celsius on average, and many places have warmed by at least 2 degrees (3.6 Fahrenheit) or more.

Earlier this year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that at the current rate of emissions, the world could blaze past the crucial 1.5 degrees Celsius target in less than a decade. And while it’s still technically possible to reverse course, hitting goals that leaders have set “cannot be achieved through incremental change.”

And yet, another year has passed with few signs of the transformational changes needed to bend the world’s current trajectory toward a more sustainable future.

Not only are existing pledges not bold enough to put humanity on track to hit the most lofty goals of the Paris climate accord, but current policies in place in many countries also remain inconsistent with their public pledges to do more.

“There’s still a huge gap left,” Höhne said. “And the targets are still insufficient.”

That sentiment is in line with the findings not only of the Climate Action Tracker, but also of the United Nations itself.

In an annual report published last week, the organization found that despite lofty vows from world leaders, existing climate pledges put the Earth on track to warm by a troubling 2.4 degrees Celsius (4.3 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century. And few countries have undertaken policies necessary to meet even those inadequate targets, the report said.

“Global and national climate commitments are falling pitifully short,” U.N. Secretary General António Guterres said of the findings. “We must close the emissions gap before climate catastrophe closes in on us all.”

Given all that is at stake, and all the suffering that scientists say lies ahead without rapid and far-reaching changes, it seems logical that governments around the planet would act with more urgency and cooperation despite the competing demands of other crises, Höhne said.

“I’ve worked on this for 35 years now,” he said, “and I don’t understand why it doesn’t happen.”

Signs of progress over the past year have moved the world away from the more catastrophic pathways it was on only a few years ago. But as COP27 begins, data show humanity remains on a perilous path."

Floods, fires and natural disasters are standard fixtures in news bulletins.

In the face of this global threat, calls are increasing for the international community to co-operate, find common ground and confront climate change.

COP presents an opportunity to do just that.

What is COP?

‘COP’ stands for Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

It’s a decision-making body for the world’s climate change commitments.

This year’s conference will be the 27th conference – hence the ‘27’.

COP27 begins on Sunday, and will be a fortnight-long series of conferences, talks and discussions between global leaders to flesh out countries’ climate commitments and co-ordinate efforts to combat climate change.

This year’s conference takes place at Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, against a backdrop of extreme weather events worldwide and global instability.

Who will be there?

About 90 world leaders and heads of state will attend the conference.

US President Joe Biden will be there, as will his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Italy’s new Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, will all attend.

However, Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese will sit it out, saying he wants to focus on passing his government’s policies during the final three parliamentary sitting weeks.

Climate Change Minister Chris Bowen, will lead the Australian contingent at the conference.

British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak wasn’t going to attend, but changed his mind after Boris Johnson indicated he was going.

As well as politicians and representatives of national governments, environment defenders, Indigenous spokespeople, climate organisations and fossil fuel lobbyists will also attend.

Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is skipping the event and has been critical of the conference, saying it is a forum for “greenwashing”.

“The COPs are mainly used as an opportunity for leaders and people in power to get attention, using many different kinds of greenwashing,” she said.

“So as it is, the COPs are not really working, unless of course we use them as an opportunity to mobilise.”

There are often barriers that prevent environmental activists from attending or participating fully in discussions.

There are concerns that COP27 may be worse in terms of access because freedom of assembly and freedom of the press are heavily restricted in Egypt.

What will be discussed at COP27?

Expect to hear some hard truths coming out of this year’s conference.

The world is not on track to limit climate change to the levels committed to in the Paris agreement.

The Paris Agreement, reached at COP21 in 2015, saw 195 countries, including Australia, commit to holding global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees.

The world’s leading scientific authority on climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), last week stated that on our current trajectory the world will not limit global warming to 2 degrees because, disturbingly, emissions are still rising.

COP27 is an opportunity for governments and organisations to come together and grapple with a challenge that affects all humanity.

Egypt’s COP27 vision is to move from negotiations and planning to implementation.

Climate finance

Climate finance will be a top theme at COP27.

It is defined as financial assistance rich nations provide to developing nations so they can create clean energy infrastructure, cut emissions, and adapt to the effects of climate change.

In 2009, developed countries committed $100 billion per year in climate finance to developing countries. But this commitment has not been met.

Developing countries are calling for developed countries to meet their obligations to help the most vulnerable communities.

Australia is expected to come under renewed pressure to end fossil fuel financing and to phase out coal and gas use.

Loss and damage

Extreme weather events like floods, fires and cyclones cost countries dearly.

Developing countries are disproportionately affected as these climate-driven disasters intensify and occur more frequently.

Many of these countries have contributed far fewer greenhouse emissions than developed nations.

There is now an urgent need for developed nations to provide finance for loss and damages that can’t be avoided by mitigation or adaptation.

There have been discussions around establishing a loss and damage fund, but it has not been established.

UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and Climate Ian Fry said he is hoping to build further momentum at COP27 to “get it done”.

“There are major developed countries that are quite concerned about it and looking at this issue from the perspective of what the polluter pays. Now, the countries most affected by climate change and suffering the costs are having to deal with those costs themselves.

“So, it’s time the big countries, the major emitters, stood up and said, ‘We’ve got to do something, we’ve got to make a contribution to these vulnerable countries’,” he told UN News.

What’s Australia’s role?

Australia has an important role to play in this year’s conference, independent economist and councillor for the Climate Council, Nicki Hutley, said.

“There’s a really important role for us in terms of helping get that financing structure right so that we can do more to help developing economies,” she said.

“There’s a real role for the finance community … to get together and Australia could be helping lead that conversation.

“We have been a leader in the past in bringing developing finance around the world and helping economies to lift nations up out of poverty … I think we can help to broker those deals.

“We need to really stand up and be counted.”"

World leaders agreed a historic new climate agreement at COP27 in Egypt on Sunday morning.

They have committed to establishing a fund to help countries being impacted by climate change, but they have not raised ambition on cutting emissions.

The agreement comes a year after the Glasgow Climate Pact was signed, which contained new pledges on coal, forests and money.

Progress on these pledges could provide an indication of how likely nations are to succeed in achieving what has just been signed off in Sharm el-Sheikh.

So far, climate experts have told the BBC that progress in 2022 has been slow - with governments around the world distracted by global energy and financial crises.

Last week the UN warned the world is heading towards catastrophe. But there are rays of hope - including fresh US legislation and a change of government in Brazil that could reverse the Amazon rainforest's destruction.

As leaders depart from COP27 in Egypt, we look at seven key players to ask who is leading the way and who is dragging their feet.

USA: A climate leader again?

The US made a huge leap forward this year when it passed sweeping new laws to confront climate change.

Measures within the Inflation Reduction Act could reduce US greenhouse gas emissions - those gases that warm the atmosphere - by 40% by 2030.

""This is the biggest investment in climate solutions in US history. It's a huge sign of progress,"" Dan Lashof, US director at the World Resources Institute, told BBC News.

The bill aims to make green energy the default in major sectors like electricity, transport and industry. The most obvious result for consumers is a tax credit of around $7,500 (£6,500) for those who buy an electric car.

But it is not all good news. In response to the energy crisis, President Joe Biden released 15m barrels of oil from reserves on to the market and approved new leases for oil and gas drilling.

And after a senior US politician controversially visited Taiwan, China ended its co-operation with the US on climate, this has potentially slowed progress on climate action. But there are signs tension could be thawing after US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping held their first meeting since Biden took office at the G20 conference this week.

Story continues

Joe Biden announces the release of 15 million barrels of oil from the US strategic reserve, Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm stands in the background, October 2022.

The US has also not delivered its fair share of finance to support developing countries suffering the most from climate change, which could damage relations at COP27.

UK: Leadership and 'dithering'

The UK hosted COP26, secured major global pledges, and showed itself to be a clear international climate leader.

But the UK has shown ""disappointing"" leadership in the run up to COP27, says Alyssa Gilbert, Director of Policy at Imperial College London's Grantham Institute.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak performed a U-turn from his earlier decision not go to to Egypt due to other priorities - experts say this has compromised the UK.

""One of the key things about COP is political leadership from the top. Dithering from the Prime Minister is worse in a year when we are the presidents of COP,"" explains Ms Gilbert.

Rishi Sunak

And the UK has not increased its ambition to tackle its role in climate change, according to analysis by Climate Action Tracker of plans submitted to the UN. (These are called Nationally Determined Contributions - part of the landmark Paris Agreement in which countries promised to regularly increase ambition to tackle climate change).

The global energy crisis also led the UK to back-track on commitments to end new oil and gas extraction in the North Sea and close down coal-powered stations.

These changes may not fundamentally alter the UK's energy balance - but they ""send the wrong signal"", explains Robert Falkner, professor of International Relations at the London School of Economics.

EU: Squeezed by Russia

The European Union is historically progressive on tackling climate change, but Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the impact on energy supplies to Europe have undermined that.

""Leaders extended the lifeline of coal-fired power plants and and we estimate that European emissions actually increased by about 2% in the first six months of this year,"" says Prof Robert Falkner.

Climate Action Tracker now rates EU's climate targets, policies, and finance as ""insufficient"", and the EU has not updated the UN with new NDC plans.

But Prof Falkner considers the return to investing in fossil fuels a ""temporary setback"" and suggests the EU could take this opportunity to make itself energy secure by investing in renewables.

A new plan, the REPowerEU plan, aims to increase the EU's share of renewable energy in 2030 from 40% to 45%.

India: Big ambitions hampered by coal

India is one of the few countries to have published updated climate targets in 2022.

""It is almost impossible to talk about India without talking about progress,"" says Kamya Choudhary at London School of Economics.

It promises to reduce emissions intensity by 45% by 2030 - meaning it plans to reduce emissions per dollar. It also wants 50% of installed energy to be renewable.

But India's plan to reopen 100 coal mines (coal is the most polluting fossil fuel) could be a barrier to those ambitions.

Professor Navroz Dubash at Centre for Public Policy and UN climate advisor told the BBC that tariffs on coal are helping to pay for key infrastructure, and the loss of that income needs to be plugged.

Workers prepare to load coal at the Jharia coalfield in Dhanbad in India's Jharkhand State

However, as in other countries, Kamya Choudhary suggests this is a short-term measure to cope with the energy crisis.

Climate Action Tracker says India's pledges are not very ambitious - they could be achieved with limited government action.

Brazil: New president, new hope?

Brazil holds one of the keys to fighting climate change - its massive Amazon rainforest, the lungs of the planet, soaks up huge amounts of carbon.

In a dramatic election last week, President Jair Bolsonaro was ousted by Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva - potentially changing overnight the future of the Amazon. ""Brazil is ready to retake its leadership in the fight against the climate crisis,"" Lula said on Sunday.

In 2021 alone deforestation increased by 48%. Renata Piazzon, executive director at Instituto Arapyau, puts this down to President Bolsonaro championing more mining in the Amazon.

President-elect of Brazil Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was one of the most popular attendees at the 27th UN Climate Summit in Egypt this week

Since Glasgow, Brazil's targets have been criticised as ""less ambitious"" than pledges made in 2016, and for failing to meet promises.

Historically, Brazil has used hydropower to provide large amounts of green energy - but a drought in 2021 drained its dams. In response, it invested in oil and gas - with predictions that its use of oil will increase by 70% by 2030.

However, the International Energy Agency predicts that solar will compensate for the loss of the nation's hydropower.

Australia: Making up lost ground

Politics has seen a change of face in Australia too. Elected in May, new Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has accelerated climate plans, ending a decade of backsliding.

The country submitted new targets to the UN, promising to reduce emissions by 43% by 2030 - a big leap forward from its previous target of 26%.

But Bill Hare, CEO of Climate Analytics, says it only seems like significant progress because of how far behind Australia was.

New Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has committed to reversing biodiversity loss in Australia by 2030

""There has been so far been little change in policy and certainly not in the area of fossil fuels,"" he said.

Australia's states have led the way in increasing renewable energy - but the country remains in the top five producers of coal in the world.

And although Australia promised at COP26 to end deforestation, it was classed in 2021 as the only developed country that is a ""hotspot"" for tree loss - nearly half of forests in eastern Australia have been destroyed.

China: A 'terrific' polluter investing in renewables

China has a complicated role in global climate action. Unlike countries in the developed world, it is not responsible for historical greenhouse gas emissions that scientists say have caused climate change so far.

But it is now a ""terrific polluter"" because of its very rapid economic growth, explains Neil Hurst, senior policy fellow for energy and mitigation at the Grantham Institute. It burns half of the coal in the world, and is reluctant to cut back because of energy shortages.

However, China is also by far the biggest investors in renewable energy. A quarter of newly-registered cars in China are electric. ""They're making big efforts and setting demanding targets, including peaking its carbon emissions by 2030,"" explains Mr Hurst.

And it has big ambitions to address carbon emissions with tree planting. In May, President Xi Jinping pledged to plant 70 billion trees by 2030.

Nov 2 (Reuters) - Thousands of businesses will fail to meet pledges to combat climate change unless they start training employees on sustainability, Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) President Brad Smith told Reuters.

Speaking ahead of a report the software maker released Wednesday, Smith said common instruction on issues like carbon accounting was too piecemeal for the roughly 3,900 companies that have vowed to cut their CO2 emissions.

""We have to move very quickly to start to bring our emissions down, and the ultimate bottleneck is the supply of skilled people,"" he said.

Microsoft sells software for organizations to track their environmental impact. Still, companies need more than technology to address global warming, said Smith, announcing plans to develop green education materials including on LinkedIn, which Microsoft owns.

Wednesday's study, by Microsoft and Boston Consulting Group, found that many corporate environmental leaders - 68% - were internal hires whose team members lacked sustainability-related degrees more often than not. The findings primarily stemmed from interviews and surveys with Microsoft and eight other large companies in sectors such as finance and consumer goods.

It took one Microsoft employee, for instance, more than 30 years at the company moving through customer-support, procurement and other roles before a promotion to lead part of its sustainability team - a time horizon the report contrasted with an expected 11 years before humanity will have released a dire amount of carbon dioxide.

While Microsoft itself has grown its sustainability headcount to about 250 employees from only 30 largely in the past three years, having the right workforce to deliver on its carbon-reduction goals remains a challenge, Smith said.

""That is in part an issue for us because it's an issue for everybody,"" he said. ""Employers really need to step back and take a broader look at their investment in employee learning and training.""

Companies should bring in instructors, pay for continuing education and convene on carbon-reduction strategies, he said.

Today Microsoft is publishing a new report, Closing the Sustainability Skills Gap: Helping Businesses Move from Pledges to Progress. Thousands of companies around the world have issued climate pledges – but globally, we don’t currently have the workforce with the necessary skills to move from pledges to progress.

This report represents the culmination of intensive research conducted by Microsoft and Boston Consulting Group (BCG) with roughly 250 employees at 15 companies that are at the forefront of sustainability innovation and change. It highlights the formidable sustainability skilling challenges we must overcome around the world. Even more important, it offers several concrete recommendations, both for business leaders and government policymakers. It leaves us optimistic that this global skilling crisis can be solved with collaboration, data, and global effort.

You can read the foreword I authored below and the report in its entirety here. I want to add a special note of thanks to the 15 companies that participated in this study and especially to the team at BCG. We benefited from the sponsorship of Rich Lesser, the Global Chair of BCG, and two leaders inside BCG who have repeatedly provided indispensable help to me and my team at Microsoft, Derek Kennedy and Simon Bamberger. The project pushed us collectively to think hard about new multi-disciplinary sustainability and skilling frontiers. Making sense of a nascent space is never easy; I hope you’ll find the lessons we’ve crystallized in the final report as useful for you as it has been for me.

###

Foreword

It’s hard to ignore the effects of climate change. In recent weeks, a heavy blanket of smoke from nearby wildfires has enveloped the region I call home, an eerie phenomenon that has become an unfortunate seasonal event in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. At the same time, the American West and parts of Europe are experiencing historic drought. And halfway around the world, Pakistan is recovering from catastrophic summer floods that killed 1,500 people, displaced 33 million more and caused $40 billion in ruin. All devastating events. And all believed to be fueled by climate change.

The gravity of the problem has led more than 3,900 companies, including Microsoft, to announce climate pledges. As we work, internally and with a large majority of these companies, it’s clear that the coming business changes will be massive. They will impact a wide variety of processes and operations, in part based on new applications for digital technology, including cloud services, AI and dedicated services like our Cloud for Sustainability. But, as we’ve learned, this will also require an equally vital effort to equip companies and employees with a broad range of new skills needed for climate adaptation and sustainability transformation.

The historical importance and current breadth of the sustainability skilling challenge are difficult to overstate. A clear analogy has emerged from our study of the issue. Humanity’s initial quest to reach the moon required the spread of physics into a broadly accessible academic discipline across the United States. The world’s entry into the digital age then required that computer science move into every school. In a similar way, the creation of a net zero planet will require that sustainability science spreads into every sector of the economy.

That’s the focus of this report.

During the past year, Microsoft and Boston Consulting Group (BCG) studied the work of 15 companies at the forefront of sustainability innovation and change – including across Microsoft itself. Our teams interviewed or surveyed nearly 250 employees whose jobs have sustainability commitments. We identified new jobs that have emerged. We studied the impact on the many jobs that existed before. And we considered what our data says about in-demand knowledge and skills.

The impact on jobs across companies falls into two broad categories. The first is specialized sustainability positions emerging quickly across the global economy. For example, a company like Microsoft now employs individuals who pursue full time the purchase of long-term, high-quality carbon removal. The second is much broader, as existing jobs expand to encompass sustainability subject matter. A good example involves engineers and materials scientists who design hardware devices. They now have to assess not only the capabilities of materials that go into a new device but also the sustainability implications of those materials.

As companies move to create and fill these jobs, they are confronting a huge sustainability skills gap. This gap encompasses three categories. First, some employees need deep and specialized sustainability knowledge and skills in areas like carbon accounting, carbon removal and ecosystem services valuation. This includes the skills needed to address these issues through new climate-specific digital tools. Second, broader business teams need readier access to more limited but sometimes deep knowledge in specific sustainability subject areas, such as climate-related issues that have become important for procurement and supply chain management. Third, a great many employees need basic and broader fluency in sustainability issues and climate science fields that impact a wide variety of business operations and processes.

Ultimately, it’s important to recognize that the sustainability transformation will need people who can combine specialized sustainability knowledge and skills with varying degrees of other multidisciplinary skill sets. These will need to combine knowledge from STEM and other fields in the liberal arts and encompass skills that span across business, the use of data, and digital technology. This combination currently is hard to find and often doesn’t exist naturally.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, we’ve also learned that the sustainability skills gap is creating an increasing sense of anxiety for business leaders. This reflects not only the enormity of the climate crisis but two other factors as well.

First, there are growing public expectations that companies will turn their climate pledges into progress. In the next 24 months, regulators in multiple countries will likely require that public companies report their carbon emissions. A great many businesses are not yet equipped with the skilled personnel, business processes and data systems needed for this step. Business leaders understandably fear that, if their reports are incomplete or show a lack of progress, they will confront growing public criticism.

Second, this pressure for performance is growing while economic concerns are rising. Economic turbulence is putting added pressure on companies to find new ways to do more with less. In some instances, companies may even be tempted to postpone or forego new business initiatives, including pursuing their climate pledges.

Yet ongoing scientific observations and data show that the world cannot afford to wait. In late October, new reports underscored the need for accelerated action. In particular, the United Nations Environment Programme made clear in its annual Emissions Gap report that current national climate plans fall short of what will be needed to meet the world’s climate targets.

Clearly the business community will need to do more. Other institutions must as well. Climate pledges and performance are equally important for every organization on the planet, including nonprofits and even government institutions themselves. In short, we’re all in this together, and we need to come together to chart a successful path forward, including by investing in sustainability skills.

Yet, today, the gap between sustainability workforce needs and the number of qualified people available is growing. According to the LinkedIn Green Jobs report, green jobs grew at an annual rate of 8% between 2015 and 2021, while the talent pool grew at only 6%.

As these figures reflect, progress is underway, but it’s not moving fast enough. To date, most companies at the forefront of sustainability transformation have been scrappy, growing the “home-grown” talent they need. Our research found that employers so far have tapped 68% of their sustainability leaders by hiring from within their own company. Some 60% of sustainability team members joined without expertise in the field. Employers mostly have tapped talented insiders with the core transformational and functional skill sets needed to create change in a company, even though they lacked formal training in sustainability. They then upskilled those individuals to accomplish critical sustainability work.

The biggest problem with this approach is that it will not scale to meet either the business community’s or the planet’s needs. As we look at the roughly 3,900 companies that have made climate pledges, it’s readily apparent that the work to turn these pledges into progress will require far more talent with sustainability skills and fluency than currently is being trained within these companies’ businesses.

How do we move further and faster?

This is a fundamental question, and we offer in this report both some suggestions and a commitment as a company to do more. Progress will be needed in three areas.

First, we all need to work together to develop a shared understanding, based on better data, regarding evolving jobs and the sustainability knowledge and skills needed for them. Currently, data remains spotty. We need a better and common taxonomy and framework that builds on recent sustainability work by international organizations, national governments, and private companies. As described in our report, we believe sustainability skilling can borrow from recent advances to address cybersecurity skilling to help create a better roadmap linking specific sustainability skills, training, jobs and career paths.

Work will be needed from a broad array of stakeholders. To develop a shared understanding of sustainability workforce needs, Microsoft and LinkedIn will support efforts to define skills and competencies and enable the mapping of sustainability skills and jobs as they evolve. We will achieve this in part through partnerships with organizations like the International Labour Organization and our work with the Development Data Partnership, which includes the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other multilateral organizations.

Second, employers must move quickly to upskill their workforce through learning initiatives focused on sustainability knowledge and skills. This will require support from a variety of learning partners, including educational institutions, vocational education providers, apprenticeship programs and online training providers. This work must start with the development of new learning materials that can be used both in person and online. This must be supported by expanded learning initiatives to reach employees in companies and more broadly across the workforce. There is an opportunity for government policy and funding to help scale these efforts.

To support this work, Microsoft will work with partners to develop and share new sustainability learning materials. These will include LinkedIn Learning paths for sustainability as well as business-focused sustainability materials provided through Microsoft’s Sustainability Learning Center and our Cloud Solution Center. Additionally, we are forming new partnerships with NGOs to help workers, including those in impacted and transitioning communities, to complete sustainability learning pathways. This will include a partnership with INCO Academy to launch a Green Digital Skills course to support up to 10,000 learners, including in the Global South.

We will also work with our customers to create a network and advanced forum to share new learning and best practices to transform sustainability practices and reduce carbon emissions. This will include a new and focused forum for chief sustainability officers.

Third, the world must prepare the next generation of workers for the sustainability jobs of the future. Just as governments, NGOs and companies have worked to bring digital skilling and computer science into schools, we will need similar partnerships to bring sustainability fluency and science into primary and secondary schools. And higher education institutions will need to strengthen and expand their undergraduate and graduate sustainability programs. All these efforts can move faster if governments and public-private partnerships develop stronger sustainability programs through country-level networks and centers of excellence, foster international professional forums and communities of practice, and create real-world interdisciplinary learning opportunities for students.

To support these efforts, Microsoft is committed to creating and providing new curricular and training materials that can be used by primary and secondary students. This will include our new Minecraft Frozen Planet II worlds, which we will present in partnership with BBC Earth at COP27. This adds to the Climate and Sustainability Subject Kit and Sustainability City learning map, available through Minecraft Education. In addition, Microsoft FarmBeats for Students will provide students with a hands-on experience to explore how big data, AI and machine learning apply to real-world sustainability challenges. Finally, we will join UNESCO’s Greening Education Partnership to deliver strong, coordinated action that will empower learners with the skills required for inclusive and sustainable economic development.

Microsoft will also invest in global capacity-building for post-secondary education. This will include a new partnership with the international research collaboration MECCE (Monitoring and Evaluating Climate Communication and Education) Project to support the implementation, monitoring and reporting of sustainability education worldwide. Additionally, we will partner with the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education, providing support to its Centers for Sustainability Across the Curriculum Program.

The start of this decade has seen more than its share of crises, including the COVID pandemic, a war in Europe and growing economic uncertainty. Although we can’t predict when these current challenges will fade, it seems certain that the climate crisis will outlast all of them.

For almost three centuries since the dawn of the industrial revolution, human ingenuity has produced remarkable inventions and unprecedented prosperity for much of the world. But this has come from the use of fossil fuels that have produced carbon emissions at an unsustainable level. Now we must move to a net zero world in which we both seek to eliminate net carbon emissions and expand global economic opportunity. This will require sweeping changes in every sector of the economy in every country in the world. And we must achieve all this in only three decades.

In the history of civilization, few generations have needed to do as much in as little time as we must do now. At its most fundamental level, this is the single greatest challenge and opportunity of our time.

Like the space age and digital era, the world’s sustainability transformation calls not only for a new generation of technology but a new generation of knowledge and skills. Clearly, no single entity can meet this challenge alone. The key will be to partner broadly and effectively with others to move the world’s workforce into the future. We know the proposals in this report don’t have all the answers, but we believe the world must commit to a Global Sustainability Skilling Strategy based on a concerted and coordinated effort from companies, industry organizations, learning providers and governments. And we are committed to doing our part.

f43e2fc5-1ab0-4bf1-a302-027decd44869,"Deloitte Center for Sustainable Progress identifies five ways public policy can support the Green Collar workforce and help vulnerable regions and industries adapt to global decarbonization

NEW YORK, Nov. 2, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- A new Deloitte Center for Sustainable Progress report released today found that more than 800 million jobs—about one-quarter of the global workforce—are highly vulnerable to being disrupted by climate change, from weather extremes to the impacts of transitioning to a low-carbon economy. However, policy makers and business leaders can unleash significant economic growth and help create more than 300 million new jobs around the world by 2050 by building a new Green Collar workforce and making decarbonization work.

Deloitte's latest report, ""Work toward net zero: The rise of the Green Collar workforce in a just transition,"" builds on modeling from Deloitte's Turning Point series to present a more detailed look at the impacts of decarbonization, specifically on jobs. An investment in skills—to create a new Green Collar workforce—is necessary to realize the USD$43 trillion economic dividend identified from coordinated action on climate change. It also explores how policy action to invest in skills development can create a more equitable transition to net-zero globally, creating opportunity and progress.

Deloitte's research found that climate extremes and uncoordinated shifts away from fossil fuels towards renewables can create substantial risks to millions of workers around the world. To identify the jobs most vulnerable to climate change and decarbonization, the Deloitte Economics Institute constructed a new Job Vulnerability Index. This methodology helps pinpoint the regions and industries needing new assistance and policy interventions.

Building a new Green Collar workforce

The economics of the transition to net-zero emissions will both require—and create—a Green Collar workforce, which will be characterized by new types of work, skills and occupation, and will remake our economy of the future.

Story continues

The Deloitte Economics Institute highlights that better economic growth will boost the demand for many existing jobs, while the transformation to decarbonize the economy will see some jobs transformed, with new skills and new categories of jobs being created as technology and new economic markets emerge. The report identifies two categories of types of work that are more exposed to the risks of unmanaged costs from the transition to net-zero and climate change damages—those exposed to physical damages from climate change and those who work in high-emissions intensive industries. This underscores the importance of coordinating around the future of these workers and industries.

""Our analysis shows that 80% of the skills that will be required for jobs in our increasingly decarbonized economy already exist. It's clear that these skills and the Green Collar workforce will be the driver of the transition—not consequence of transition,"" says Dr. Pradeep Philip, Partner, Deloitte Economics Institute. ""With the right policy support from governments globally, we can create more jobs, better outcomes for workers, and a more equitable distribution of the opportunities created in a net-zero economy.""

Ensuring a just transition with public policy

Deloitte's report outlines how proactive public policy can support vulnerable regions, industries, and workers during the transition and build the new industrial complex of the future. The Green Collar workforce policy agenda developed by the Deloitte Economics Institute can serve as a guide to actions decision-makers should consider in order to help industries and workers adapt to global decarbonization.

Create high-value jobs for transition pathways : Employment pathways are required that represent an equivalent or higher quality job opportunity to ensure their living standards and meaningful engagement in work are maintained through the low-carbon transition.

Reform education and training systems : Education and training systems globally will be responsible for upskilling and retraining disrupted workers, in addition to facilitating pathways into high-growth sectors with in-demand skills. Reforming the education and training sector is critical to realizing the economic potential of decarbonization.

Use policy to drive effective skills reallocation : Not all workers, skills, or regions will require the same strategic policy solutions. Taking a portfolio approach will consider workers in the wrong place, with the wrong skills, underutilized workers, and workers that may need a nudge.

Set ambitious emissions reduction targets : Clearly defined reduction targets can help industries, businesses, and individuals make effective investment decisions for a timely and coordinated transition. Getting the timing and scale right is key to an active transition that will leave workers better off and lower transition costs for economies overall.

Take a systems-based approach for new policy: Accelerating progress toward net-zero emissions and tackling our toughest climate challenges will require extraordinary levels of collaboration and coordination across emerging economic systems—from government, finance, and technology.

abf38ac4-9041-4dc5-9b73-ef3dcc4cf44f,"Climate change activists are fighting to bring down carbon emissions by telling people across the world to drive less, turn off lights, and avoid fast fashion. One of the world’s most famous climate activists, Greta Thunberg, went as far as urging people to stop traveling via airplanes to reduce carbon emissions—popularizing “flight shaming.”

Bizarrely, she’s inspired activists from her generation to adopt more and more outlandish protests, such as dumping cans of tomato soup on a Van Gogh or gluing their head to a Vermeer.

But what if the answer isn’t changing people’s behavior but a new type of tech bro? A Microsoft executive says the biggest single problem is there aren’t enough qualified workers to combat climate change.

“We have to move very quickly to start to bring our emissions down, and the ultimate bottleneck is the supply of skilled people,” Microsoft President Brad Smith told Reuters ahead of the company’s report on sustainability skills published on Wednesday.

The report, titled “Closing the Sustainability Skills Gap,” highlights a challenge businesses across the world are facing in their efforts to combat climate change because they do not have enough sustainability-skilled workers to drive the change. Microsoft and Boston Consulting Group interviewed and surveyed 250 employees at 15 companies (including Microsoft) that are at the forefront of sustainability innovation and change.

Over the summer, parts of the world experienced historic droughts and record high temperatures. Meanwhile, Pakistan is still recovering from floods that killed more than a thousand people. These devastating events are all believed to be “fueled by climate change,” Smith said in a foreword to the report. The growing climate crisis has led 3,900 companies to announce pledges to combat climate change, he said.

Companies are working to fill roles focused on sustainability efforts, but there’s a skills gap. Employers need people who have specialized sustainability knowledge and skills needed to address issues through climate-specific digital tools, he said. Some businesses are not yet equipped to handle these challenges, and they’re also facing increasing economic pressures that could lead them to postpone efforts altogether.

The International Labor Organization estimated that 18 million new jobs would be created by 2030 to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement (an international treaty on climate change). But LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills report showed that green jobs grew at an annual rate of 8% between 2015 and 2022—and the talent pool grew by only 6%, according to the report.

Of the sustainability leaders interviewed for the study, 68% were hired internally. And over 40% of sustainability professionals were hired with three or fewer years of experience, and nearly 60% of sustainability managers lacked a degree in a sustainability-related field, according to the report.

“These major companies have relied upon talented insiders with the core transformational and functional skill sets needed to evolve their roles and create change, despite a general lack of formal sustainability training,” the report said.

But there are ways for these companies to fill the skills gap, and the report suggests three recommendations to make progress. First, create a better shared understanding of what the workforce needs by using data. In partnering with other organizations like the International Labor Organization, employers can work to map out sustainability skills and jobs as they evolve, which will improve the data available.

Next, employers should work to upskill their workforce through sustainability training and learning initiatives, which can be done by partnering with educational institutions, the report said.

The last recommendation moves beyond just employers, and rather asks that the next generation of workers are taught sustainability fluency and science in primary and secondary schools. Adding that, higher education institutions should also strengthen and expand their undergraduate and graduate sustainability programs.

“Like the space age and digital era, the world’s sustainability transformation calls not only for a new generation of technology but a new generation of knowledge and skills,” Smith said. “Clearly, no single entity can meet this challenge alone. The key will be to partner broadly and effectively with others to move the world’s workforce into the future.”"

WASHINGTON, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Some forty of the 119 countries that pledged last year to slash emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas methane will unveil their plans to do so at the UN climate summit next week, according to a senior U.S. official.

The outlook reflects modest progress on the U.S. and EU-led Global Methane Pledge, an international side deal to the UN climate talks in which countries promised to reduce methane emissions 30% by 2030 from 2020 levels in a bid to tackle on of the top contributors to near-term planetary warming.

The United States, Canada and Vietnam are among the countries that will put forward details, according to the official in U.S. President Joe Biden's administration, who asked not to be named.

Aside from the United States, it was unclear if any of the world’s other top 10 methane emitters would present plans at the summit, which takes place in Egypt from Nov. 6-18.

The world’s top two largest methane emitters, China and India, are not signatories to the pledge, and other big emitters like Brazil are not expected to have plans in time for the talks.

The plans will outline the countries' regulations, standards and investments in methane reduction and how those strategies fit into their broader climate targets under the 2015 Paris climate agreement to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the U.S. official said.

The United States, for example, is expected to tout its 2021 regulatory proposal to require oil and gas drillers to find and fix methane leaks, and release new details on how it aims to tackle emissions from small oil wells and from flaring.

To date, only 15 countries have published specific targets or detailed national strategies for slashing their methane emissions since signing on to the Global Methane Pledge at the 2021 UN climate summit in Glasgow. Those countries will be among the 40 expected to lay out details at the conference, the official said.

Scientists say sharp cuts in methane emissions from oil and gas extraction to farming and waste management will be a vital lever in tackling climate change, since methane is over 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide in the short-term.

The World Meteorological Organization said last month that last year's jump in methane concentrations was the highest since records began in 1983 and came on the heels of another record-breaking year in 2020.

Meanwhile, the world saw at least two massive releases of methane from oil and gas infrastructure since last December, including from ruptures on the Nord Stream natural gas pipeline system under the Baltic Sea and a major leak from offshore oil and gas fields in Mexican waters of the Gulf of Mexico.

EYE ON CHINA

All eyes will be on the world's biggest methane emitter, China, which had agreed in ajoint declaration with the United States last year to develop a comprehensive national plan to control and reduce emissions, even though it was not party to the Global Methane Pledge.

Official documents and local government climate action plans now include the set phrase ""strengthen the statistical monitoring and emissions control of methane and other non-CO2 greenhouse gases"" and China’s big energy firms are involved in pilot programs to improve monitoring.

""The national methane plan is indeed key to watch. But the Chinese authorities are quite cryptic in terms of whether and when it will be released in the run up to [the COP],"" said Li Shuo, a China expert at Greenpeace.

Climate experts are also concerned that rising tensions between Washington and Beijing over Taiwan and Russia's invasion of Ukraine could undermine joint cooperation on climate change.

Meanwhile, three new countries - Australia, Mongolia and Bangladesh - announced last month that they have joined the Global Methane Pledge, each of which may offer more detail about their plans in Egypt.

Mexico may also outline more details about its methane strategy. State oil firm Pemex recently presented a plan to reduce methane from the oil and gas sector to the government.

Jonathan Banks, global director of methane at the Clean Air Task Force, which is closely tracking country pledges, said the details emerging from countries are a crucial step to dealing with global warming.

""We need to move out of the promises and more towards the action pieces, whether it's sectoral actions or larger actions,"" he said.

Countries are also expected to call for more international funding at the conference to help them tackle methane emissions, the U.S. official and Banks said. Less than 2% of today's climate mitigation investment tackles methane, even though it is a huge driver of climate change, the official said.

bc8fe323-6fe3-4b0d-aedb-b91a9de2dd72,"This week the United Nations published its new Emissions Gap report, showing that government actions announced to date have the world on track to 2.8 degrees of heating. “As today’s report makes clear, we are headed for economy-destroying levels of global heating,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. “We need climate action on all fronts - and we need it now.” The report said updates on government actions since Glasgow would make “negligible difference”. It found only “urgent system-wide transformation” could deliver the enormous cuts needed to limit greenhouse gas emissions by 2030: 45 per cent compared with projections based on policies currently in place to get on track to 1.5 degrees and 30 per cent for two degrees.

In order to secure the support of developing nations that had not enjoyed the economic benefits of burning fossil fuels but were suffering the worst impacts of climate change, developed nations promised in 2009 to supply $US100 billion in finance per year by 2020 to aid in transition from fossil fuels, as well as building societies more resilient to a warming world. The finance was never seen as sufficient for the purpose, but was considered by many developing-world negotiators to be an indication of good faith by wealthy nations. The promise was never kept, with a recent OECD analysis of the years between 2013 and 2020 calculating that the highest amount mobilised was $US83 billion in 2020. The commitment to transition funding was reiterated in Glasgow and will be central to talks hosted by Egypt this year. The hosts have for the first time put an even more controversial demand on the agenda: the call from the developing world not just for financial support in mitigation and transition, but for compensation for loss and damages due to climate catastrophes. A man walks with his buffalo on a road with floodwaters on either side in Dadu, Pakistan, October 22. Credit:Getty Discussions about loss and damage have been long rejected by wealthier nations, which fear accepting culpability for causing climate change.

At the talks in Egypt, held after recent catastrophic floods in Pakistan and Nigeria, record droughts in the Horn of Africa and China, heatwaves over Europe and India and record-breaking hurricanes hitting the United States, negotiators will have to address whether those nations that have historically emitted the most greenhouse gases should have to compensate others. But it’s not all failure and disagreement. America has come to the party, and so has China In August this year the Biden administration finally secured the last vote it needed to pass the biggest ever climate initiative by the world’s largest economy. The so-called Inflation Reduction Act will see almost $US400 billion on clean energy initiatives and transition from fossil fuels. Early analysis suggested that the Act would reduce US greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 40 per cent compared to 2005 levels by 2030.

It is expected that it will have international implications too. “The investments it makes in energy, in technologies, even food systems — those investments actually show how you transition an economy. This is a lesson that India would need, South Africa would need, China would need,” said Ani Dasgupta, chief executive of the climate think tank World Resources Institute. In China too there is progress. Though much attention has been paid to China’s expanding coal fleet, it has also stopped funding international coal infrastructure, knocking 70 per cent of funds out of the global coal pipeline. It is also deploying renewables at eye-watering pace. At present it is installing more renewable energy infrastructure each year than Europe and the United States combined and is on track to beat its own target of having 33 per cent of its energy provided by renewables by 2025. A solar panel installation is seen in Ruicheng County in central China’s Shanxi Province. Credit:AP As international energy analyst Tim Buckley told The Age and the Sydney Morning Herald earlier this year, while China leads the world in coal use, it also leads the world in “wind and solar installation, in wind and solar manufacturing, in electric vehicle production, in batteries, in hydro, in nuclear, in ground heat pumps, in grid transmission and distribution, and in green hydrogen. They literally lead the world in every zero-emissions technology today.”

The Paris Agreement is having a serious impact It may well be that the world is not yet on track to avoiding catastrophic climate change, but the Paris Agreement is having a serious impact. Professor Frank Jotzo, director of the Centre for Climate Economics and Policy at the Australian National University, says that 15 years ago climate scientists believed we were on track for four degrees of warming. The landmark 2006 Stern Review on the economics of climate change prepared for the British government focused on what actions might be taken to hold warming to three degrees because two degrees seemed implausible, he adds. Over recent years global emissions have largely flatlined while populations have grown. This is not enough to maintain a safe and stable climate, says Jotzo, but it suggests that policy driven by the Paris deal is having an impact.

When nations first agreed to set reductions in 2015 under the accord, it was clear those targets were woefully insufficient, which is why the process includes a “ratchet” mechanism which requires signatories to the treaty to regularly increase their ambitions. In the years up to 2025, as nations begin to submit their 2035 targets, we should see projections for warming fall further. “We are in a far better place than we were a few years ago,” says Jotzo. “The largest reason for that is the rise of zero-carbon technologies that are far, far cheaper and much easier to deploy.” Indeed, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the cost of residential solar systems in Australia, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US declined from around US30¢-46¢ per kilowatt-hour in 2010 to just US5¢-24¢ in 2020.

Last year the International Energy Agency (IEA) declared solar to be the cheapest power in human history. But it is climate policy that has accelerated the investment in those technologies and driven down their cost. The end (of fossil fuels) is nigh This week the IEA, historically an organisation with very conservative views on renewable energy, predicted for the first time that oil, coal and gas use are likely to peak near the end of this decade. Crucially it found in its World Energy Outlook - a blockbuster annual report - that the war in Ukraine had hastened the demise of fossil fuels as the world scrambled to reduce use via efficiency measures and the fast deployment of green technology. While predictions of coal’s demise are not new, it is the first time that the longevity of gas has been questioned by the IEA.

“After rapid growth in gas consumption in the last 10 years, we think the golden age of gas is coming to an end,” the IEA’s chief Fatih Birol told The Financial Times. “Together with the decline in coal and oil that we were already expecting, we now see a peak around 2030 for all fossil fuels.” Loading The world is witnessing, he said this week, a historical turning point. Jotzo agrees. While many world governments failed to raise their climate ambitions this year as they focused on security and energy, the policies they adopted to answer those crises are now improving the climate outlook. According to the IEA, as a result of the energy crisis caused by the Ukraine war, new investment in solar, wind and power will rise to $US2 trillion by 2030, a 50 per cent increase."

CAIRO -- Egypt's foreign minister Wednesday urged world leaders and negotiators to deliver on previously made pledges to battle climate change ahead of this month's U.N. summit.

Sameh Shoukry, the president of the COP27 climate change conference to be held in the Egyptian resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh on Nov. 6-18, said participants should aim to take “meaningful and tangible steps"" to implement the 2015 Paris climate accord.

The Paris Agreement aims to keep global temperatures from rising another degree Celsius (1.8 Fahrenheit) between now and 2100, a key demand of poor countries ravaged by rising sea levels and other effects of climate change. Last year’s summit in Glasgow produced a compromise deal aimed at keeping that key global warming target alive.

“We aim to restore the ‘grand bargain’ at the center of the Paris Agreement and our collective multilateral climate process,” Shoukry said in a four-page letter to world leaders and delegates taking part in the COP27.

“This year the picture is less encouraging,” he said, warning of backsliding on the delivery of finance pledges to developing countries to increase their efforts to address climate change.

Shoukry said the summit comes amid uphill challenges including the failure of the G-20 meeting of industrial and emerging-market nations earlier this year to produce an agreement on environment. He also pointed to a lack of “concrete agreements” to allow financial support to address the impacts of climate change during the fall meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

The annual conference convenes 197 nations for deliberations on how to address climate change. The COP27 comes as the world faces an energy crisis and a war in Europe that have rattled the global economy.

In recent years, many developing nations and activists have increased long-standing calls to establish a fund to compensate poor countries for devastation brought about by climate change, disproportionately caused by rich countries because of past emissions.

The call was rejected during last year’s summit. Many supporters of the idea, often called “loss and damage,” hope to make progress on it this month. Their arguments could get a boost by the symbolic significance of this conference being held in Egypt, a developing nation in North Africa.

The Egyptian minister said “significant progress” was achieved over the past year, including a $40 billion resilience fund created by the IMF, and the Green Climate Fund which provides some $2.5 billion a year to support developing countries addressing impacts of climate change.

“This progress proves that when there is political will, a sense of urgency and a functional structure, we can collectively make strides in our joint effort to combat climate change,” he said.

He called for countries to launch “implementation frameworks” stemming from the negotiating process of the U.N. climate change convention.

“COP27 creates a unique opportunity for the world to come together, mend multilateralism, rebuild trust and unite at the highest political levels to address climate change,” he said.

The conference, dubbed “Africa COP,"" centers around financial aid to poor countries struggling to cope with the impacts of climate change. It is expected to draw more than 45,000 delegates, including President Joe Biden, and over 100 head of states and governments."

The biggest climate event of the calendar, Cop27, begins next week in Sharm el-Sheikh.

The world gathers in Egypt after a tumultuous 12 months. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has led to global energy shortfalls, triggering cost-of-living crises in rich countries and leaving some poorer nations on the brink of famine.

There has also been a new wave of disasters triggered by the climate crisis – from devastating flooding in Pakistan and western and central Africa, to wildfires and deadly heatwaves across Europe, and Hurricane Ian’s decimation of Florida. A deluge of new scientific reports warn that the world remains far off-track in preventing further dangerous temperature rise.

The Cop27 agenda is packed and progess is much-needed on contentious issues, like climate finance, and countries’ emissions cuts. There will also need to be accountability on the headline-grabbing promises made at the Glasgow summit, Cop26.

The Independent’s climate reporting team will be in Sharm el-Sheikh, offering you an up-close perspective of the two-week summit - and parsing what decisions and stumbling blocks mean for the world’s climate problems far beyond the doors of the negotiating halls.

Ahead of this year’s event, COP27, here’s everything you need to know.

What is COP27?





COP stands for Conference of Parties and involves the meeting of the 197 nations that agreed to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992.

COP27’s goal is to move from negotiations and planning to implementation.

When is COP27?





The conference will begin on Sunday, November 6 and will end on Friday, November 18.

Where is COP27?





COP27 takes place in the green city of Sharm El-Sheikh, in Egypt.

Who will be attending COP27?





COP27 will be attended by a number of politicians across the globe.

Rishi Sunak last week insisted he must focus on the “depressing domestic challenges” rather than go to the COP27 conference in Egypt, drawing widespread criticism.

However, the Prime Minister could U-turn on his decision if he feels sufficient progress has been made in planning for his highly anticipated autumn budget, No 10 has confirmed.

The Scottish Government confirmed that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will be attending the event in Egypt.

US President Joe Biden is also expected to attend.

King Charles III will not be attending the conference as “unanimously agreed” by Downing Street he would not go.

What does COP27 hope to achieve?





The COP27 website says it hopes to “seek to accelerate global climate action through emissions reduction, scaled-up adaptation efforts and enhanced flows of appropriate finance.”

It has broken the aims down into 4 sections: Mitigation, Adaptation, Finance and Collaboration.

Mitigation involves uniting to limit global warming to well below 2c and work hard to keep the 1.5 c target alive.

Adaptation involves adapting so that weather events from heatwaves, floods, forest fires stop becoming an everyday reality of life.

Financial goals are important in COP27 in ensuring climate commitments are followed.

Finally, Collaboration involves “turn[ing] the Glasgow outcome into action, and commence with its implementation.”

4fb91ae7-86e0-482c-a522-4593d175fbcc,"One year has passed since Glasgow hosted the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference – or COP26 for short. The climate jargon of huddles and NDCs (Nationally Determined Contributions) may have long left Scotland, but the global climate negotiations rumble on.

The baton passes to Egypt for COP27 this month. Now is a good time to take stock of what’s happened since COP26, and look forward to what we might expect at COP27.

Since COP26 we have seen continued progress on loss and damage; the ongoing dialogue over high-polluting nations’ financial responsibility to compensate least well-off nations for climate change impacts.

These talks will grind on at COP27, but in the absence of formal binding agreements a few nations are starting to break ranks – with Scotland leading the way. Scotland committed £1 million to address loss and damage ahead of COP26. The Scottish Government then hosted an international loss and damage conference in Edinburgh in October 2022. Denmark followed by becoming the first UN member state to formally pledge loss and damage funding to less-wealthy nations.

Countries are continuing to enhance their pledges for reducing emissions and adapting to climate change. It was agreed in Glasgow that all nations would revisit and strengthen their targets for reducing emissions by the end of 2022. This continual ratcheting-up of climate change targets is a built-in feature of the climate talks, designed to ensure that national commitments become ever-more ambitious over time as technologies develop. By COP27, we should have a much clearer picture of who is planning to do what to reduce emissions.

However, perhaps the biggest developments since COP26 have come away from the negotiating table. 2022 started with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which illustrated how a continued reliance on fossil fuels leaves us and our energy bills at the mercy of authoritarian regimes.

The nature of the energy markets and networks means that despite producing a lot of power from renewable sources, Scotland – and especially our rural communities relying on electricity for heat – faces big bills this winter.

A summer of extreme heat in the Northern Hemisphere saw the suburban fringes of London go up in flames, and Scotland’s railways met speed restrictions due to heat stress on tracks. Heavier than usual monsoon rains, melting glaciers and a legacy of poor urban planning left a third of Pakistan under water and over two million people displaced. Climate protestors have resorted to ever more frequent and dramatic actions as exasperation and distress at a lack of action from governments grows.

COP27 therefore happens against a backdrop of greater societal awareness of the urgency of the climate crisis than there was 12 months ago.

What’s more, the unequal nature of climate impacts is feeding a growing sense that our responses don’t just need to be fast and ambitious, they also need to be fair. Just as it is unfair to expose those in Pakistan to heightened flood risk due to our reluctance to reduce emissions in the UK, so it is unfair to expect those in the Highlands of Scotland to accept large-scale tree planting without consultation as a means of offsetting the emissions of those elsewhere.

Soaring energy bills are leading to an ever-broadening consensus that insulating our homes, renewing our heating networks, and accelerating the shift to renewable energy sources makes good economic sense and has the potential to create fair, decent and stable work for many.

So, my message to world leaders prepping their delegates and negotiators for COP27 would be: Be bold, be ambitious, and be fair.

The 19-year-old Swedish activist has announced that as well as tackling her usual area of climate action and awareness-spreading, she has now thrown her weight behind defeating the West’s “oppressive” capitalist system.

Calling for a “system-wide transformation” at her book launch in London, she claimed that the world’s current “normal” - dictated by the people in power - has caused the climate breakdown.

She said: “We are never going back to normal again because ‘normal’ was already a crisis. What we refer to as normal is an extreme system built on the exploitation of people and the planet.

“It is a system defined by colonialism, imperialism, oppression and genocide by the so-called global North to accumulate wealth that still shapes our current world order.”

Ms Thunberg added: “If economic growth is our only priority, then what we are experiencing now should be exactly what we should be expecting.”

Appearing at London’s Royal Festival Hall to launch her new book, The Climate Book, on Sunday night, she decided to venture into political waters in her speech - having previously avoided doing so."

“As it is now Cops not are not really going to lead to any major changes, unless of course, we use them as an opportunity to mobilise,” she said on stage at the Southbank Centre’s London Literature Festival on Sunday where she was promoting her new work The Climate Book, an anthology of essays on the climate crisis from over one hundred experts."

Aiden Less said to Egypt Today that Extinction Rebellion Youth works to counteract the impact of climate change focusing on non-violent direct action.

‘’Climate change and social justice were bringing in the impact of climate change on marginalized groups so together they form what we describe as climate justice and fighting for climate justice will help push the entire movement forward’’ Less said to Egypt Today.

As a youth environmental activist Less admitted that one of the major changes that he has seen over the past years is centring youth activist.

‘’We have always been part of it, but there is a shift that I have witnessed recently which is youth being the focal point. I believe the role of youth is to really push the conversation forward, climate change and climate justice are always number one priority to governments and corporations so we have to work consistently.’’

Less added that attracting the attention of the international community to climate change crisis is almost impossible task but going back to the point of intersectionality we can use that to interface what is going on in the world with climate justice so taking what is relevant now and trying to interface it with climate justice is a great way to insure that people are talking about it.

‘’My recommendations to COP27 are to put youth voices in the center, making sure that youth committees are intersectional, I hope that COP27 brings climate change and climate justice back to the minds of people, media and the whole international community’’

Less further explained that Legislators, politicians, corporate officials, youth and local leaders will work together to make tangible change with the passion in the mindset that comes from COP27.

As for Egypt hosting COP27 Less said that he thinks that it is really a good transition and a necessary step for COP27 to be held in a place like Egypt.

‘’We have to learn the impact of climate change on other places like Egypt, so having a conversation about climate change in Egypt is really a great thing. My message to the international community is that everybody should get involved, everyone has a role to play especially youth so my message to everyone is get involved, take your friend, classmate or co-worker and start building that community that solve climate change crisis, use all your talents to make the maximum change you can make and try to push the conversation forward to make progress, I think this is one of the main reasons why youth climate justice activism is important.”

Kate Spaulding and Sasha Rotko explained how people view climate change regionally expressing their desire to attend COP 28 and the need for systemic change.

Spaulding said that Extinction Rebellion Youth has the stated aim of using non violent civil disobedience to compel government action to avoid tipping points in the climate system, biodiversity loss and the risk of social and ecological collapse.



‘’Diverse voices need to be heard’ Spaulding and Rotko said.

Spaulding recounted those places where COP is hosted makes a difference in the conversations.

Liberation Day

George Saunders

Bloomsbury Publishing, £18.99 (Ebook £13.29)

After nearly a 10-year break from short story collections, George Saunders returns with Liberation Day, nine tales set in a warped - but perhaps not too distant - future. In his opening story, also titled Liberation Day, the 2017 Booker Prize winner tells of modern slaves whose memories have been wiped, and are captive in the home of 'leaders' who use them as storytelling pawns. Love Letter presents prose from grandfather to grandson, discussing a difficult political climate and the parts we all play in society. A Mom Of Bold Action gives the account of a worried housewife who fears for her son's safety after an attack by a homeless man, raising questions of justice. Complex, gripping and sharp, Saunders' latest collection is a triumph of storytelling, and a frank comment on the roles we hold and our responsibilities in society.

If you're not put off by the length and sinister content, you'll be richly rewarded with a dark and twisted tale. Through separate timelines, it follows Juan - a medium who can commune with the dead, a talent that is exploited by the wealthy and evil Order - and his son Gaspar, who he is struggling to protect from the clutches of those in charge. There's a lot of black magic and the occult, making for grim reading (think satanic rites and bodily mutilations) but Enriquez's writing brings the characters to life - particularly the father and son, both flawed (particularly Juan), but trying their best. It's also a fascinating look at the violent history of Argentina from the Sixties to the 1990s, running side by side with the more fantastical storyline.

A Ballet Of Lepers

Leonard Cohen

Canongate Books, £20 (ebook £13.59)

Long before the string of acclaimed albums, the world tours and the Grammy awards, Leonard Cohen began his career as a young poet and novelist. Though many of those works garnered awards too, his earliest fiction writing has remained hidden - until now, six years after his death, with the release of the titular novella and several short stories. Cohen's lyrical flair and talent with words is apparent throughout - the opening lines of the novella even rhyme - but this does not necessarily make for a pleasant read. Cohen's works here revel in violence, the bulk of which seems to be meted out against women. His characters are ugly souls living out ugly lives. Many of these themes would later be at the heart of his music, but in this format, stripped of a good tune, it is a much more shocking read.

The Climate Book

Greta Thunberg

Allen Lane, £25 (ebook £12.99)

When one of the world's leading environmental activists releases a book called 'The Climate Book', you pretty much know what to expect. That doesn't make it any less of a compelling read - Greta Thunberg has called upon some of the brightest minds in the fight against global warming (and some leading voices you might not expect, like Margaret Atwood) to explain in great detail how the climate works, how mankind is wreaking destruction, and what needs to be done next. At over 450 pages, it's not the easiest of reads - the content is heavy and in parts quite scientific - but it's broken up into bitesize pieces, so is definitely digestible. Thunberg does provide some glimmers of hope, but overall it's a sobering read, and clear a lot needs to be done - particularly by governments and those in charge.

Children's book of the week

The Heartstopper Yearbook

Alice Oseman

Hodder Children's Books, £14.99 (ebook £8.49)

The latest offering in the Heartstopper franchise from writer and illustrator Alice Oseman is certainly one for the superfans of the series - of which there are many, particularly since Netflix brought out an adaptation of the comic earlier this year. This isn't a traditional Heartstopper book, instead it's a deep dive into the universe - Oseman introduces herself and all of the key characters, explaining her inspirations behind different storylines and settings readers know and love. With plenty of mini comics and bonus bits, fans will find much to enjoy - but it's perhaps not one to dive into until you've read the previous four volumes.

It's being held in Egypt, at the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh.

World leaders say it's vital to the global effort to fight climate change.

Some critics see too little progress from years of gatherings.

An Egyptian resort town will begin hosting a massive annual United Nations climate meeting on Sunday. But will it be a place where real action can be taken on addressing climate change, or will it be a distressing example of international greenwashing that makes little serious progress?

It depends on whom you ask. President Joe Biden will be attending what's known as COP27 for at least a day. The White House says he'll ""build on the significant work the United States has undertaken to advance the global climate fight.""

But Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg counts herself among the gathering's critics. Speaking in London at the release of her book, ""The Climate Book,"" the 19-year-old who has gained global fame in the fight against climate change said the meetings are mostly a chance for ""leaders and people in power to get attention, using many different kinds of greenwashing.""

AHEAD OF THE SUMMIT:Flurry of climate change reports have ominous message

WATCH:Climate questions — Who is most vulnerable?

Here's what to know about COP27:

What is COP27?

COP27 is the annual United Nations meeting of the 197 countries that have agreed to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, originally adopted in 1992. The meeting is the decision-making body of the countries that signed onto the framework. It is held to assess how well nations are dealing with climate change.

What are the dates of COP27?

The U.N. Climate Change Conference runs Sunday to Nov. 18.

Where is COP27 being held?

It's being held in the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh, between the desert of the Sinai Peninsula and the Red Sea. It is known for its sandy beaches and coral reefs and is a major tourist destination for divers. It's pronounced Sharm-el-shake.

What does COP27 stand for?

COP is short for ""Conference of the Parties,"" because it is a conference of the parties or countries that signed the agreement. This is the 27th meeting of all the signatories. The first was in 1995 in Berlin. The numbering is slightly off because COP 26 was postponed for a year because of COVID-19. It's pronounced cop (as in police) 27.

Is COP27 necessary?

Before the industrial revolution, the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was 280 parts per million. CO2 traps the sun's heat, warming the plant. This year's measurement is 419 parts per million, a number not seen since the Pliocene Epoch 4.1 to 4.5 million years ago. At that time, the sea level was about 78 feet higher than today, the average temperature was 7 degrees Fahrenheit higher than in pre-industrial times, and studies indicate large forests occupied areas of the Arctic that are now tundra, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Critics have said the entire process of annual meetings and small, incremental and sometimes bureaucratic change is too little, too late. Speaking in London on Sunday, Thunberg said rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented change is needed to deal with global warming.

COP27 has also been criticized for allowing Coca-Cola, one of the world's largest plastic producers, to be a major sponsor of the event. The company has responded that it is prepared to do its part to fight against climate change.

Is this year's COP especially important?

Those attending would tell you every COP is important.

But next year's should get even more attention. It will be the first time the nations that signed the Paris Agreement in 2015 (at COP21) will tell the world how well they've implemented their climate plans and identify what still needs to be done. It is being called the Global Stocktake and will be presented at COP28 in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates.

What's expected to happen in Egypt?

This year countries are supposed to deliver updated plans on how they're going to lower their greenhouse gas emissions, something they agreed to do at last year's COP in Glasgow, Scotland.

Only 23 out of 193 countries have submitted their plans to the U.N.

Because this COP is being held in Africa, it's expected to include more focus on African issues. This is not the first COP to be held in Africa, however. The 2001 and 2016 meetings were in Morocco, 2006 in Kenya and 2011 in South Africa.

What is 'loss and damage' financing, and what does it have to do with COP27?

COP27 is also supposed to take on ""loss and damage"" financing. That's the controversial question of how poor and vulnerable nations dealing with climate change might be compensated by wealthy countries.

Developing countries are demanding some type of global compensation or aid fund, saying their people are living with – and dying from – climate change caused by more developed nations that got wealthy by burning fossil fuels.

Who is attending?

More than 35,000 people from around the world are expected to be in Egypt at the meeting, from official government delegations to climate activists who are will be corralled into a separate designated protest area away from the conference center. Protests are severely restricted in Egypt.

Biden is expected to attend for at least a day. This will be the first COP after the United States' landmark Inflation Reduction Act was passed in August, the largest single climate action the nation has taken.

King Charles III of the United Kingdom, a passionate advocate on behalf of the environment before taking the throne in September, has attended previous COPs. He will not be attending this one."

When you have achieved a certain level of celebrity, you don’t actually have to write a book; you can “create” one. In this instance, the unusual cover line “created by Greta Thunberg” is a replacement for the boring old “edited by”, because the teenage Swedish sensation has collected contributions from more than 100 scientists and activists, contributing a few pages of introduction herself to each section.

The result is a book both important and stunningly handsome, with sober yet stylish typography, colour diagrams and charts, and liberal use of gorgeous or depressing photography. Here is a team of huskies pulling a sled through shallow water. Here is a family of polar bears living in an abandoned wooden hut. (To be fair, the latter look quite happy.)

As a one-stop shop for the latest facts about the science and politics of global warming, this is a superb vademecum, though not a source of comfort. The basic physics of how increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations trap more heat at the planet’s surface, limpidly explained here, has been understood for more than a century. The oil companies themselves knew it very well in the 1970s, and it now commands wide public acceptance, to the extent that only a tiny rump of wilfully ignorant or actively malicious, swivel-headed cranks now deny it.

What more people deny is the scale of mitigation required. Thanks to all those years of lying, we now need to move extremely quickly to cut carbon emissions in order to limit further warming and concomitant rises in sea level and desertification. Meanwhile, nimby-pandering governments are banning onshore wind farms or solar panels in fields. This makes Greta very angry, and it should make us angry too.

The mitigation-deniers are, though, helped by the rhetorical excesses of their opponents. From various contributors in this book – including Thunberg herself – we hear that the planet itself is in danger, which it simply isn’t. Humans could not destroy Earth even if they wanted to; the idea that we are close to doing so is an ecstatic sort of hubris masquerading as self-criticism. “This is not our world,” Thunberg writes. Well, whose is it? Worms’?

We hear, too, that some concentration of CO2 not far from where we are now is a ceiling beyond which the planet won’t be able to support life, which is also known to be false: levels were massively higher during the Cretaceous period, during which the dinosaurs happily romped around eating lush ferns and one another. The point is that they were doing so at a time when temperate forest covered the Arctic, and sea levels were so high that London, Paris, and New York would now all be completely submerged. In the coming decades, up to a billion people might find their homelands have become simply uninhabitable. That is surely bad enough.

This book’s anti-capitalist, anti-technology strain of thinking, too, is unhelpful. The “methods and mindset” of industrialisation can’t fix the problems they have created, complains Thunberg at one point, except that this is exactly what happened with the hole in the ozone layer first identified in the 1970s. (Scientists quickly figured out that chlorofluorocarbons were the culprit; fridges and aerosols were re-engineered; and the hole began to heal.) One suspects that almost the worst thing that could happen for anti-capitalist environmentalists is a similar technical fix, perhaps supplied by nuclear fusion.

But that lies in the future. Among the brilliant expositions of oceanic physics and morose paeans to indigenous wisdom, the best contributors here do focus on the positives of what can and must be done right now.

The great American environmentalist Bill McKibben, for one, hymns the enormous advances we have made in capturing solar energy. “We shouldn’t be digging down to find coal and gas and oil and setting them on fire – that’s dirty, dangerous and depressing,” he observes. “Instead, we need to rely on the burning ball of gas 93 million miles up in the sky. Energy from heaven, not from hell!” Someone please tell Rishi.

LONDON (Reuters) - Climate activist Greta Thunberg on Sunday called out next month's United Nations climate summit in Egypt for being ""held in a tourist paradise in a country that violates many basic human rights.""

Speaking at the London Literature Festival at the Southbank Centre where she was promoting her new book, ""The Climate Book"", 19-year-old Thunberg dismissed the looming climate summit, known as COP27, as an opportunity for ""people in power... to [use] greenwashing, lying and cheating.""

While Thunberg did attend protests in Glasgow last year for COP26, she said she won't attend COP27, scheduled to be held from Nov. 6 to Nov. 18 in Sharm El Sheikh.

""The space for civil society is going to be extremely limited,"" she said. ""It's important to leave space for those who need to be there. It will be difficult for activists to make their voices heard.""

Public demonstration is effectively banned in Egypt and limits on accreditation and attendance badges for activists have been a point of contention at previous U.N. climate summits.

Thunberg rose to prominence in 2018 at the age of 15 by staging school strikes in her native Sweden, becoming the face of the youth activist climate movement.

During Sunday's event, she decried the ""sustainability crisis"" as a ""crisis of information not getting through.""

Her book includes explanatory articles from over 100 climate experts, including renowned climate scientists Katharine Hayhoe and Michael Mann, as well as authors including Margaret Atwood.

""I wanted it to be educational, which is a bit ironic since my thing is school strikes,"" she said.

Asked to comment on recent protest actions by Just Stop Oil activists which saw them throw soup at Vincent van Gogh's 'Sunflowers' at London's National Gallery, Thunberg said, ""People are trying to find new methods because we realize that what we have been doing up until now has not done the trick. It's only reasonable to expect these kinds of different actions.""

Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg said on Sunday she will skip next month's COP27 talks in Egypt, slamming the global summit as a forum for ""greenwashing"".

""I'm not going to COP27 for many reasons, but the space for civil society this year is extremely limited,"" she said during a question and answer at the launch of her latest book at London's Southbank Centre.

The 19-year-old activist had previously expressed solidarity on Twitter with ""prisoners of conscience"" being held in Egypt ahead of the UN's 27th conference on climate, opening in the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh on November 6.

""The COPs are mainly used as an opportunity for leaders and people in power to get attention, using many different kinds of greenwashing,"" she said.

The COP conferences, she added, ""are not really meant to change the whole system"", but instead encourage gradual progress.

""So as it is, the COPs are not really working, unless of course we use them as an opportunity to mobilise.""

Released on Thursday, Thunberg's ""The Climate Book"" includes about 100 contributions from various experts, including economist Thomas Piketty, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and the writer Naomi Klein.

Thunberg's royalties for the book will go to her eponymous foundation, which will distribute them to charitable organisations working on environmental issues.

The activist said she wanted the book to ""be educational, which is a bit ironic since my thing is school strikes"", referring to her protests in front of the Swedish parliament starting in 2018.

Again and again on Sunday, Thunberg called for more people to get involved in climate activism, saying the time had come for ""drastic changes"" to the status quo.

""In order to change things, we need everyone -- we need billions of activists,"" she said.

From a climate change campaigner to presenting a new far-Left political agenda against “racist” capitalism - meet the new Greta Thunberg.

The 19-year-old Swedish activist has announced that as well as tackling her usual area of climate action and awareness-spreading, she has now thrown her weight behind defeating the West’s “oppressive” capitalist system.

Calling for a “system-wide transformation” at her book launch in London, she claimed that the world’s current “normal” - dictated by the people in power - has caused the climate breakdown.

She said: “We are never going back to normal again because ‘normal’ was already a crisis. What we refer to as normal is an extreme system built on the exploitation of people and the planet.

“It is a system defined by colonialism, imperialism, oppression and genocide by the so-called global North to accumulate wealth that still shapes our current world order.”

Ms Thunberg added: “If economic growth is our only priority, then what we are experiencing now should be exactly what we should be expecting.”

Appearing at London’s Royal Festival Hall to launch her new book, The Climate Book, on Sunday night, she decided to venture into political waters in her speech - having previously avoided doing so.

”We are still here, and we are not planning on going anywhere. Young people all over the world are stepping up, showing that our leaders messed with the wrong generation.” My full speech from The Climate Event at Southbank Centre this Sunday is here: https://t.co/d9WfUbCwSQ pic.twitter.com/OwZcCxDHXI — Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) November 2, 2022

Released last week, the book includes around 100 contributions from various climate experts, including writer Naomi Klein, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, chief of the World Health Organization, and Thomas Piketty, the economist.

Expressing views that seemed more radical than in the past, she added that the climate crisis “has its roots in racist, oppressive extractivism that is exploiting both people and the planet to maximise short-term profits for a few”.

People were quick to point out the political emphasis on social media, with one best-selling author saying “this is proof that Greta hates capitalism for reasons that have nothing whatsoever to do with climate change”.

Michael Shellenberger, an American author, posted on Twitter that the “whole capitalist system” Ms Thunberg referred to has led to larger food surpluses than at any point in history, average human life expectancy to rise from 30 to 70 and a drop in total deaths from natural disasters.

In fact, the ""whole capitalist system"" has allowed for average life expectancy of humans to rise from 30 to 70. pic.twitter.com/RqzmfttuK9 — Michael Shellenberger (@ShellenbergerMD) November 1, 2022

Ms Thunberg told Samira Ahmed, the BBC journalist, during a question and answer part of the evening that “fascist movements offering easy, false solutions and scapegoats to complex problems are growing and becoming more normalised”.

When asked by Ms Ahmed whether she thought it was as simple as making laws that outlaw things, she responded: “There are many [things we can do], but while we do these things that we can do within our current system, we have to realise that we need a system-wide transformation.

“We need to change everything because right now our current system is on a collision course with the future of humanity and the future of our civilization”.

Ms Thunberg also described the upcoming Cop27 as a forum for “greenwashing” and said she would not be attending.

The teenager, who is widely hailed as the world’s spokesman for climate change, shot to worldwide fame after attending her first United Nations climate conference in 2018, when the then 15-year-old said: “I expected it to be more action and less talking.”

During the question and answer session on Sunday, she said: “I’m not going to Cop27 for many reasons, but the space for civil society this year is extremely limited.”

This year’s conference, taking place from Nov 6 to 18 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, will see world leaders - including Rishi Sunak - gather to discuss the pressing climate crisis.

“Of course, it’s very symbolic that it’s held in a tourist centre - a tourist paradise - in a country that violates most of the basic human rights - and many world leaders are too busy to go there,” she added.

Addressing the coverage of her political take in the new book on Wednesday morning, she posted on Twitter:

2308fede-bdb9-4ba9-9e4f-c0db6c315b2f,"













Nov 3 (Reuters) - Methane emissions have emerged as a top threat to the global climate, with scientists and policymakers calling for aggressive action to curb the output.

At last year's U.N. climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, more than 100 countries pledged a 30% cut from 2020 methane emissions levels by 2030. But few have since carved out clear plans to reach that goal.

Instead, scientists using satellite monitoring are discovering new emissions sources, including leaks from oil wells and natural gas pipelines.

About 60% of the methane in the atmosphere comes from industrial sources, including oil and gas pipelines and drill sites, as well as feed lots, croplands and landfills.

Research increasingly shows that reducing emissions of methane is vital to keeping planetary warming to within 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times to avert the worst impacts of climate change.

MATTER OF URGENCY

After being largely ignored for decades, scientists now know that methane is much more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas in the short term, even though it lingers for only a decade in the atmosphere before breaking down while CO2 lingers for centuries.

Scientists normally compare the warming effects of methane and carbon dioxide over one century, and over that timescale methane is 28 times worse. Over 20 years, however, methane is 80 times worse, according to recent research.

That's important because the world is on track to exceed the 2015 Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to less than 2 degrees in mere decades.

""If I thought we had 100 years to deal with climate change, I'd be an awful lot more relaxed about it,"" Mike Berners-Lee, expert and author on carbon footprints, said. ""If you're interested in the climate impacts, we'll be experiencing in 2050 ... you'd be absolutely screaming about methane emissions.""

Methane's frontloaded climate impact is doubly worrying because the world is closer than previously thought to crossing ""tipping points"" at which climate feedback loops kick in to make global warming self-perpetuating.

A study in September suggested that some of the events that could touch off those feedback loops, like the collapse of the Greenland Ice Sheet or the melting of Arctic permafrost, are imminent.

WHERE IT COMES FROM

Three-fifths of the world's estimated methane emissions are from human activity; the rest are from natural sources like swamps.

Of the human-caused emissions, two-thirds are from livestock farming and fossil fuels, with much of the rest from decomposing waste as well as rice cultivation, Climate and Clean Air Coalition data show.

But emitters have not kept good records, and scientists trying to improve them in the past decade have had a shock.

""Everywhere we looked, methane emissions turned out to be higher than agencies said they should be,"" said Robert Jackson, who co-authored a February study on methane's warming impacts. ""That was true of oil and gas fields, landfills and feedlots.""

While scientists can accurately measure the level of methane in the atmosphere, understanding where it is coming from is crucial for policymakers seeking to impose regulations that reduce the emissions.

WORSE THAN COAL?

Petroleum-producing companies and nations are lobbying hard for natural gas as a ""bridge fuel"" to renewables as the world undertakes a clean energy transition to fight climate change. Their argument: burning natural gas emits half as much carbon per kilowatt as coal.

But factor in gas industry leaks from drill pads, pipelines, compressors, and other infrastructure, and those gains can quickly be erased.

""There's a break-even point in how much methane is leaked for ... natural gas (to be) actually worse than coal for the climate,"" said Sam Abernethy, co-author of the February study.

World governments, including the United States, are introducing requirements that the oil and gas industry detect and repair leaks after studies showed leaks in the industry were a huge problem.

The European Union recently endorsed labeling some natural gas projects as ""green"" in a major boost to the industry.

The jump in giving was significant—25% over 2020—and it outpaced the growth of giving overall. Yet contributions to climate philanthropy accounted for just 1 to 1.5% of all giving, according to the report—just $7.5 billion to $12.5 billion out of the $810 billion given to all causes in 2021.

Donors should be recognized for increasing their support, says Helen Mountford, CEO of ClimateWorks. But the global costs for transitioning to a carbon-neutral economy will be in the trillions of dollars. Philanthropy’s few billion dollars are a start but still fall short. “This is nowhere near fast enough,” she says. “We need to do a lot more.”

Giving by foundations increased even more, jumping 40% from 2020 to 2021, reaching $3.1 billion. Much of that was due to new big donors like the Bezos Earth Fund, which gave $519.2 million in 2021.

Mountford says that a number of new foundations are donating to climate-related causes, perhaps inspired in part by Bezos but also by the increasingly dire effects of drought, extreme weather, and sea-level rise around the world.

Young wealthy donors have also been drawn to the issue and account for some of the increased support, says Jennifer Kitt, president of the Climate Leadership Initiative, which advises donors on climate-giving strategies. She says younger members of wealthy families are pushing for increased climate funding because it’s an issue that directly affects them.

“Younger members of families learned this science in school and are now in their late 20s and early 30s,” she says. “They can see with clarity the timeline is running out and the impact it will have on them,” she says.

While foundation giving to curb climate change is on the rise, it is also increasing from a very small base. Foundations, particularly those that do not focus directly on the environment, have been slow to give to climate-related causes, says Phil Buchanan, president of the Center for Effective Philanthropy. A survey released by the center this summer found that 90% of foundation executives said climate change was an urgent problem, but only 10% said it was the most important issue to address right now.

The foundation executives surveyed said that government and businesses should be doing more. They feel overwhelmed by an issue that seems complex and global in scale and are uncertain of which strategies are effective, says Buchanan. And reports citing the dearth of funding for every issue are common. But, he says, climate, which affects just about every area philanthropy addresses, is different. “There’s this sense that this is not really what we do because we’ve got these other issues that we focus on,” he says. “This is the existential crisis of our time. I worry that if folks sit on the sidelines, they’ll be ready to act when it’s too late.”

The number of nonprofits receiving funding has grown, too, according to the report. In 2015, about 1,400 groups worldwide received funding for climate-related work. In 2022, that number nearly doubled to 2,775.

The increase in the number of groups working on the issue is encouraging, says Mountford. “We actually need to help build this field,” she says. “We can’t just rely on a few organizations. We really need to go deeper and wider, to have multiple different institutions helping in the climate fight.”

She also says that the increased number of groups may also indicate that more funding is going to climate-justice groups. But that is not clear from this report. Climate-justice groups — those that are often led by people of color, prioritize race, gender, and class in their approach to climate solutions and focus on approaches to climate change with equitable outcomes — have long been underfunded and receive only a tiny fraction of climate funding. Yet the report does not indicate how much funding they receive or whether that total is rising or falling.

Mountford says that’s because donors rarely categorize their giving in a way that breaks out justice-oriented groups in the United States and overseas. She says ClimateWorks is prioritizing better understanding of these groups and this giving so it can include more data in future studies.

Increased giving to climate change over all does not mean that justice-oriented groups are receiving more funding. The overwhelming majority of funding still goes to big green groups, academics, and think tanks, says Bineshi Albert, co-executive director of the Climate Justice Alliance, a coalition of 84 groups. “We need philanthropy to get on board with the visionary, community-led climate solutions and shift more money to the grassroots now,” he says.

The report does mention important philanthropic efforts to help get more funding to these groups, including the Donors of Color Network’s Climate Justice Pledge, the World Forum on Climate Justice, held during last year’s United Nations climate meetings, and Candid’s recent guide for donors, “Centering Equity and Justice in Climate Philanthropy.”

Last year, donors also gave more money to climate efforts outside of the United States and Europe. Funding for Latin American groups doubled, and funding to those in Africa increased by 50%. But funding outside of the United States and Europe still only accounted for a third of the dollars spent.

There has also been an increased focus by donors protecting forests — funding for that issue grew by nearly 70% over the previous year, to $260 million. That was due in part to various efforts including a multi-year $5 billion announcement by nine grant makers, including the Bezos Earth Fund and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, to help bolster biodiversity. Much of the pledged funding targeted programs to help indigenous and local communities preserve forests.

Donors also gave to clean electricity, food, and agriculture and to carbon-dioxide removal technologies that some environmentalists oppose.

While giving remains small, the growth is encouraging, says Kitt. “The most exciting thing is the growth and the scale. Every one of us needs to dream bigger.”"

""The new British Prime Minister has upset the leftie lovies and climate alarmists in Europe, right across the UK too,” Mr Smith said.

“Head of politics at Green Alliance Chris Venables described Sunak's decision to miss COP27, as a 'massive strategic error' within the context of current global instability.

“Rebecca Newsom, head of politics at Greenpeace UK, said Sunak's decision was akin to a runner failing to turn up with the baton at a crucial stage of the relay"".

Mr Smith also said the British Labour Party has “savaged him, as you'd expect”."

Rishi Sunak insisted he must focus on the “depressing domestic challenges” rather than attend the COP27 climate summit in Egypt after he was accused of a “failure of leadership”.

The Prime Minister insisted he is “personally committed” to tackling the climate crisis after he pulled out of the United Nations conference next month that Liz Truss was due to attend.

Conservative former culture secretary Nadine Dorries said Mr Sunak is “wrong” not to attend the Sharm El-Sheikh summit, saying global heating is the “biggest crisis facing our planet”.

She joined activists and opposition parties in criticising the move, with shadow climate change secretary Ed Miliband accusing Mr Sunak of a “massive failure of leadership”.

But Mr Sunak insisted it is “right” for him to instead focus on the UK economy in talks with Chancellor Jeremy Hunt ahead of their autumn budget on November 17.

Speaking to reporters during a visit to Croydon University Hospital, the Prime Minister said: “The leadership that we have shown on the climate is unmatched almost along the world.

“It’s important to me that, as Prime Minister, we leave behind an environment that is better for our children and grandchildren. I’m very passionate about that. I’m very personally committed to it.

“I just think, at the moment, it’s right that I’m also focusing on the depressing domestic challenges we have with the economy.

“I think that’s what people watching would reasonably expect me to be doing as well.”

The PM’s decision not to attend the summit was earlier defended by Environment Secretary Thérèse Coffey.

Ms Coffey insisted the “big political moments” tend to happen at the conference every five years and Mr Sunak had more urgent matters at home.

The international meeting is due to take place in Egypt between November 6 and 18.

It comes after Mr Sunak demoted two ministers with responsibility for tackling climate change. COP president Alok Sharma and climate minister Graham Stuart kept the jobs they had held under previous prime minister Liz Truss but were removed from the Cabinet.

Ms Coffey said she and “several senior government ministers” will be attending but could not confirm if the King, a passionate environmentalist, would also attend now that there has been a change of leadership.

Ms Truss had reportedly told the King he should stay away from COP27.

“I think it’s up to him,” Ms Coffey said. “I know that he takes an interest in this particular issue, but it’s up to him.”

Downing Street said later on Friday it was “unanimously agreed” by Buckingham Palace and the Government that the King would not attend COP27 under the previous administration.

A spokeswoman added she is “not aware” that the advice has changed.

The annual UN climate meetings are designed to help governments agree steps to limit world temperature rises.

The UK hosted last year’s COP26 in Glasgow, with then-PM Boris Johnson stressing the need to act by warning it was a “one minute to midnight moment”. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer criticised Mr Sunak’s move to skip the summit.

“Britain showing up to work with world leaders is an opportunity to grasp. Not an event to shun,” he said.

Shadow climate change secretary Ed Miliband said it showed a “massive failure of leadership”.

Green MP Caroline Lucas added: “The first test of leadership is to turn up. The new PM’s decision not to attend COP27 makes a mockery of any government claims on continued climate leadership — and what a shameful way to end the UK’s COP presidency.”

Rebecca Newsom, the head of politics at Greenpeace UK, said the move suggests Mr Sunak does not take climate change “seriously enough”.

“The UK Government is supposed to hand over the COP presidency to their Egyptian counterparts at next month’s summit,” she said. “For Rishi Sunak not to show up is like a runner failing to turn up with the baton at a crucial stage of the relay.” As well as the upcoming Budget, Mr Sunak is faced with having to unite a fractured Tory party and fixing a floundering economy.

d9752ca6-79b2-4b04-bedb-98fcde2548cc,"The most contentious issue in climate negotiations is money. It is accepted that rich countries need to help the developing world financially to reduce emissions and deal with climate change. How and how much has been a big topic in climate negotiations for decades. But developing economies do not see money flowing their way at anywhere near the scale needed.

The finance pledges from the 2015 Paris Agreement have still not been properly met. At COP26 last year, developed countries promised to double their climate adaptation finance to developing economies by 2025, in response to the fact that the gaps are largest for this type of climate finance, which developing economies need most. But developed economies have big public debts from the COVID-19 pandemic, and huge pressure at home to help people and businesses cope with energy bills. The German government alone is preparing to spend around €200 billion (A$310 billion) to buffer gas and electricity price rises. And interest rates are rising.

So funding pledges now look much harder to fulfil. This could become a particularly sore point as this year’s COP is hosted in Africa, a continent highly vulnerable to climate change and with generally poor financial resources. It’s likely there will be a strong focus on climate change adaptation and international equity.

In a basket yet harder is the so-called “loss and damage” debate. Developing countries argue that they should receive financial compensation for inevitable climate damages, given that it is mostly the rich that have caused climate change. The moral case is sound, but the politics in most rich countries is firmly stacked against sending money to poorer countries as compensation, as distinct from support for actions to reduce emissions or help deal with climate impacts. Loss and damage could become a bigger and bigger roadblock in climate negotiations.

Stepping back from controversies over money, the overarching topic for international climate policy is ambition. The Paris Agreement framework is geared to continually ratchet up the ambition in countries’ commitments to cut emissions. Last year’s COP decided that countries that had not yet updated their 2030 emissions targets should do so by now. But only a few have done so, and the overall strength of pledges remains insufficient .

The next important marker will be countries’ emissions targets for 2035, and COP27 is a waypoint to these. How climate ambition will fare over coming years as governments focus on national security and energy affordability is uncertain. Where geopolitical and energy pressure shifts policy and politics and especially where it has installed populist or right-wing governments, climate policy will tend to take a back seat. But it may also come back strongly on the agenda. This could come as a corollary of clean energy and industry policy, because of rising concerns about climate impacts, or as a way to strengthen international alliances between like-minded nations.

The short-term effect of Russia’s aggression is that European countries are compensating for lacking Russian gas by slowing the shift away from coal and nuclear power, by building infrastructure to import gas from elsewhere, accelerating renewable energy deployment and saving energy.

High energy prices in world markets encourage continued investment in new coal, oil and gas production, which runs counter to the climate objective. But they also promote investment in clean energy supply, investments to use energy more efficiently, and shifting from fossil fuels to electricity for example through heat pumps and electric cars. The sky-high prices of 2022 will not last.

Europe’s big Russia lesson is that dependence on energy imports can be dangerous. Diversification of import sources helps, but there is a fundamental sense that a safe energy supply needs domestic energy production. For any country not rich in fossil fuels this means renewable energy, or in some cases nuclear — climate-friendly options that also avoid the risk of future energy price shocks. In the words of Germany’s finance minister, “ renewable energy is freedom energy ”.

The new US Inflation Reduction Act gives huge subsidies for American clean energy industries. Europe supports its own emerging zero-carbon industries, as does China and other East Asian countries . The International Energy Agency , in its flagship annual report released last week, finds that global clean energy investment is poised to rise quickly.

For countries strong in clean energy technology, there can be a positive feedback effect on climate policy. If domestic industries benefit from the shift to zero carbon energy, then that is an extra reason for setting stronger emissions targets, and encouraging other countries to do the same.

And those greater investments in advanced green technologies tend to bring prices down, also making large-scale deployment more affordable in developing countries. This has been seen in the dramatic reductions in the cost of solar panels over the years, and it can be the case with other technologies from energy storage to electric cars.

The quest for industrial leadership in the shift to zero-emissions energy, industrial and transport systems holds real promise to drive global greenhouse gas emissions down.

In this light, the COP27 climate negotiations offer a chance for countries to affirm their commitment to cut emissions and strengthen their targets. That will hardly make up for the troubled state of affairs on climate finance. But it could be helpful in keeping the global climate talks on a positive track in difficult times.

Finally, the geopolitical shifts of this year may cause some countries to reposition on international climate action. New alliances could emerge, and ideas like the G7 “climate club” could blossom.

The crisis of 2022 sets global climate action back in the first instance, but the shakeup also holds opportunity.

96cc70bd-ab87-4a51-aa34-cba73d79cc84,"Barbados Prime Minister Mia Amor Mottley spoke passionately to the United Nations General Assembly in September about the mounting debt many developing countries are shouldering and its increasing impact on their ability to thrive.

The average debt for low- and middle-income countries, excluding China, reached 42% of their gross national income in 2020, up from 26% in 2011. For countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, the annual payments just to service that debt averaged 30% of their total exports.

At the same time, these countries are facing a “triple crisis of climate change, of pandemic and indeed now the conflict that is leading to the inflationary pressures that lead regrettably to people taking circumstances into their own hands,” Mottley said.

Rising borrowing costs coupled with high inflation and slow economic growth have left developing countries like hers in a difficult position when it comes to climate change. High debt payments mean countries have fewer resources for mitigating and adapting to climate change. Yet climate change is increasing their vulnerability, and that can raise their sovereign risk, increasing the cost of borrowing. Declining productive capacity and tax base can lead to higher debt risks. It’s a vicious cycle.

As one solution, countries and international organizations are talking about “debt-for-climate swaps” to help tackle both problems at the same time. U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed mentioned debt-for-climate swaps ahead of the November 2022 U.N. Climate Change Conference as one option for refinancing countries’ “crippling” debt.

How debt swaps work

Debt-for-climate swaps allow countries to reduce their debt obligations in exchange for a commitment to finance domestic climate projects with the freed-up financial resources.

They have been used since the late 1980s to preserve the environment and address the liquidity crisis in developing countries, including Bolivia, Costa Rica and Belize. These are commonly known as “debt-for-nature swaps.”

Belize, for example, was able to lower its debt in exchange for committing to designate 30% of its marine areas as protected areas and to spend $US4 million a year for the next two decades on marine conservation under a complex debt-for-nature swap.

The swap, organized in 2021 by The Nature Conservancy, involves the U.S.-based environmental group lending funds at a low-interest rate to Belize to buy back $553 million in commercial debt at a deep discount of 45%. The Nature Conservancy raised funds from the investment bank Credit Swisse via the issuance of “blue bonds” backed by the U.S. government, which gave the bonds a strong investment-grade credit rating.

Similarly, Costa Rica has carried out two debt-for-nature swaps with the United States. Under the swaps, Costa Rica agreed to allocate $53 million for conservation projects. It has already planted more than 60,000 trees and reversed its deforestation.

While debt-for-nature swaps have been used mostly for conservation, the same concept could be expanded to climate change mitigation and adaptation activities, such as building solar farms or sea walls. Some finance experts have suggested that debt-for-climate swaps could be structured in a way that could also encourage private-sector bond holders to exchange the national debt they hold for carbon offsets.

Three keys to successful debt-for-climate swaps

I work with the Climate Policy Lab at the Fletcher School at Tufts University. Our experience with debt swaps offers lessons for the design and implementation of debt-for-climate swaps.

First, the complex governance structures of debt swaps have limited their use. In the past, transactions were generally small, generating only about $1 billion in funding for the environment from 1987 to 2003. A term sheet template for future debt-for-climate swaps could reduce the complexity and lower the time and costs involved.

Second, debt-for-climate swaps would need to relieve enough of the debt burden to allow debtor countries to invest in climate adaptation and mitigation projects. For instance, the U.S. created debt-for-nature swaps with Indonesia in 2009 that were criticized for not doing enough to help the Indonesian government achieve its conservation goals.

Another concern is known as “additionality” – ensuring that the swaps lead to additional climate efforts, as opposed to covering efforts already planned or already paid for with international climate finance.

With widening gaps between the amount of adaptation assistance reaching countries and the amount they need, debt-for-climate swaps can be a meaningful source of funding. Climate Policy Initiative, a nonprofit research group, recently estimated that about 90% of the adaptation needs countries listed in their Nationally Determined Contributions – the climate change plans they submit to the U.N. – can be only met with help from development banks or other countries.

Regions experimenting with debt swaps

A few regions are testing debt-for-climate swaps.

The Economic and Social Commission for Western Africa has developed a Climate/Sustainable Development Goal Debt Swap, in which it functions as a liaison between creditors and seven pilot countries. The initiative focuses on advancing sustainable development and climate goals, such as developing more resilient agriculture.

Similarly, as part of the Caribbean Resilience Fund, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean plans to launch a Debt for Climate Adaptation Swap. It aims to reduce the $527 million of debt in three pilot countries by issuing green bonds, similar to Belize’s debt swap. Development banks would play a crucial role by guaranteeing new bonds and reducing the credit risk.

With carefully designed debt-for-climate swaps and support from international institutions, developing countries could expand their finance for desperately needed climate mitigation and adaptation actions and remove some of their heavy debt burden."

The Inverclyde Climate Beacon - comprising the Beacon Arts Centre, RIG Arts, Inverclyde Libraries, Inverclyde Shed, Belville Community Garden and others - was set up last year following the COP26 conference in Glasgow.

To encourage people to think about the impact of climate change, the Climate Beacon has been running events including musical performances, upcycling workshops, plays and exhibitions.

A report released to mark a year of the project reveals that these activities have 'attracted diverse audiences' and 'successfully engaged new people in the climate conversation'.

The activities are also said to have 'brought abstract climate concepts to life' and created a 'strong appetite for further work'.

Future projects for the Inverclyde Climate Beacon include gathering ideas from local people about a hydroelectric energy scheme.

Set up by arts and sustainability charity Creative Carbon Scotland, the Climate Beacon project is funded by the Scottish Government, Creative Scotland and Museums Galleries Scotland.

Lisa McRuvie of the Beacon Arts Centre said: ""Strengthening partnerships, forging new relationships and building engagement as a collective within our communities will help us build a much deeper understanding of the effects of climate change."""
8bfdc980-94ac-43be-be8e-196d96e72189,"Heatwaves brought on by human-caused climate breakdown have cost the global economy about $16tn since the 1990s, according to a study.

The research calculates the financial impact of extreme heat on infrastructure, agriculture, productivity, human health and other areas.

“We have been underestimating the true economic costs we’ve suffered because of global warming so far, and we are likely underestimating the costs going out into the future,” said Justin Mankin, an assistant professor of geography at Dartmouth College and senior author of the study published in the journal Science Advances.

Despite having the lowest carbon emissions, it is the tropics and the global south that bear almost the entirety of the economic brunt of extreme heat. This is because they are warmer and therefore hit harder by heatwaves, and also because they are more economically vulnerable and therefore more susceptible to economic depression and the costs of adapting to the climate crisis.

Using data covering about 66% of the world’s population, the researchers examined temperature measurements from the hottest five-day periods of the years between 1992 and 2013 and compared them with national economic data from that same period, segmented for regions.

Extreme heat had a wide range of effects on people and economies, said Christopher Callahan, a researcher at Dartmouth College and lead author of the study. “We know that heatwaves kill crops and cause illnesses like heat stroke, but they also have other effects such as increased interpersonal aggression, increased rates of workplace injury, and reduced mental performance.”

Until recently, most studies on the subject were based on averages, but these can mask the effects of local and temporary events, according to Dr Leonie Wenz, the deputy head of the research department on complexity science at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, who was not involved in the study.

“They do not fully reflect how we as humans experience temperature. What really matters for us, what affects our wellbeing, our productivity, and our decisions are the extremes and the fluctuations from one day, or week, to the next.”

The study found that the world’s wealthiest regions, such as areas of Europe and North America, experienced an average 1.5% loss of GDP per capita per year due to extreme heat. By comparison, low-income regions – such as India and Indonesia – recorded a 6.7% GDP per capita loss yearly.

The bill had been footed mainly by countries that had not benefited from industrialisation, said Mankin, creating a vicious cycle.

“Low-income countries have been asked to develop and industrialise in a global economy that strategically disadvantages them,” he said. “And they’re doing so while also being hammered by the impacts of global warming that has been generated by the global north. It’s kind of a double whammy.”"

If the world is indeed entering a new Cold War, it bears little resemblance to the final years of that global conflict with its frequent summits between smiling leaders and its arms agreements aimed at de-escalating nuclear tensions. Instead, the world today seems more like the perilous first decade of that old Cold War, marked by bloody regional conflicts, threats of nuclear strikes, and the constant risk of superpower confrontation.

While world leaders debate the Ukraine crisis at the United Nations and news flashes from that battle zone become a part of our daily lives, the most dramatic and dangerous changes may be occurring at the other end of Eurasia, from the Indian Ocean to the Western Pacific. There, Beijing and Washington are forming rival coalitions as they maneuver over a possible war focused on the island of Taiwan and for dominance over a vast region that’s home to more than half of humanity.

And yet, despite the obvious dangers of another war, the crises there are little more than a distraction from a far more serious challenge facing humanity. With so many mesmerized by the conflict in Ukraine and the possibility of another over Taiwan, world leaders largely ignore the rising threat of climate change. It seems to matter little that, in recent months, we’ve been given unnerving previews of what’s to come. “Geopolitical divides are undermining…all forms of international cooperation,” UN Secretary General António Guterres told world leaders at the General Assembly last month. “We cannot go on like this. Trust is crumbling, inequalities are exploding, our planet is burning.”

To take in the full import of such an undiplomatic warning from the planet’s senior diplomat, think of geopolitical conflict and climate change as two storm fronts—one a fast-moving thunderstorm, the other a slower tropical depression—whose convergence might well produce a cataclysm of unprecedented destructive power.

The Geopolitics of the Old Cold War

Although the rival power blocs in this new Cold War across Eurasia resemble those of the 1950s, there are subtle differences that make the current balance of power less stable and potentially more prone to armed conflict.

Right after China’s communists captured Beijing in October 1949, their leader Mao Zedong forged a close alliance with the boss of the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin, that shook the world. With those two communist states dominating much of the vast Eurasian land mass, the Cold War was suddenly transformed from a regional into a global conflict.

In 1950, when that new communist alliance launched a meat-grinder war against the West on the Korean peninsula, Washington scrambled for a strategy to contain the spread of communist influence beyond an “Iron Curtain” stretching 5,000 miles across Eurasia. In January 1951, the National Security Council (NSC) compiled a top secret report warning that “the United States is now in a war of survival,” which it was in danger of losing. Were actual combat to erupt in Europe, the 10 active US army divisions there could be crushed by the Soviet Union’s 175 divisions. So, the NSC recommended that Washington increase its reliance on “strategic air power” to deliver its expanding “atomic stockpile.” In addition, it suggested Washington should match its North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) commitment by building a “position of strength in the Far East, thus obtaining an active strategic base against Russia in the event of general war with the Soviets.” Current Issue View our current issue

With surprising speed, American diplomats implemented that strategy, signing treaties and mutual-defense pacts meant to encircle Eurasia with rings of steel, especially in the form of new air bases. After transforming the just-formed NATO into an expressly military alliance, Washington quickly negotiated five bilateral defense pacts along the edge of Asia with Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, and Australia. To bolster that continent’s long southern flank, the Western alliance then forged two mutual-defense pacts: METO (the Middle East Treaty Organization) and SEATO (the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization). To complete its 360° encirclement of Eurasia, the United States formed NORAD (the North American Aerospace Command) with Canada, deploying a massive armada of missiles, bombers, and early-warning radar to check any future Soviet attacks across the Arctic.

Within a decade, the United States had constructed an aerial empire, subsuming the sovereignty of the dozens of allied nations and allowing US Air Force jet fighters to fly their skies as if they were their own. This imperium of the clouds would be tethered to the earth by hundreds of US air bases, home to 580 behemoth B-52 bombers, 4,500 jet fighters, and an armada of missiles that, by 1960, allowed the Air Force to claim nearly half the Pentagon’s swelling budget.

Although this defense architecture rested on the threat of thermonuclear war, it introduced a surprising element of geopolitical stability to the superpower confrontation of that era. As a start, it stretched Soviet defenses thin along a 12,000-mile frontier and so, strangely enough, reduced the threat that a single, concentrated point of confrontation could escalate into an atomic war. Indeed, during the 45 years of the Cold War, there would be just four moments when nuclear war threatened, all quickly defused: the Taiwan Straits crisis of 1958, the Berlin crisis of 1961, the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, and the Able Archer NATO exercise of 1983. With the Soviets effectively confined, Washington could inflict a maximum cost at a minimum price whenever its rival tried to break out of its geopolitical isolation, first with moderate success in Cuba and Angola and then with devastating effect in Afghanistan, precipitating the collapse of the Soviet Union.

The US and China Face Off

Some 30 years after that Cold War ended, however, strategic gaps have appeared in Washington’s encirclement of Eurasia, particularly along the continent’s southern flank. Among other things, its strong Cold War era position in the Middle East has weakened considerably. Once subordinated allies have become increasingly independent of Washington’s writ—notably, Turkey (forming an “axis of good” with Russia and Iran), Egypt (purchasing $2 billion in Russian jet fighters), and even Saudi Arabia (doing major oil deals with Moscow). Meanwhile, despite a trillion-dollar, decade-plus US intervention there, Iraq is collapsing into failed-state status, while moving ever closer to Iran.

The most significant gap was, however, opened by Washington’s chaotic withdrawal from its disastrous 20-year war in Afghanistan, which critics quickly branded “Biden’s Afghan Blunder.” Yet that decision was more strategic than it first appeared. China had already been consolidating its dominance in Central Asia through multibillion-dollar development deals with nations around Afghanistan, like Pakistan, and even before that collapse in Kabul, geopolitical strangulation had forced the US military to send any air support for its ground forces there on a 2,000-mile round-trip flight from the Persian Gulf. Now, a full year later, with the US military facing serious challenges in both Ukraine and the Taiwan Strait, that once-controversial withdrawal seems almost strategically prescient.

At the western end of Eurasia, President Biden’s calibrated response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has not only repaired the damage done to NATO by Donald Trump’s attacks on the alliance but fostered a trans-Atlantic solidarity not seen since the coldest days of the Cold War. Apart from the joint effort to arm and train Ukraine’s military, there has been a fundamental, long-term shift in Europe’s energy imports with profound geopolitical implications. After the European Union (EU) reacted to Vladimir Putin’s invasion by banning imports of Russian coal and oil, while Moscow cut critical natural gas from its pipelines, the United States helped fill the breach by shipping 60 percent of its swelling natural gas exports to Europe.

To handle those fast-rising imports, the EU is spending countless billions on a crash program to build costly terminals for Liquified Natural Gas (LNG). To replace the 118 million tons of natural gas imported from Russia annually before the war, the EU is scrambling to double its current array of two-dozen LNG terminals, while simultaneously negotiating long-term contracts with producers in America, Australia, and Qatar to construct costly liquification plants (like the $25-billion Driftwood project now underway in Louisiana). With stunning speed, such massive investments at both ends of the energy supply chain are ensuring that Europe’s economic ties to Russia will never again be as significant.

At the eastern end of Eurasia, on the other hand, an ongoing dangerous stand-off with China over Taiwan is complicating Washington’s efforts to rebuild its Cold War strategic bastion in the Pacific. Last October, Chinese President Xi Jinping insisted that the “historical task of the complete reunification of the motherland must be fulfilled,” while, in May, President Biden announced his intention “to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan.” During her controversial August visit to that island, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi stated, “America’s determination to preserve democracy here in Taiwan…remains ironclad.” As China’s jets flood that island’s airspace and American warships steam defiantly through the Taiwan Strait, both powers have launched pell-mell naval construction programs. The US Navy is aiming to have at least 321 manned vessels, while China, with the world’s largest shipbuilding capacity, plans a battle force of 425 ships by 2030.

In recent years, China has relentlessly expanded across Asia economically, while building the world’s largest trading bloc, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. In the future, Beijing may even have the means to slowly draw some of America’s allies into its sphere of influence. While Japan still sees the US commitment to Taiwan as part of its own defense and South Korea has shed its usual ambiguity to issue a joint statement about “the importance of preserving peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,” other Asian allies like Australia and the Philippines have taken a more ambiguous position.

Should China launch an invasion of Taiwan—which, warns that island’s foreign minister, might well happen next year—the price of involvement for the United States could prove prohibitive. In a series of war game scenarios proposed by a Washington think tank last August, intervention to save Taiwan could cost the US Navy at least 79% of its forces, meaning something like two aircraft carriers, dozens of surface ships, and hundreds of aircraft.

The increasing unreliability of some of Washington’s allies is amply evident along Eurasia’s southern tier. As part of its ongoing strategic realignment, in 2017 Washington ended its 50-year alliance with Pakistan via a Trump tweet condemning Islamabad’s “lies and deceit.” Following Tokyo’s lead, Washington then forged a naval-oriented entente called the “Quad” with three other Asia-Pacific democracies—Australia, India, and Japan.

India is clearly the keystone in this loose alliance by virtue of its strategic position and its growing navy of 150 warships, including nuclear submarines and an aircraft carrier now under construction. Yet New Delhi’s ad hoc alliance with those kindred democracies is proving ambiguous at best. It has indeed hosted most of the Quad’s annual joint naval maneuvers aimed at checking China in the Indian Ocean. However, it has also joined the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a key instrument for advancing Beijing’s Eurasian ambitions. Indeed, it was at that organization’s meeting in Uzbekistan last month that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi publicly rebuked Vladimir Putin over his Ukraine invasion.

Countering the American array of alliances, China is—through its naval expansion and economic development initiatives—challenging Washington’s once-dominant position in the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific. Through its trillion-dollar infrastructure investments, Beijing is laying a steel grid of rails, roads, and pipelines across the breadth of Eurasia, matched by a string of 40 commercial ports it’s built or bought that now ring the coasts of Africa and Europe.

Already possessing the world’s largest (if not most powerful) navy, Beijing’s busy dockyards are constantly launching new warships and nuclear submarines. It also recently built its first major aircraft carrier. Moreover, it already has the second largest space network with more than 500 orbital satellites, while achieving a breakthrough in quantum cryptography by sending unhackable “entangled photon” messages more than 1,200 kilometers.

Reflecting its sharpening technological edge, according to the US Defense Intelligence Agency, China has developed sophisticated cyber and anti-satellite tactics to “counter a U.S. intervention during a regional military conflict.” And in July 2021, it conducted the world’s first “fractional orbital launch” of a hypersonic missile that circled the globe at an unstoppable speed of 3,800 miles per hour before striking within 24 miles of its target—ample accuracy for the nuclear payload it could someday carry. In short, the only certainty in any future US-China conflict over Taiwan would be unparalleled destruction as well as an unimaginable disruption of the global economy that would make the fighting in Ukraine seem like a border skirmish.

Environmental Cataclysm

And yet, stunningly enough, that’s not the worst news for Asia or the rest of the planet. The fast-building climate crisis poses a far greater threat. Last February, when the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its latest report, Secretary-General António Guterres called it “a damning indictment of failed climate leadership.”

In just a decade or two, when global warming reaches 1.5° Celsius, storms and drought will ravage farmlands in even more devastating ways than at present, while reefs that protect coasts will decline by up to 90 percent, and the population exposed to coastal flooding will increase by at least 20 percent. The cumulative changes are, in fact, mounting so rapidly, the UN warned, that they could soon overwhelm the capacity of humanity and nature to adapt, potentially yielding a planet that might, sooner or later, prove relatively uninhabitable.

In the six months following the release of that doomsday report, weather disasters erupting in Asia would give frightening weight to those dire words. In Pakistan, annual monsoon rains, turbocharged by warming seas, unleashed unprecedented floods that covered an unparalleled one-third of the country, displacing 33 million people and killing 1,700. Those waters ravaging its agricultural heartland are not even expected to fully recede for another six months.

While Pakistan is drowning, neighboring Afghanistan is suffering a prolonged drought that has brought six million people to the brink of famine, while scorching the country’s eastern provinces with wildfires. Similarly, in India, temperatures this summer averaged 109° to 115° Fahrenheit in 15 provinces and remained at that intolerable level in some cities for a record 27 days.

This summer, China similarly experienced staggering weather extremes, as the country’s worst recorded drought turned stretches of the great Yangtze River into mudflats, hydropower failures shuttered factories, and temperatures hit record highs. In other parts of the country, however, heavy floods unleashed lethal landslides and rivers ran so high that they changed course. By 2050, the north China plain, now home to 400 million people, is expected to experience killer heat waves and, by century’s end, could suffer weather extremes that would make it uninhabitable.

With world leaders now absorbed in military rivalries at both ends of Eurasia, once-promising international cooperation over climate change has virtually ceased. Only recently, in fact, China “suspended” all climate talks with the United States even though, as of 2020, those two powers were responsible for 44 percent of the world’s total carbon emissions.

Last November, just four months before the Ukraine war started, the two countries issued an historic declaration at the UN’s Glasgow Climate Change Conference recognizing the “urgency of the climate crisis” and stating that they were “committed to tackling it through their respective accelerated actions in the critical decade of the 2020s…to avoid catastrophic impacts.” To honor that commitment, China agreed to “phase down” (but not “phase out”) its reliance on coal starting in 2025, just as the United States promised “to reach 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035″—neither exactly a dream response to the crisis. Now, with no climate communication at all, things look grim indeed.

Not surprisingly, the collision of those geopolitical and environmental tempests represents a mind-boggling threat to the planet’s future, giving the very idea of a cold war turning into a hot war new meaning. Even if Beijing and Washington were to somehow avert armed conflict over Taiwan, the chill in their diplomatic relations is crippling the world’s already weak capacity to meet the challenge of climate change. Instead of the “win-win” that was the basis for effective US-China relations for nearly 30 years, the world is faced with circumstances that can only be called “lose-lose”—or worse."

The extreme heat that would cause tens of millions of people to migrate from areas that would be uninhabitable might not cause a catastrophe. Rising sea levels might not trigger massive flooding. A new report says it may be too late to prevent these things from happening. The climate conflagration so many scientists have worried about is all but inevitable.

A new report issued at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change shows that the earth will heat up by 2.1 to 2.9 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. While this cannot be avoided, it is possible for nations to prepare, but these preparations would need to be colossal.

It is hard to imagine how armies of people could be moved from some of the world’s largest cities, which include metropolitan areas in India. It is just as hard to imagine what could be an even larger number of people leaving coastal cities, which are located across the world and include some in the United States. Miami, for example, could be overwhelmed by rising seas. Three million people inhabit the area around Miami. While all these are not in sections of the state that would be flooded, homes and businesses worth billions of dollars may have to be abandoned.

Additionally, most large countries have barely tried to curtain emissions. This is certainly true of China and India. It is also somewhat true of the United States. In India’s case, it has sealed its fate as a country in which relocations of a large number of people may not be feasible. Where can a large number of people in large cities go to be moved inland? Infrastructure to house them and their businesses could not be built on such a scale.

434f432c-2c99-4722-b239-dcd7668bea7a,"Heatwaves driven by human-caused climate change have cost the global economy $16 trillion (£14 trillion) since the 1990s, a study has calculated.

This is due to the effects of high temperatures on human health, productivity and agricultural output.

It also revealed that the world's poorest and lowest carbon-emitting nations have suffered the largest economic blows, such as those in tropics.

Researchers at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, USA combined economic data with the average temperature for the hottest five-day period for each global region.

They found that, from 1992 to 2013, heatwaves have routinely coincided with variations in economic growth, which differ in high and low income regions.

'Almost no country on Earth has benefited from the extreme heat that has occurred,' said senior author Justin Mankin, an assistant professor of geography.

This plot shows the relationship between each country's average income and the effect that human-caused heat waves have had on their economy. Lower-income countries have emitted less CO2 and experienced greater losses from human-caused heat waves since the 1990s

From 1992 to 2013, heatwaves have routinely coincided with variations in economic growth, which differ in high and low income regions. Pictured: Lake Mead, Nevada, USA during drought in July

UK'S 2022 HEATWAVE WILL BE AN 'AVERAGE SUMMER' BY 2035, STUDY SAYS Research by the Met Office Hadley Centre claims that temperatures seen this summer in the UK will be an 'average summer' by 2035. This is even if countries meet climate commitments agreed under the 2015 Paris Agreement. The research looked at how rapidly temperatures are changing across Europe and tracked observed mean summer temperatures since 1850 against model predictions. It also found an average summer in central Europe by 2100 will be over 4°C hotter than it was in the pre-industrial era.

He added: 'Global events like the COVID-19 pandemic have revealed the close interconnectedness of the supply chain and the global economy.

'Low-income countries have disproportionate numbers of the outdoor workers who often generate the raw materials so crucial to the global supply chain — there is absolutely the potential for upward ripple effects.'

The authors claim that their work is among the first to specifically examine how heatwaves affect economic output.

'The true costs of climate change are far higher than we've calculated so far,' said Dr Mankin.

Previous studies have tended to focus on higher income regions, where both economic and climate data are more robust.

They also have classed heatwaves among other extreme events relating to climate change, like more frequent flooding and greater storm intensity.

However, heatwaves are unique in that they are more linked to the temperatures of the hottest days of the year than the global average temperature.

The former is projected to increase much quicker than the latter as human activity continues to drive climate change.

The modelling analysis, published today in Science Advances, used both annual average temperature and data from the five hottest days of the year.

This allowed for the interaction of the two while estimating the impact of extreme heat waves on economic output.

First author and PhD student Christopher Callahan said: 'Heatwaves are one of the most direct and tangible effects of climate change that people feel, yet they have not been fully integrated into our assessments of what climate change has cost and will cost in the future.'

The study also revealed that the world's poorest and lowest carbon-emitting nations have suffered the largest economic blows, such as those in tropics. Pictured: A boat man drinks from a water bottle during a hot day in Dhaka, Bangladesh this April

Effects of extreme heat on economic growth (p.p. per SD) for each region based on their average temperatures

The study revealed that extreme heatwaves led to a cumulative economic loss of between $5 trillion (£4.3 trillion) and $29.3 trillion (£25.3 trillion) globally from 1992 to 2013

Economic losses due to extreme heat events were also found to be lower for wealthier countries.

Over the 21 year study period, regions in the top income decile lost an average of 1.5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita due to heatwaves.

This included places in the United States, Canada and parts of Europe.

For regions in the bottom income decile, like parts of Brazil and Mali, this figure was 6.7 per cent of GDP per capita.

'Our work shows that no place is well adapted to our current climate,' said Dr Mankin.

Furthermore, the researchers found that wealthy subnational regions in Europe and North America could benefit economically by having periods of warmer days.

For example, these cooler countries could experience a boom in tourism, or even agricultural benefits.

They also have more resources to be resilient to periods of extreme heat, but are simultaneously among the biggest worldwide carbon emitters.

Dr Mankin said: 'It's a massive international wealth transfer from the poorest countries in the world to the richest countries in the world through climate change — and that transfer needs to be reversed.'

The researchers found that wealthy subnational regions in Europe and North America could benefit economically by having periods of warmer days. For example, these cooler countries could experience a boom in tourism, or even agricultural benefits. Pictured: People cool off near the Eiffel Tower during a heatwave in France in August 2022

The authors say their study highlights that the economic consequences of climate change, and the expense of adaptation, are being borne by the world's poorest nations in the tropics and Global South.

Most of these countries have also contributed the least to climate change through greenhouse gas emissions.

'As climate change increases the magnitude of extreme heat, it's a fair expectation that those costs will continue to accumulate,' said Dr Mankin.

There is an immediate need for policies and technologies that protect people during the hottest days of the year, particularly in low income regions, according to the researchers.

They say that their results prove that the world's principal emitters should foot large portions of the bill for adapting to extreme heat events.

'Targeting resources at heat resilience and early-warning capabilities for only a few days per year may yield disproportionate economic benefits,' they wrote.

This should be in addition to helping them develop low-emission economies, as it would benefit wealthy and developing nations alike.

Mr Callahan said: 'Accelerating adaptation measures within the hottest period of each year would deliver economic benefits now.

'The amount of money spent on adaptation measures should not be assessed just on the price tag of those measures, but relative to the cost of doing nothing.

'Our research identifies a substantial price tag to not doing anything.'"
22a950f1-5bf1-4e9e-9d8a-cbf1506c78b4,"Heat waves, intensified by climate change, have cost the global economy trillions of dollars in the past 30 years, a study published Friday found, with poor countries paying the steepest price.

And those lopsided economic effects contribute to widening inequalities around the world, according to the research.

""The cost of extreme heat from climate change so far has been disproportionately borne by the countries and regions least culpable for global warming,"" Dartmouth College professor Justin Mankin, one of the authors of the study published in the journal Science Advances, told AFP. ""And that's an insane tragedy.""

""Climate change is playing out on a landscape of economic inequality, and it is acting to amplify that inequality,"" he said.

Periods of extreme heat cost the global economy about $16 trillion between 1992 and 2013, the study calculated.

But while the richest countries have lost about 1.5% of their annual per capita GDPs dealing with heat waves, poorer countries have lost about 6.7% of their annual per capita GDPs.

The reason for that disparity is simple: poor countries are often situated closer to the tropics, where temperatures are warmer anyway. During heat waves, they become even hotter.

The study comes just days ahead of the start of the COP27 climate summit in Egypt, where the question of compensation for countries that are disproportionately vulnerable to but least responsible for climate change is expected to be one of the key topics.

The costs of heat waves come from several factors: effects on agriculture, strains on health systems, less productive workforces and physical damage to infrastructure, such as melting roads.

Study researchers examined five days of weather considered extreme for a specific region each year.

""The general idea is to use variation in extreme heat, which is effectively randomly assigned to all these economic regions and see the extent to which that accounts for variation in economic growth"" in a given region, Mankin explained.

""Then the second part is to say, 'OK, how has human-caused warming influenced extreme heat?'"" he added.

Despite these calculations, the study results almost certainly underestimate the true cost of extreme heat, according to the paper — only studying five days per year does not reflect the increased frequency of such heat events, and not all potential costs were included.

Previous studies on the subject had focused on the costs of heat to specific sectors, though scientists say it is important to look at the price tag of climate change wholistically.

""You want to know what those costs are, so that you have a frame of reference against which to compare the cost of action,"" Mankin said, such as establishing cooling centers or installing air conditioners, versus ""the cost of inaction.""

""The dividends economically of responding to the five hottest days of the year could be quite great,"" he said.

But according to Mankin, the most important response is to reduce carbon emissions to slow global warming at the source.

""We need to adapt to the climate we have now, and we also need to deeply invest in mitigation,"" he said."

Massive economic losses due to sweltering temperatures brought on by human-caused climate change are not just a problem for the distant future. A study in the journal Science Advances has found that more severe heat waves resulting from global warming have already cost the world economy trillions of dollars since the early 1990s—with the world's poorest and lowest carbon-emitting nations suffering the most.

Dartmouth College researchers combined newly available, in-depth economic data for regions worldwide with the average temperature for the hottest five-day period—a commonly used measurement of heat intensity—for each region in each year. They found that from 1992–2013, heat waves statistically coincided with variations in economic growth and that an estimated $16 trillion was lost to the effects of high temperatures on human health, productivity and agricultural output.

The findings stress the immediate need for policies and technologies that protect people during the hottest days of the year, particularly in the world's warmest, most economically vulnerable nations, the researchers report.

""Accelerating adaptation measures within the hottest period of each year would deliver economic benefits now,"" said first author Christopher Callahan, a doctoral candidate in geography at Dartmouth. ""The amount of money spent on adaptation measures should not be assessed just on the price tag of those measures, but relative to the cost of doing nothing. Our research identifies a substantial price tag to not doing anything.""

The study is the among the first to specifically examine how heat waves affect economic output, said senior author Justin Mankin, an assistant professor of geography at Dartmouth. ""No one has shown an independent fingerprint for extreme heat and the intensity of that heat's impact on economic growth. The true costs of climate change are far higher than we've calculated so far,"" Mankin said.

""Our work shows that no place is well adapted to our current climate,"" Mankin said. ""The regions with the lowest incomes globally are the ones that suffer most from these extreme heat events. As climate change increases the magnitude of extreme heat, it's a fair expectation that those costs will continue to accumulate.""

Climate models and previous research have included heat waves among other extreme events resulting from climate change, such as more frequent flooding and greater storm intensity, Callahan said. But heat waves have a unique signature, he said. They occur on shorter timescales than droughts and the temperatures of the hottest days of the year are projected to increase much quicker than the global average temperature as human activity continues to drive climate change.

""Heat waves are one of the most direct and tangible effects of climate change that people feel, yet they have not been fully integrated into our assessments of what climate change has cost and will cost in the future,"" Callahan said. ""We live in a world that has already been altered by greenhouse gas emissions. I think our research helps demonstrate that.""

The study results underscore issues of climate justice and inequality, Mankin and Callahan said. The economic costs of extreme heat—as well as the expense of adaptation—have been and will be disproportionately borne by the world's poorest nations in the tropics and the global South. Most of these countries have contributed the least to climate change.

The researchers found that while economic losses due to extreme heat events averaged 1.5% of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita for the world's wealthiest regions, low-income regions suffered a loss of 6.7% of GDP per capita. Furthermore, the study revealed that to a certain point, wealthy subnational regions in Europe and North America—which are among the world's biggest carbon emitters—could theoretically benefit economically by having periods of warmer days.

""We have a situation where the people causing global warming and changes in extreme heat have more resources to be resilient to those changes, and, in some rare cases, could benefit from it,"" Mankin said. ""It's a massive international wealth transfer from the poorest countries in the world to the richest countries in the world through climate change—and that transfer needs to be reversed.""

In July, Mankin and Callahan published a paper in the journal Climatic Change that assessed the economic damages individual countries have caused to others by their contributions to climate warming. The study presented the scientific basis nations need to assess their legal standing for claiming economic damages due to emissions and warming.

In this latest publication, Mankin and Callahan indicate that the world's principal emitters should foot large portions of the bill for adapting to extreme heat events, in addition to helping lower-income nations develop low-emission economies. In the global economy, sharing the costs of adaptation measures would benefit wealthy and developing nations alike, Mankin said.

""Almost no country on Earth has benefitted from the extreme heat that has occurred,"" Mankin said. ""Global events like the COVID-19 pandemic have revealed the close interconnectedness of the supply chain and the global economy. Low-income countries have disproportionate numbers of the outdoor workers who often generate the raw materials so crucial to the global supply chain—there is absolutely the potential for upward ripple effects.""

The paper, ""Globally unequal effect of extreme heat on economic growth,"" was published Oct. 28, 2022, in Science Advances."

A No 10 spokesperson said government advice was sought, as is “standard practice”, and it was agreed it was not the “right occasion” for Charles to visit in person. She said: As is standard practice, government advice was sought and provided under a previous PM, and it was unanimously agreed that it would not be the right occasion for the King to visit in person. She added she is “not aware” that the advice has changed. The environment secretary, Thérèse Coffey, claimed this morning that it was up to the King whether he attends the climate summit in Egypt next month. She told Sky News: I think it’s up to him. I know that he takes an interest in this particular issue, but it’s up to him. Downing Street said the government remains “absolutely committed” to leading international action on climate change despite Rishi Sunak’s absence at Cop27. Asked about the former culture secretary Nadine Dorries’ tweet that it was wrong for Sunak to skip the conference, the No 10 spokesperson said: We are facing serious economic challenges. The prime minister is focused on dealing with those issues, and the public, I think, would also expect him to be in the country ... dealing with those ahead of the autumn statement. But we’re also very clear that the public should also judge us by our actions and we are forging ahead of many other countries on net zero, for example.

28 Oct 2022 03.00 AEDT Summary of today's developments Rishi Sunak has come under scrutiny from opposition ministers and environmental groups, who called his decision not to attend Cop27 a “failure” and said it brought into question government commitments to prioritise net zero and tackle the climate crisis.

King Charles is free to decide whether or not to attend the Cop27 climate summit, the new environment secretary, Thérèse Coffey , has said as she defended the decision of the prime minister not to go. Earlier this month, sources told the Guardian the king would not attend the international gathering in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, after reports that the former prime minister, Liz Truss, had intervened.

The UK’s windfall tax on oil and gas profits must be changed to raise billions more and to stop companies using loopholes to invest in further fossil fuel extraction, the outgoing president of global climate talks, Alok Sharma, has said.

The government has delayed publication of clean water and biodiversity targets, putting it in breach of its Environment Act, ministers have admitted. Coffey published a written ministerial statement on Friday confirming that the targets underpinning the country’s nature recovery would not be released on 31 October as promised.

Sunak has dropped his Conservative leadership campaign pledge to fine patients £10 if they miss a GP or hospital appointment. The prime minister had told Tory members in August it was “wrong” that there are “15m missed appointments every year NHS” at GPs and hospitals, as he justified the fine as a “tough” measure to change people’s behaviour.

Sunak got a taste of how the “difficult decisions” he has said will guide spending cuts may go down with the public, when he was challenged by a hospital patient about nurses’ pay. When 77-year old Catherine Poole was asked by Sunak if the staff had looked after “really nicely”, she looked him straight in the eye and replied: “They always do. It is a pity you don’t pay them more.”

Sunak refused to deny suggestions that officials warned him against reappointing Suella Braverman as home secretary. He said he was confident Braverman had “learned from her mistake” and insisted he does not regret the appointment.

Northern Ireland is on course for a snap election after a recall of the Stormont assembly failed to elect a speaker and break political deadlock. The Northern Ireland secretary, Chris Heaton-Harris, said he is “extremely disappointed” that a last-ditch effort to restore the multiparty executive at Stormont failed.



28 Oct 2022 02.36 AEDT Nicola Sturgeon will travel to Egypt for the Cop27 climate summit, the Scottish government has announced. A spokesperson for the Scottish government told PA news agency: Given the vital importance of governments working together to tackle climate change, it is the first minister’s intention to attend Cop27.

We ought to be going further and seeing what more can be done in terms of raising additional finance [from the profits]. So far, at least, the level of money raised is obviously not significant. The UK is facing a cost of living crisis and the Treasury needs to fill an estimated £50bn hole in the country’s finances.

No 10 published the video on Twitter on Friday morning with the caption: “Together we can achieve incredible things. Now let’s get to work.” The video features backing music that many on social media said was strikingly similar to Glitter’s hit song Rock ‘n’ Roll. Glitter, 76, whose name is Paul Gadd, was jailed in 2015 for 16 years for attempted rape, unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under 13, and four counts of indecent assault. In 2002, he was expelled from Cambodia over unspecified allegations, and in March 2006 he was convicted of sexually abusing two girls, aged 10 and 11, in Vietnam. The prime minister’s spokesperson said “stock music” was used for the backing track. She added: “I’m not aware of it costing anything additional to the work that we do in communicating for the prime minister.” Together we can achieve incredible things.

The Labour leader said people were already “paying the price” for government mistakes, after reports that a buffer in the public finances could be created by trying to claw back £50bn – significantly greater than the expected £35bn fiscal black hole. A long-awaited statement laying out the plans was pushed back by Sunak from 31 October to 17 November, and the chancellor is holding meetings with cabinet ministers this week to discuss where the axe should fall. Seeking to tie Sunak to the economic chaos caused by his predecessor, Liz Truss, Starmer said during a visit to a school in Thurrock: “We were not even talking about cuts a month ago.” He added: “The whole discussion about cuts has become an issue only because the government has crashed the economy.” Tories have ‘crashed the economy’ says Starmer amid calls for election Read more

28 Oct 2022 23.49 AEDT Rishi Sunak has suggested Suella Braverman “raised” the issue of her security breach with him while he discussed reappointing her as home secretary, in an apparent clarification of the account he gave to MPs. The prime minister sparked a backlash by bringing Braverman back into the cabinet despite the fact she had quit only days before, having been caught sending a Tory backbencher a sensitive document from a personal email account, twice breaching the ministerial code. Speaking in the Commons on Wednesday, he said she had “recognised” her “error of judgment” and “raised the matter”, which some interpreted to mean she reported her own mistake prior to her departure, rather than being presented with the evidence – a position which seems to have been contradicted by the former Tory party chair Sir Jake Berry. But on Friday, Sunak appeared to suggest he was actually referring to a conversation he had with Braverman while considering whether to return her to the role. Labour had called for him to “swiftly” clarify the circumstances surrounding the row, saying he must “correct the record” if he misled parliament. Speaking to broadcasters during a visit to Croydon university hospital, he said Braverman “raised” the issue with him while he discussed her reappointment. “Now, as I said in parliament earlier this week, she raised this topic with me when I discussed reappointing her as home secretary and I’m confident that she’s learned from her mistake,” he said. He also again declined to deny suggestions officials warned him against reinstating Braverman, insisting he does not regret the move. “The home secretary has acknowledged the mistake, she’s recognised she made a mistake, she’s taken accountability for that and that’s the right thing,” he said.

The U.K. hosted the last such summit, COP26, when it stressed the importance of global leaders convening to discuss climate change amid growing criticism of their failure to meet vital carbon reduction targets.

Sunak’s decision came on the same day the United Nations warned that countries’ climate pledges leave the world on track to heat by a potentially calamitous 2.6 degrees Celsius this century."
48c6e74b-87a0-42b6-b22d-1b61132daea5,Earlier this month a royal source said Buckingham Palace had sought government advice about the summit and it was unanimously agreed it would not be right for Charles to visit in person. The Sunday Times newspaper reported he had been told not to go by then prime minister Liz Truss.
48290286-5c9c-49f7-9530-7a584776a71b,"LONDON (Reuters) -It would be ""very powerful"" if King Charles attended the COP27 climate summit in Egypt, U.S. special climate envoy John Kerry said, adding that the British monarch's credibility and leadership on environmental issues would make a difference.

Charles, who became king last month following the death of his mother Queen Elizabeth, spoke at the opening ceremony of the 2021 summit in Glasgow, which he described as a ""last chance saloon"" to save the world from climate change.

Earlier this month a royal source said Buckingham Palace had sought government advice about the summit and it was unanimously agreed it would not be right for Charles to visit in person. The Sunday Times newspaper reported at the time he had been told not to go by then prime minister Liz Truss.

A spokeswoman for new Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on Friday she was not aware the advice provided under the previous government had changed.

""I think it's very helpful to have leaders of countries be in Sharm el-Sheikh, representative leaders whether it is the government or monarchy, I think it would be terrific,"" Kerry told Sky News late on Thursday when asked if the king's presence would help proceedings.

""I know that his being there would make a difference ... because he has credibility, because he has been a long-term leader,"" said Kerry, U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate.

Sunak's office has said he will not be attending.

Sunak said on Friday he was proud of the government's record on tackling climate change and Britain had shown leadership on the issue, but he was focussed on domestic issues ahead of a major fiscal statement next month.

""I'm very personally committed to it, and I just think at the moment it is right that I am also focusing on the pressing domestic challenges we have with the economy,"" he told reporters.

Opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer criticised Sunak's decision.

""Many people would be expecting the prime minister of the UK not just to attend COP but to use it as an opportunity to pull world leaders together,"" he said. ""If that doesn't happen it's a failure of leadership.""

1e1c1914-fbc6-44a1-9046-c3726b70f7ef,"Human-caused climate change made everyday temperatures warmer for 7.6 billion people last year, according to a new analysis by research and news nonprofit Climate Central.

The big picture: Impacts of the warming planet on daily temperatures are being felt by roughly 96% of the world's population, with the strongest influences in cities across the Global South.

Context: Climate Central researchers measured the influence of climate change on daily average temperatures for 1,021 major global cities between Oct. 1, 2021 and Sept. 30, 2022.

They used the organization's newly expanded ""Climate Shift Index,"" which quantifies how much climate change has altered the likelihood of daily average temperatures at locations worldwide.

What they found: On any given day over the last year, at least 200 million people experienced temperatures that climate change made more likely, the analysis shows.

Cities in small island developing states — a group of island countries in the Caribbean, Pacific, Atlantic, Indian Ocean and South China Sea — had the highest average CSI scores, meaning climate change has had the clearest influence on their day-to-day temperatures over the last year.

When considering total population size, human exposure to daily temperatures altered by climate change was at its highest in the urban environments of Lagos, Nigeria, Mexico City, Mexico and Singapore.

Between the lines: The places experiencing the biggest impacts of climate change on daily temperatures are in developing countries that have contributed little to global warming.

How it works: The CSI of a place is calculated by incorporating peer-reviewed methods and weather data to estimate how often the temperature at that location is likely to occur in the current climate, as well as the likelihood in a world without climate change. (The analysis itself wasn't peer-reviewed.)

""We do a really direct comparison of a world with and without extra CO2,"" Andrew Pershing, director of climate science at Climate Central, told Axios.

What they're saying: Stephanie Herring, a climate attribution scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who wasn't involved with the project, told Axios in an email that the CSI tool is unique because it focuses on the impact of climate change on daily temperatures, while most attribution research looks at extremes.

The tool shows that ""climate change isn't just showing up in the most extreme, one in a hundred year heat events,"" Herring wrote. ""We can see the impact in our everyday lives.""

Our thought bubble: With COP27 just around the corner — and loss and damage payments for developing nations likely on the agenda — these findings further magnify the unequal impacts of climate change."
484d723e-d4ca-4638-bc6e-62b1fb8cd677,"If temperatures are soaring at the World Cup in Qatar next month, spectators and athletes will be able to look online and see if climate change is to blame.

That’s thanks to the Climate Shift Index, an online tool that allows weather forecasters and residents to see how greenhouse gas emissions are affecting daily temperatures. A version of the index that tracks temperatures in the continental U.S. launched this summer. Today, Climate Central, the nonprofit climate science organization that developed the index, released a broader version that allows users to see how global warming is influencing local temperatures anywhere around the world.

The index works through a bit of clever statistics—every day, a computer system compares current temperatures around the world to historical data and the output of dozens of climate models in order to determine how likely those conditions would be in a world without humanity’s greenhouse gas emissions—and how much more likely a century of burning fossil fuels may have made them.

The index presents those findings on a color-coded map: Yellow means global warming made current temperatures 1.5 times more likely; dark red indicates that the current temperatures were five times likelier to occur due to climate change, an “exceptional” climate fingerprint.

The rollout of the worldwide Climate Shift Index is the latest project in the growing field of attribution science, where climate scientists attempt to show connections between weather events and rising greenhouse gas emissions. Some such analyses, such as figuring out the role climate change might have played in a major heat wave, used to be difficult, months-long affairs, but scientists have worked to speed up and standardize the methods in recent years.

Now, attributing regional or local temperature to climate change is relatively straightforward scientifically, which is why the Climate Shift Index is able to run through the calculations for all the world’s temperatures every day. Doing the same for other weather, like rainfall, is more difficult, and requires more time. Proving out the full extent of climate change’s impact on the most extreme weather events also requires more specialized analysis, such as in the case of the Pacific Northwest heat dome last summer, which scientists at World Weather Attribution concluded would have been “virtually impossible,” without the effects of human-caused climate change.

The work on the global Climate Shift Index has led to some interesting—and troubling—findings. The researchers who developed the tool examined weather data from the past year and found that climate change affected temperatures for 96% of the world’s population. But the effects were especially strong near the equator, and on small islands where warmer ocean waters are boosting temperatures on land. “It’s just really clear that in a lot of those places they’re dealing with climates that are just permanently altered from what they were before,” says Andrew Pershing, the director of climate science at Climate Central.

The hope now is that people will be able to use the Climate Shift Index to see climate change impacts that may have otherwise gone unnoticed—a balmy winter day in Stockholm, for instance, might have a dark red signature on the Climate Shift Index map. It can also help illustrate just how widespread those effects are, showing where climate change is bringing extreme heat, even beyond those few heat waves that make international news. “There were events in other places [last year] that didn’t get the same level of attention, even though they had arguably as much or more of an impact on people,” says Pershing. “We’re hoping the tool will help people see those events more clearly.”

Whether they realized it or not, some 7.6 billion people—96 percent of humanity—felt global warming's impact on temperatures over the last 12 months, researchers have said.

But some regions felt it far more sharply and frequently than others, according to a report based on peer-reviewed methods from Climate Central, a climate science think tank.

People in tropical regions and on small islands surrounded by heat-absorbing oceans were disproportionately impacted by human-induced temperature increases to which they barely contributed.

Among the 1,021 cities analyzed between September 2021 and October 2022, the capitals of Samoa and Palau in the South Pacific have been experiencing the most discernible climate fingerprints, the researchers said in the report, released on Thursday.

Spiking temperatures in these locations were commonly four to five times more likely to occur than in a hypothetical world in which global warming had never happened.

Lagos, Mexico City and Singapore were among the most highly exposed major cities, with human-induced heat increasing health risks to millions.

Researchers at Climate Central, led by chief scientist Ben Strauss, looked for a way to bridge the gap between planetary-scale global warming—usually expressed as Earth's average surface temperature compared to an earlier reference period—to people's day-to-day experience.

""Diagnosing climate fingerprints lets people know that their experiences are symptoms of climate change,"" Strauss told AFP. ""It represents a signal and shows we must adapt.""

Using seven decades of high-resolution daily temperature data from the European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and two dozen climate models, Strauss and his team created a tool—the Climate Shift Index.

The tool calculates the likelihood that unusually warm weather at a specific location on any given day is due to climate change.

In 26 cities, for example, at least 250 of the 365 days from October 2021 saw temperature increases that were at least three times more likely due to climate change.

'Unfair and tragic'

Most of these cities were in east Africa, Mexico, Brazil, small island states, and the Malay Archipelago—a string of some 25,000 islands belonging to Indonesia and the Philippines.

""The effect of warming is much more noticeable in the equatorial belt because there has been historically less temperature variability there,"" Strauss told AFP.

This is why even a relatively modest rise in local temperatures brought on by global warming registers so clearly on the index, he explained.

""Island temperatures are strongly shaped by the temperature of the ocean around them,"" said Strauss, who has also mapped the projected impacts of sea level rise on coastal areas worldwide.

""To see that small island states have essentially already lost their historical climates—even as they face losing their land from rising seas—feels very unfair and tragic.""

The urgent need for money to help vulnerable tropical nations adapt to climate impacts will be squarely on the table when nearly 200 countries meet in 10 days for United Nations climate talks in Egypt.

Rich nations have yet to honor a decade-old pledge to ramp up climate financing for developing nations to $100 billion per year, even though the UN's climate advisory panel, the IPCC, estimates that annual adaptation costs could hit one trillion dollars by 2050 if warming continues apace.

New York Times columnist David Wallace-Wells wrote in a Wednesday article that “apocalyptic” predictions for drastic climate change from scientists were way off.

“Just a few years ago, climate projections for this century looked quite apocalyptic, with most scientists warning that continuing ‘business as usual’ would bring the world four or even five degrees Celsius of warming,” the article read.

“Acknowledging that truly apocalyptic warming now looks considerably less likely than it did just a few years ago pulls the future out of the realm of myth and returns it to the plane of history: contested, combative, combining suffering and flourishing — though not in equal measure for every group,” Wallace-Wells wrote.

In 2017 Wallace-Wells explored a “doomsday” scenario in which he predicted temperatures could rise by about five degrees Celsius over a century.

“If your anxiety about global warming is dominated by fears of sea-level rise, you are barely scratching the surface of what terrors are possible,” Wallace-Wells wrote in New York Magazine. “If the planet is five degrees warmer at the end of the century, we may have as many as 50 percent more people to feed and 50 percent less grain to give them,” he continued.

In his article Wednesday, Wallace-Wells lowered his predictions for climate warming to an increase of two degrees Celsius.

“Now, with the world already 1.2 degrees hotter, scientists believe that warming this century will most likely fall between two or three degrees,” Wallace-Wells wrote, citing a United Nations report.

“At four degrees, the impacts of warming appeared overwhelming, but at two degrees, the impacts would not be the whole of our human fate, only the landscape on which a new future will be built,” he continued."
b30eb69b-4b4a-4797-b3b3-225ce369ff61,"The world is falling into an “abyss of risk”, said Prof Johan Rockström of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. Reports published this week by three UN agencies all point to the failure of governments to make – and keep – sufficient commitments to ensure that global temperatures will not rise by more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, which was the target in the 2015 Paris agreement. This is the worst possible news, and arrives just a week before this year’s round of climate talks, Cop27, is due to open in Egypt.

So far human activities have raised the temperature by around 1C on average. If current pledges on emissions are fulfilled, that figure is expected to rise to 2.5C. That would – and probably will – mean destruction on a scale that is hard to imagine, even after what we have already witnessed, most recently with devastating floods in Pakistan but also record-breaking heatwaves and other extreme weather elsewhere.

Optimists came away from Cop26 in Glasgow believing that unsteady progress there – particularly in the crucial area of US-China cooperation – could be built on afterwards. Those hopes have now been dashed, with only 24 countries submitting new plans, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs), over the past year – and even the adjusted pledges falling short of what is needed. Climate tipping points including the collapse of the Greenland ice shelf, scientists warn, are becoming unavoidable, with rises in methane emissions in 2021 a particular source of alarm. Gloomily, experts note that Russia’s war on Ukraine and worsening relations between the west and China are likely to make reaching agreement at this year’s conference even harder. Oil companies’ profits are soaring.

In the UK, the new prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has made a terrible decision not to go to Cop27. Given that the UK held the Cop presidency this year, Greenpeace’s Rebecca Newsom was right to liken this no-show to “a runner failing to turn up with the baton” in a relay race. Mr Sunak’s comment that “everyone should be really proud” of what the UK has achieved so far suggests that he is alarmingly out of touch with the rising threat. Over recent days, reports from Prof Dame Jenny Harries and parliament’s joint national security committee have highlighted the multiple risks to the UK from climate change. Pointing to a lack of contingency planning for weather-sensitive infrastructure, the committee referred to a “gaping hole” at the heart of government.

Giving up on further progress via the UN process, and by other means including new taxes on oil companies, is not an option. Global heating of 2.5C is a terrifying prospect, especially for the millions of people who live in the places most dangerously exposed to sea-level rises. But it is a less terrifying prospect than the 2.7C of warming that would have followed from the Glasgow pledges. What has happened over the past year is disappointing and inadequate, but can and must be built upon. And amid this week’s grim news, a crumb of comfort came from the International Energy Agency, which believes high energy prices caused by the war in Ukraine are hastening the transition to clean energy.

Even people who understand fully the risks from climate change are sometimes reluctant to publicise them. Transformation of the global energy system, combined with a package of financial support for the global south from the north, is arguably more likely to be achieved if people believe that a greener future is within reach. With the head of the UN, António Guterres, predicting “a global catastrophe”, this week that future looks horribly distant. But the struggle continues."
9f9db630-ddd2-43fd-8a9a-4c031f87352a,"It has been an alarming time for climate scientists. One by one, the grim scenarios they had outlined for the near future have been overtaken by events: extreme storms, droughts, floods and ice-sheet collapses whose sudden appearances have outstripped researchers’ worst predictions. Catastrophic climate change is happening more rapidly and with greater intensity than their grimmest warnings, it transpires.

Examples include this summer’s record high temperature of 40.3C in the UK, a massive jump of 1.6C on the previous hottest day; torrential rains that triggered the most severe flooding in Pakistan’s recent history; and last year’s Hurricane Ida, one of the most destructive storms to have struck the US.

It is not that global temperatures have risen faster than expected. The problem is that the effect of this rise has been unexpectedly extreme.

“Many of the impacts of climate change such as increased weather extremes are now playing out faster than predicted, even though the warming itself is very much in line with model projections,” said the American climatologist Michael E Mann, of Pennsylvania University.

This point was backed by Johan Rockström, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.

“Without doubt, extreme weather events, amplified by global warming, are coming faster than predicted and are more severe than predicted. The impacts are there to see: the disastrous floods in Pakistan; the failure of the rainy season in Somalia for the past four years; and highly destructive wildfires in California,” he said.

These unanticipated events are occurring in a world that is currently 1.2C hotter than it was in pre-industrial times and temperatures are likely to continue to rise considerably despite nations pledging at recent IPCC summits to do everything to hold increases to 1.5C.

This figure could be breached in a decade, say scientists. The result will be even worse droughts, heatwaves, floods and disease patterns than those now being experienced.

But that is not all, says Rockström. He and his colleagues have recently published research that indicates that by the time a global temperature rise of 1.5C is reached there would be a significant risk to four major systems. “These systems include the Greenland ice sheet and the West Antarctic ice sheet, which will start to disintegrate,” added Rockström. “The end result will be sea level rises of several metres though that could take many, many decades.”

In addition, the permafrost systems of Canada and Russia would start to thaw and release their vast stores of methane, a greenhouse gas many times more potent and dangerous than carbon dioxide. Finally, at temperature rises of about 1.5C, all of the planet’s tropical coral reef systems would start to collapse, the group found.

“It would mean that we would be handing over to our children and to all future generations, a planet that will be sliding irreversibly towards possessing fewer and fewer places to live,” Rockström said.

The planet is teetering on the brink of meteorological disaster, giving a desperate edge to the opening of the Cop27 climate summit in Egypt next month. The task facing delegates was starkly underlined by the UN which reported last week that the world was now on track for a 2.8C rise in global temperatures. It also accused nations of wasting a year because they failed to deliver ambitious emissions pledges that had been made at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow last year.

This point was stressed by Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment. “Climate change is already damaging millions of lives around the world, including the UK, and is an increasing threat to the economic development of poor countries in particular. It is critical that governments at the Cop27 summit recognise that the risks of loss and damage are accelerating.”

Scientists warn that if the world is to have a chance of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and so prevent the breaching of the 1.5C limit, global emissions will have to be cut by 5% to 7% a year. At present, emissions are rising between 1% and 2% a year with little sign of that increase being halted.

Finding routes to carbon cuts should therefore be a priority for Cop27, scientists insist. However the summit is expected to be dominated by contentious discussions about the compensation that poorer nations believe richer nations should pay them for the impact of climate change. Global heating has been caused by industrial nations that used fossil fuels to make themselves rich. The argument is that they should now reimburse those countries that are suffering from the worst vicissitudes of climate change.

These are known as “loss and damage” claims and they will be a key focus of next month’s summit.

“You can imagine what will happen when the Pakistan delegation presents its claim for compensation for floods that have just put a third of their country under water,” said Rockström.

“You can imagine the number on that invoice. And I think developing countries have a really justified argument in making these loss and damage claims. But it is not going to be a very constructive debate because it’s very difficult to move forward on an agenda item like that.”

This point was backed by Professor Stephen Belcher, chief scientist at the UK Met Office. “At this point, the need for action is clear,” he told the Observer. “There is still time, but my gosh, the window of opportunity is closing fast.”

Delegates from nearly 200 nations, as well as hundreds of activists and representatives from nongovernmental organizations that focus on climate change and the environment, are convening in November in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, for the UN climate negotiations, known as the Conference of the Parties (COP). At this year’s version, COP27, nations will once again work together to achieve the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement, which requires each country to submit a detailed plan to reduce its emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. The UN gathers these binding commitments, known as Nationally Determined Contributions, to establish what the collective impact will be. In accordance with the Paris treaty, nations agreed to submit their NDCs by 2020 and then report back every five years. The plan was to ramp up commitments in successive years. And change is needed soon: The Paris Agreement reminds us that 2030 is the critical year by which global CO2 emissions must have been reduced by 45 percent to avoid the irreversible consequences of climate change.

In fact, earlier this year, the United Nations stated that emissions need to have peaked by 2025, be reduced by 43 percent by 2030, and be at net zero by 2050. Unfortunately, according to a new report released by the World Resources Institute, the commitments made so far will reduce emissions only 7 percent from 2019 levels by 2030. This reflects a shortcoming of the Paris Agreement: Some nations could ride the coattails of the commitments made by other nations and thus avoid making significant cuts themselves.

The goal is to keep the increase in global temperature to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and ideally to 1.5°C (2.7°F). The mantra of Pacific Islanders—“1.5 to stay alive!”—bespeaks the reality that any greater increase in temperature would lead to a rise in sea levels that would threaten the survival of island nations around the world.

Finance is also a key topic at COP27. The Paris Agreement aims to ensure that funds and technology will be transferred from “developed” (in UN-speak) to “developing” nations. The latter are already experiencing the effects of climate change, often disproportionately and with fewer resources to address them. In 2009, developed nations agreed to pay $100 billion each year to developing nations until 2020 to support mitigation and adaptation. That promise went largely unfulfilled.

Since wealthier nations have not made good on those commitments, developing nations have demanded what is referred to as “loss and damages” at the UN negotiations. It is what it sounds like: compensation for loss (irreversible) and for damages (reparable). (G20 member nations produce 80 percent of global emissions.)

The Vulnerable 20, or V20, a group of nations (now numbering 58) that are the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, have put forward a range of proposals to raise funds, either for mitigation and adaptation or loss and damages, ranging from taxes on fossil fuels to taxes on flying. V20 nations are experiencing the double whammy of debt and the costs related to the climate crisis. According to a recent report, the incomes of V20 nations have been reduced by a projected 20 percent in the past two decades because of the effects of climate change. Thus they have also demanded that the debt of poorer countries be restructured and have threatened to stop payments on these debts unless wealthier nations pay the promised amounts for mitigation and adaptation and for loss and damages. These demands, which have come from many island nations in the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean, are sure to grow louder over the course of COP27.

Lastly, while these topics will be negotiated inside COP27, demands to address the human rights violations of Egypt’s el-Sisi regime have been increasing. Attention has already been brought to this issue by public figures like Naomi Klein and Greta Thunberg, and an online petition has been signed by hundreds of organizations and activists. As Klein recently wrote at The Intercept, while Egypt might be attempting to improve its image ahead of COP27, it is “greenwashing a police state.” She called attention to the imprisonment of Alaa Abd El Fattah and more than 60,000 other political prisoners.

Global climate activists have spoken up in support of the release of Abd El Fattah, who has been on a hunger strike for over 200 days. Not surprisingly, many are from countries that are under right-wing leadership, such as Brazil and the Philippines, who know from personal experience what is at risk and the importance of speaking up. A thread runs through and weaves together these negotiations and movements, which is one for justice, whether it’s framed as social, political, or climate justice. They are all related and sure to be part of the interwoven demands at this year’s conference."

Human rights are being “negatively impacted” and “violated” due to the consequences of climate change, a top UN expert has said.

Ian Fry, the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights in the context of climate change, said that this includes the right to life, health, food, development, self-determination, water and sanitation, work, adequate housing and freedom from violence, sexual exploitation, trafficking and slavery.

In a report presented to the UN’s General Assembly on Friday, Mr Fry said that human-induced climate change is the “most pervasive threat” to the world and the poorest societies are paying the heaviest price.

He said: “There is an enormous injustice being manifested by developed economies against the poorest and least able to cope. Inaction by developed economies and major corporations to take responsibility for drastically reducing their greenhouse gas emissions has led to demands for ‘climate reparations’ for losses incurred.

“The G20 members for instance, account for 78 per cent of emissions over the last decade.”

Fry said that actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions were “inadequate” and creating a “human rights catastrophe”.

The UN expert also raised concerns about climate rights defenders, and in particular indigenous peoples, who have been the target of human rights abuses.

He added: “As groups and communities become increasingly frustrated with the lack of action on climate change, they have turned to protests and public interventions to bear witnesses to the climate emergency.

“Sadly, we are seeing many climate rights defenders persecuted by governments and security organisations. Some defenders have even been killed.”

Fry said the those most affected by climate change and suffering “the greatest losses” are not being involved enough in decision-making and he urged policymakers to involve “children and youth, women, persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples and minorities.”

“The overall effect of inadequate actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is creating a human rights catastrophe, and the costs of these climate change related disasters are enormous,” Mr Fry said.

In August, the United Nations Human Rights Council recognised the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment as a human right.

And just last month, the Council of Europe urged its 46 member states to also recognise a sustainable environment as a human right."
0a073aed-120c-494b-b72f-71493042fc9d,"© Provided by Times Now un chief antonio guterres calls for climate action on all fronts

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has urged the international community to take climate actions on all fronts, warning the window to limit global temperature rise is closing fast.

Guterres made the remarks in a video message on the release of the latest Emissions Gap Report by UN Environment Programme (UNEP) on Thursday, Xinhua news agency reported.

The report showed that under current Nationally Determined Contributions, the climate action plan to cut national emissions, the world is headed for 2.8 degrees Celsius of global heating by the end of the century.

""As today's report makes clear, we are headed for economy-destroying levels of global heating,"" he said. ""We need climate action on all fronts -- and we need it now.""

Guterres called on the international community to act to end reliance on fossil fuels, avoid a lock-in of new fossil fuel infrastructure and invest massively in renewables, citing the UNEP report's recommendations.

Developed countries must lead in boosting their national climate plans, the UN chief said, noting that emerging economies need financial and technical support to step up their climate actions."
787b8bf2-713a-4473-8920-b82ed30e5aec,"The Energy Crisis Could Actually Be Good for the Climate

In the world of climate change, we’ll take all the good news we can get. The energy crisis kicked off by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine earlier this year could represent a “historic turning point” for ending the world’s reliance on fossil fuels, the world’s top energy agency said this week.

A report from the International Energy Agency issued Thursday finds that global fossil fuel use could peak in the next few years following aggressive investments in clean energy during the crisis this year. This 2022 edition of the World Energy Outlook, as the IEA’s annual report is known, grapples with the enormous consequences of and fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in March.

The war in Europe, which kicked off amid already-high oil prices, cut off a major supply of Russian natural gas to Europe and has had real consequences on gas prices and overall energy prices around the world. As the first winter for Europe without Russian gas supplies approaches, world powers are scrambling to find alternative sources of energy. Fossil fuel majors including the U.S. have been expanding production to make up for the shortfall, leading some analysts to speculate that the war could increase reliance on gas and oil as more drilling infrastructure is created.

But over the long term, the IEA predicts, the crisis may prove to be the kick in the pants the world needs to wean itself off dirty energy. The IEA report predicts that global carbon emissions are on track to peak in 2025, thanks to huge government investments in green energy following the invasion.

“The environmental case for clean energy needed no reinforcement,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in a statement. “But the economic arguments in favour of cost-competitive and affordable clean technologies are now stronger – and so too is the energy security case. Today’s alignment of economic, climate and security priorities has already started to move the dial towards a better outcome for the world’s people and for the planet.”

The IEA report looks at energy use out to 2050 and how it’s predicted to shift; the phaseout will affect different forms of fossil fuels in various ways. Coal will be the first to go, with demand expected to decrease over the next few years. Demand for natural gas, the IEA predicts, will plateau by the end of the 2020s, while oil demand will flatten in the mid 2030s, thanks in large part to the coming boom in electric vehicles.

Oil and gas interests and their allies, especially in the U.S., have falsely attempted to blame high energy prices partially on climate policies. But the IEA’s analysis found “scant evidence” to support claims from the right that climate policies were in any way responsible for high energy prices, instead documenting how increased renewable use in some regions has led to lower electricity prices and how other changes, like efficient homes, can help offset high prices. (The buffer these changes provide, the report notes, is “far from enough” for many of the world’s poorest, who are suffering the most from the increased costs of energy.)

The news isn’t all rosy. Even with the rapid and aggressive changes being made due to the crisis, the IEA said, the shift away from fossil fuels is happening far too slowly. The IEA found that, even with fossil fuel use peaking in 2025 and nations implementing more aggressive shifts to renewables, the world is still on track to warm 2.5 degrees Celsius by 2100, figures that are roughly in line with separate findings released this week from the United Nations.

“It’s notable that many of these new clean energy targets aren’t being put in place solely for climate change reasons,” Birol told the New York Times in an interview. “Increasingly, the big drivers are energy security as well as industrial policy — a lot of countries want to be at the leading edge of the energy industries of the future.”"
248e5f67-652f-4d72-8090-41186ef1033b,"""One of the effects of Russia's actions is that the era of rapid growth in natural gas demand draws to a close,"" the IEA said, pointing to a rise in global demand for gas of less than 5 per cent between last year and 2030."

The drop in Russian fossil fuel exports after its Ukraine invasion will transform the global energy landscape for decades and can help to hasten a green energy transition, the International Energy Agency (IEA) says.

The IEA’s annual World Energy Outlook acknowledges the economic hit from reduced supplies of Russian oil, natural gas and coal but is keeping an environmental best-case scenario in which no investment in new fossil fuel projects is needed.

The IEA’s report said the global energy crisis is causing profound and long-lasting changes that could hasten the transition to a more sustainable and secure energy system.

“Energy markets and policies have changed as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, not just for the time being, but for decades to come,” said IEA executive director Fatih Birol on Thursday.

“The energy world is shifting dramatically before our eyes. Government responses around the world promise to make this a historic and definitive turning point towards a cleaner, more affordable and more secure energy system”, Birol added.

Short-term gaps created by the reduction in fossil fuel supplies from Russia will need to be plugged from elsewhere.

The strongest candidates are projects with “short lead times” which rapidly bring oil and gas supplies to market without locking in dependency.

Global clean energy investment is set to rise to more than $US2 trillion ($3 trillion) a year by 2030, up by half from current levels, while “international energy markets undergo a profound reorientation in the 2020s as countries adjust to the rupture of Russia-Europe (energy) flows, the IEA said.

The IEA last year stunned the energy industry by saying lower demand and a rise in low emissions fuels made new oil and gas fields beyond 2021 unnecessary in its most climate-friendly net-zero emissions scenario.

On Russia, the IEA said the country, which is the world’s largest fossil fuel exporter, will never regain the share of the global energy supply mix it had before its invasion of Ukraine.

Russia’s supply of internationally traded energy will fall to 13 per cent by 2030 from about 20 per cent in 2021, the IEA projects.

The IEA also said global demand for every type of fossil fuel is set for a peak or plateau for the first time in the agency’s history of modelling.

Global emissions of fossil fuels leading to climate change will peak by 2025, as coal use falls within the next several years, natural gas demand plateaus by 2030, and oil demand levels off in the middle of the next decade before falling.

“One of the effects of Russia’s actions is that the era of rapid growth in natural gas demand draws to a close,” the IEA said, pointing to a rise in global demand for gas of less than 5 per cent between last year and 2030.

Australian environmental group Market Forces picked up on the IEA report saying it undermined the case for energy giants Woodside and Santos’ gas field expansion plans.

“There is no room in the IEA’s net zero by 2050 scenario for gargantuan new projects such as Scarborough-Pluto and Barossa,” the group’s executive director Julien Vincent said in a statement on Thursday night.

“Investors are becoming increasingly concerned that major oil and gas companies don’t know when to stop wasting capital on new projects that have no place in a decarbonised economy,” she said.

“Australia’s gas exporters need to urgently rethink their business plans for a world committed to reducing reliance on fossil fuels.”

The IEA's annual World Energy Outlook acknowledges the economic hit from reduced supplies of Russian oil, natural gas and coal but is keeping an environmental best case scenario in which no investment in new fossil fuel projects is needed.

The outlook prompted different takes from Australian oil and gas field developers and fossil fuel opponents.

The IEA's report said the global energy crisis is causing profound and long-lasting changes that could hasten the transition to a more sustainable and secure energy system.

""Energy markets and policies have changed as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, not just for the time being, but for decades to come,"" said IEA executive director Fatih Birol on Thursday.

""Government responses around the world promise to make this a historic and definitive turning point towards a cleaner, more affordable and more secure energy system"", Birol added.

Short-term gaps created by the reduction in fossil fuel supplies from Russia will need to be plugged from elsewhere.

""In every scenario outlined by the IEA, natural gas has a critical role to play in Asia through coal-to-gas switching, carbon capture, use and storage, hydrogen production, supporting renewables, and the rise of low-carbon gases.

SHANGHAI, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Rich countries must move on from ""empty slogans"" when it comes to climate change and make progress in meeting funding commitments, a Chinese official said on Thursday ahead of a new round of global climate talks in Egypt next month.

""It is important to put forward targets, but it is equally important, even more important, to turn targets into actions,"" said Li Gao, head of the climate change office at China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment.

The latest round of global climate talks are set to begin in Egypt's Sharm el-Sheik on Nov. 6, and Li told a media briefing in Beijing that countries need to show ""real ambition"" at the meeting, known as COP27.

Rich countries pledged in 2009 to provide $100 billion a year by 2020 to help developing countries adapt to climate change, and Li said the delay in doing so has ""seriously hindered"" progress and damaged ""mutual trust"".

""We urge developed countries to fulfil their annual funding commitments of $100 billion as soon as possible, instead of merely submitting a report to COP27 making excuses for the delay,"" he said.

Last year, China pledged to bring greenhouse gas emissions to a peak by 2030 and to become ""carbon neutral"" by 2060, but it has been criticised for not acting faster to cut coal consumption, which is still rising.

Experts say Beijing is unlikely to make fresh pledges ahead of this year's round of talks, especially amid diplomatic tensions with the United States over Taiwan and other issues.

Li urged countries to stop politicizing climate change, warning that the suppression of China's solar panel industry was hurting the global switch to clean energy.

The United States has banned imports of solar products with links to the northwestern Chinese region of Xinjiang, a major producer of polysilicon, a key solar component. China has been accused of using forced labour in Xinjiang, which it vehemently denies.

Li also described European plans to impose carbon tariffs on exports from China and elsewhere as ""morally untenable"".

""We oppose any form of trade or technological barrier established in the name of climate change,"" he said.

Emperor penguins can stand up to four feet tall and are famed for their extreme parenting methods, with pairs of males and females taking turns to shelter their eggs in brutally cold conditions while the other forages for food. While the penguins have an almost comically ambling gait on land, they are skilled operators on the sea ice and water where they hunt for fish and crustaceans. The waters around and beneath the sea ice are important to the penguins as an area for feeding and the ice itself is essential as a place for the animals to rest, to shelter during their annual molt and to escape from predators. But the loss of sea ice, due to global heating, threatens the habitat of these penguins, while ocean acidification is diminishing the supply of krill, a key food source.

Emperor penguins are facing an existential threat from the climate crisis and deserve additional protections under the law, the US federal government ruled this week.

The bird — the largest of all the penguin species — has been listed as “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act, the country’s premier wildlife conservation law.

The primary concern is the melting of their sea ice homes around Antarctica as the planet heats up, the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) said, citing studies that forecast potentially drastic population declines in the coming decades.

This action will provide additional protections for the penguins and help galvanise conservation efforts.

“Climate change is having a profound impact on species around the world and addressing it is a priority for the Administration,” USFWS Director Martha Williams said in a statement. “The listing of the emperor penguin serves as an alarm bell but also a call to action.”

Emperor penguins are perhaps the most famous of the penguin family, having gained international notoriety from films like the documentary March of the Penguins and the animated feature Happy Feet.

UWFWS notes that while the emperor penguin population isn’t declining yet, it’s likely to drop at least 26 per cent by 2050 — or more, if future carbon emissions are higher. This will likely affect some populations, like those in the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific, more than populations in the Ross and Weddell seas, the agency adds.

“This is a big win for these beloved, iconic penguins and all of us who want them to thrive,” Shaye Wolf from the non-profit Center for Biological Diversity, which had sued to get USFWS to consider listing the species, said in a statement. “At the same time, this decision is a warning that emperor penguins need urgent climate action if they’re going to survive.”

Emperor penguins rely heavily on sea ice along the Antarctic coast, including breeding along the sea ice during winter. As the planet heats up, less and less sea ice may form, putting the future of the birds in serious jeopardy.

“Emperor penguins, like many species on Earth, face a very uncertain future, which is dependent on people working together to reduce carbon pollution,” Stephanie Jenouvrier, an ecologist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, said in the centre’s statement.

This decision to list the birds under the Endangered Species Act finalizes a rule first proposed last year. The new status could spur action and funding for conservation, and will require the US government to address any threats to the species via federal agencies, the statement adds.

A 2021 study co-authored by Dr Jenouvrier found that if greenhouse gas emissions continue at a rapid pace over the coming decades, emperor penguins could be pushed toward extinction by the end of the century.

Even under scenarios where carbon emissions decline somewhat, the penguins’ populations are likely to drop over the coming decades, the study added.

A separate study co-authored by Dr Jenouvrier in 2019 found that if the world’s countries were to meet the goals set out by the Paris Agreement and limit warming to around 1.5 – 2 degrees Celsius, emperor penguins could likely avoid total collapse this century.

The world is currently on track to reach about 2.7C of warming by the end of the century, according to the Climate Action Tracker, an independent analysis of global climate policy.

Emperor penguins have been officially declared a threatened species due to the impact of climate change on their habitat.

The adorable flightless birds, which live in Antarctica, were listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on Tuesday. The listing aims to prevent the emperor penguins from reaching extinction.

The impact of climate change on their sea-ice habitat is the “primary threat” to the emperor penguins, according to the agency.

“This listing reflects the growing extinction crisis and highlights the importance of the ESA and efforts to conserve species before population declines become irreversible,” service director Martha Williams said in a statement. “Climate change is having a profound impact on species around the world and addressing it is a priority for the Administration. The listing of the emperor penguin serves as an alarm bell but also a call to action.”

Currently, the Fish and Wildlife Service said emperor penguin populations remain stable with about 61 breeding colonies existing along the coastline of Antarctica with an estimated 625,000 to 650,000 emperor penguins in the world. But experts have predicted their population size could decrease by anywhere from 26% to 47% by 2050.

Climate change is especially threatening to emperor penguins who live in the Indian Ocean, Western Pacific Ocean, Bellingshausen Sea and Amundsen Sea. There, colonies are projected to decline by more than 90% due to melting sea ice, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service.

Last year, the Fish and Wildlife Service declared 23 species extinct, including the Ivory-billed woodpecker, which was America's largest woodpecker and had been listed as endangered since 1967. Since the Endangered Species Act was signed into law in 1973, more than 50 species have been removed from the list due to species recovery and over 50 more have been moved from ""endangered"" to ""threatened.""

Emperor penguins primarily found in the Ross and Weddell Seas in Antarctica, but a few exist in captivity. Visitors to SeaWorld San Diego, for example, can catch a glimpse of these majestic animals along with smaller penguin species: king, adelie, gentoo, chinstrap, and macaroni penguins. The emperor is the largest of all penguin species and stands nearly four feet tall.

889b7d10-d0fa-418e-9d13-439591e7bc58,"Emperor penguins have been listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act because the animals' sea ice habitat is shrinking, federal officials announced Tuesday. Experts predict that 99% of the world's emperor penguin population will disappear by 2100 without significant reductions in carbon pollution.

The Antarctic sea ice, where the penguins spend much of the year, is under distress. Heat-trapping gases released by humans' use of fossil fuels are causing the ice to disappear and break apart. That ice is essential to the animals' livelihood -- it is where they breed, raise their chicks and escape predators.

The seabirds are used to enduring tough times.

Males spend two months incubating their egg on their feet while females feed on krill and squid in the sea. After the egg hatches, the parents take turns waddling dozens of miles to and from the ocean to feed their hungry chick.

That journey -- documented in the 2005 film ""March of the Penguins"" as well as in the 2006 animated movie ""Happy Feet"" -- turned the hardy, flightless seabird into an animal icon of resilience.

According to the U.S. Geological Survey, ""endangered"" means a species could face extinction throughout all or a large portion of its range. ""Threatened"" means a species is likely to become endangered in the near future.

U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director Martha Williams said in a statement the listing reflected the ""growing extinction crisis.""

""Climate change is having a profound impact on species around the world and addressing it is a priority for the Administration,"" Williams said. ""The listing of the emperor penguin serves as an alarm bell but also a call to action.""

The designation, which comes more than a year after the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced a proposal to protect the penguins, places the animals among a couple dozen species that the federal government considers threatened by climate change, including polar bears, two kinds of seals and 20 varieties of coral.

""That body of science really helped to make this decision really clear,"" said Shaye Wolf, the Center for Biological Diversity's climate science director. ""That the penguin is endangered by climate change and needs all the protection it can get.""

Right now, the penguin's population appears stable, with between 625,000 and 650,000 birds shuffling and sliding around Antarctica. But there are already signs of what the future may hold for the bird.

The breakup of sea ice before chicks were ready to swim at Halley Bay and Cape Crozier led to breeding failures in recent years.

The Endangered Species Act is the world's strongest environmental law that is intended to prevent extinction and foster the recovery of at-risk species, according to a news release from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, a research facility in Massachusetts.

A listing under the act encourages international cooperation on conservation strategies. Although the species is not found within the United States, federal agencies must now ensure that their projects that emit large amounts of carbon pollution do not threaten the penguin or its environment.

""Emperor penguins, like many species on earth, face a very uncertain future, which is dependent on people working together to reduce carbon pollution,"" Stephanie Jenouvrier, an associate scientist and seabird ecologist at Woods Hole, said in the news release. ""We should draw inspiration from the penguins themselves; only together can penguins brave the harshest climate on earth, and only together can we face a difficult climate future.""

It has been more than a decade since the Center for Biological Diversity petitioned the Fish and Wildlife Service to protect the emperor penguin under the Endangered Species Act, the news release said.

In 2014, the agency agreed that the animal may be endangered because of climate change but did not take action. Five years later, the center sued the Trump administration for failing to act on the petition.

There are 18 different species of penguins and the emperor penguin is the tallest at nearly 4 feet. It and the Adelie, a medium-size penguin with a white ring around the eyes, are the only penguins native to Antarctica.

Emperor penguins are an integral part of the Antarctic food chain, in which they prey upon squid and small fish and are preyed upon by larger predators like the leopard seal and killer whale.

Caring for their young is a task that involves both parents.

After laying a single egg, females hunt while males hold it on their feet, covering it in a feathered pouch. After the egg hatches, the parents alternate caring for the chick.

Young penguins that do not develop their adult feathers before the sea ice disappears cannot swim in the freezing waters and will die.

Emperor penguins do not fare well on land. They can't climb icy cliffs and are vulnerable to warming weather and high winds.

In 2016, the Antarctic's second-largest colony of the birds lost more than 10,000 chicks after a period of heavy winds and record-low sea ice before the chicks had grown their feathers.

There are as many as 650,000 emperor penguins now in Antarctica. That could shrink by 26% to 47% by 2050, according to estimates cited by wildlife officials. A study last year predicted that, under current trends, nearly all emperor penguin colonies would become ""quasi-extinct"" by 2100.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists the penguins as ""near threatened"" on its Red List of Threatened Species.

As sea ice disappears because of climate change, the penguins lose needed space to breed and raise chicks and to avoid predators. Their key food source, krill, is also declining because of melting ice, ocean acidification and industrial fishing, according to the Center for Biological Diversity.

The organization first petitioned the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to make the endangered species designation for emperor penguins in 2011. The center's climate science director, Shaye Wolf, said the decision ""is a warning that emperor penguins need urgent climate action if they're going to survive. The penguin's very existence depends on whether our government takes strong action now to cut climate-heating fossil fuels and prevent irreversible damage to life on Earth.""

Though emperor penguins are not found naturally in the U.S., the endangered species protections will help increase funding for conservation efforts. U.S. agencies will also now be required to evaluate how fisheries and greenhouse gas-emitting projects will affect the population, according to the Center for Biological Diversity.

The rule will take effect next month.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has officially designated Antarctica's emperor penguins as a ""threatened"" species, saying climate change has had a ""profound impact"" on the birds.

As many as 650,000 emperor penguins are living in Antarctica, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reported last year, and experts think that number could shrink by 26% to 47% by 2050.

The wildlife agency first floated the idea of protecting the penguins in 2021, issuing a statement citing melting sea ice as the prime culprit for the species' diminishing numbers.

""The estimated decrease in population size is not equal across Antarctica,"" the agency shared in 2021. ""The Ross and Weddell Seas are strongholds for the species, and populations in these areas will most likely remain stable. However, emperor penguin colonies within the Indian Ocean, Western Pacific Ocean, and Bellingshausen Sea and Amundsen Sea sectors are projected to decline by over 90 percent due to melting sea ice.""

It concluded, ""While this estimated decline is concerning, the proposal to list the emperor penguin as threatened under the ESA comes while there is still time to prevent the species from becoming endangered throughout a significant portion of its range.""

With the Emperor penguin's new Endangered Species Act protection, conservationists now hope that U.S. officials will begin to limit krill fishing around the continent and weigh the climate implications of federal projects before approving them, the Post reported.

""If we manage to take action, and especially action now,"" scientist Stephanie Jenouvrier told the outlet, ""we can still avoid the extinction."""

In its announcement Tuesday, the USFWS said that while the emperor penguin population is stable for the moment, projected loss of Antarctic sea ice is likely to have major impacts on population size by midcentury. The species currently has about 61 breeding colonies along the coast of the continent and between 625,000 and 650,000 individual penguins among the entire species population.

However, projections of carbon emissions and their impact on sea ice found that by 2050, the population could recede by between 26 percent in a low-emissions scenario and 47 percent in a high-emissions scenario. A worst-case scenario could reduce the global population size to just over 132,000 breeding pairs, according to the USFWS.

Certain regions would be harder hit than others, according to USFWS projections, with melting sea ice potentially reducing populations by more than 90 percent in colonies within the Indian Ocean and western Pacific as well as the Bellingshausen and Amundsen seas.

It’s a sad day for penguin lovers: the emperor penguin has been declared a threatened species by the U.S. government due to the effects of climate change on the penguin’s natural sea ice habitat.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service finalized legal protection for the flightless bird on Tuesday under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The government body claimed the rapid loss of the emperor penguin’s habitat in Antarctica is the “primary threat” to the world’s tallest, heaviest penguin.

“Climate change is having a profound impact on species around the world and addressing it is a priority for the Administration. The listing of the emperor penguin serves as an alarm bell but also a call to action,” said U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service director Martha Williams.

The government body claimed rising carbon dioxide emissions have and will continue to raise global temperatures, causing sea ice to break and melt. The Antarctic ice is vital to the emperor penguin species for habitat, food, breeding and protection from predators.

The addition of the emperor penguin to the threatened species list is mostly preventative, as penguin populations currently appear to be stable — but if global temperatures continue to rise as a result of climate change, the species will be in danger of extinction.

Already, climate change has had a great impact on certain colonies of emperor penguins (as threats vary in severity across the 61 different breeding colonies along the Antarctic coast).

In 2016, after a year of severe weather, the second-largest emperor penguin colony in Halley Bay experienced a devastating loss when thousands of chicks drowned after sea ice broke up early. The chicks were too young to swim properly. The colony has not recovered, and many penguins have since relocated or failed in their breeding entirely.

The U.S. wildlife service claimed emperor penguin colonies surrounding the Indian Ocean, Western Pacific Ocean, Bellingshausen Sea and Amundsen Sea are projected to experience a population decline of over 90 per cent due to melting sea ice.

The government body hopes the emperor penguin’s new label as a threatened species will allow time to prevent extinction of the globally beloved birds. International conservation measures are expected to be put in place as a result of the declaration, better protecting the Antarctic habitat through reduced industrial fishing and restricted American greenhouse gas emissions.

The emperor penguin is not the only species facing troublesome news this week. The North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium issued a statement Monday claiming the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale population is still struggling to survive and reproduce. There are believed to be only 340 right whales currently living — a shockingly low number, considering less than 100 of those individuals are breeding females.

The 1973 Endangered Species Act is credited with bringing several animals back from the brink of extinction, including grizzly bears, bald eagles, gray whales and others. The law has frustrated drilling and mining industries, among others, which can be stopped from developing areas deemed necessary for species survival.

c1b48f4c-e2c3-4ab2-9f44-ddf54319fa93,"One of the most famous Antarctic species could be battling extinction in the next century, wildlife officials say, as the emperor penguin was given the threatened species status under the Endangered Species Act by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Tuesday, with climate change listed as a primary cause.

The largest penguin species in the world, the white bellied, orange-marked flightless birds inhabit much of Antarctica, with 61 known breeding colonies in the continent, according to the service.

Even though the emperor penguin population has remained relatively stable, with an estimated 625,000-650,000 birds around today, wildlife officials say a significant portion of the species' population ""is in danger of extinction in the foreseeable future.""

Citing the ESA, wildlife officials say the emperor penguin is threatened because its habitat and range are facing possible destruction, as well as natural and manmade factors affecting its existence. The birds would become an endangered species if its habitat or range is under immediate danger.

U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimates by 2050, the global population of emperor penguins could decrease by 26%-47%, depending on how emissions levels and climate change progress.

By 2100, the service has ""substantial uncertainty"" regarding the species' population. The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, a research group that has studied the species, estimates that 99% of the population could be gone by then.

'An alarm bell but also a call to action'

Loss of sea ice is at the forefront of climate change's potential impact on penguin populations. Each winter, frozen seawater floats on the ocean's surface before retreating in the summer, according to NASA. During those winter months, with sea ice at a premium, emperor penguins form breeding colonies, search for food and use it to avoid becoming prey to killer whales and leopard seals.

But the rise of carbon dioxide emissions means Earth's temperature is rising, the service says, meaning there could be reduction of sea ice. The ice also plays a crucial role for penguin chicks. Newborns are typically born in the late summer, but with less sea ice, they could be susceptible to death in the freezing waters without having the time to grow adult feathers.

""This listing reflects the growing extinction crisis and highlights the importance of the ESA and efforts to conserve species before population declines become irreversible,"" service director Martha Williams said in a statement. ""Climate change is having a profound impact on species around the world and addressing it is a priority for the Administration. The listing of the emperor penguin serves as an alarm bell but also a call to action.""

'Devastating': World is 'heading in the wrong direction' on climate change, new UN report warns

The ruling comes as several organizations have longed asked for the species to have protections. In 2011, the Center for Biological Diversity petitioned to the wildlife service for them to be put under the ESA. The agency agreed about the potential danger to the population in 2014, but did not make any efforts to propose protections, and in 2019, the Center for Biological Diversity sued the Trump Administration for failing to act on it.

With emperor penguins protected under the ESA, federal agencies are now required to reduce threats to the population, such as reducing the fishing of primary penguin food like krill and squid. Dubbed ""the world’s strongest environmental law focused on preventing extinction and facilitating recovery of imperiled species"" by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, the ruling also promotes international conservation strategies and research on how to stabilize the population.

""Listing emperor penguins as a threatened species is an important step for raising awareness about the impact of climate change,"" Stephanie Jenouvrier, seabird ecologist at the institute who has studied the emperor penguin population, said in a statement. ""Emperor penguins, like many species on earth, face a very uncertain future, which is dependent on people working together to reduce carbon pollution.""

The final ruling on the emperor penguin's threatened status will be published on Oct. 26, and will go into effect 30 days later.

Today, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) announced that emperor penguins have been listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) based on evidence that the animal's sea ice habitat is shrinking and is likely to continue to do so over the next several decades. This listing comes more than one year after a USFWS proposal to list the species, and confirms that the animal is at risk of becoming an endangered species—in danger of extinction—in the foreseeable future if its habitat continues to be destroyed or adversely changed.

The Endangered Species Act is the world's strongest environmental law focused on preventing extinction and facilitating recovery of imperiled species. The ESA has increasingly been applied to provide protection for species threatened primarily or in part by climate change, with the polar bear being the first species listed principally due to global warming (2008). For threatened species, listing under the ESA mandates use of science-based, enforceable tools to reduce climate threats and increase resilience. Changing weather and climate are affecting the extent and duration of sea ice around Antarctica with consequences for the food web, key thresholds for naming the emperor penguins to the ESL.

An Endangered Species Act listing for the emperor penguin promotes international cooperation on conservation strategies, increases funding for conservation programs, spurs research and provides concrete tools for threat reductions. Federal agencies are now required to reduce threats to emperor penguins, including ensuring that federal projects that emit large volumes of carbon pollution do not jeopardize the penguin or its habitat and that industrial fisheries don't deplete the bird's key prey species.

Decades of studies by an international team of penguin researchers, including Stephanie Jenouvrier, associate scientist and seabird ecologist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), have been instrumental in establishing the need for protections and highlighting that urgent climate action is needed to protect the species. Emperor penguins are an indicator species whose population trends can illustrate the consequences of climate changes. These iconic birds need reliable sea ice for breeding and raising their chicks and are being pushed toward extinction by the climate crisis melting the sea ice they need for survival and reproduction. With sea ice disappearing or breaking up earlier in the year, entire emperor penguin colonies are declining or vanishing in parts of Antarctica.

""Listing emperor penguins as a threatened species is an important step for raising awareness about the impact of climate change,"" said Jenouvrier. ""Emperor penguins, like many species on earth, face a very uncertain future, which is dependent on people working together to reduce carbon pollution. We should draw inspiration from the penguins themselves; only together can penguins brave the harshest climate on Earth, and only together can we face a difficult climate future.""

Research from penguin scientists is key to informing policy around much-needed protections for the emperor penguin. The ESA listing was rooted in foundational research and findings that scientists provided USFWS, including a study published last year in Global Change Biology, and an earlier study in Global Change Biology (November 2019), recommending that emperor penguins be listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Another pivotal study in Biological Conservation (January 2020) highlights the need to improve the forecasting of ecological responses to climate change as it specifically relates to the effective management of the emperor penguin.

The Center for Biological Diversity has long fought for Endangered Species Act protection for the emperor penguin. In 2011 the Center petitioned the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to protect the emperor penguin under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. In 2014 the agency agreed that the emperor penguin may be endangered by climate change but failed to make the required 12-month finding on whether to propose protection. In July 2019, the Center sued the Trump administration for failing to act on the petition to protect emperor penguins under the Act.

""This is a big win for these beloved, iconic penguins and all of us who want them to thrive,"" said Shaye Wolf, Ph.D., the Center's climate science director. ""At the same time, this decision is a warning that emperor penguins need urgent climate action if they're going to survive. The penguin's very existence depends on whether our government takes strong action now to cut climate-heating fossil fuels and prevent irreversible damage to life on Earth.""

Scientists have been working for decades to develop technologies that can remotely sense emperor penguins and ecosystem health. Daniel Zitterbart is an associate scientist at WHOI who studies penguin colonies around Antarctica and sub-Antarctic Islands. He and his colleagues use remote sensing of animal group behavior to understand more about ocean and ecosystem health, and this technology will benefit future monitoring programs to measure the conservation impact. His research takes him to Antarctica, often for months at a time, to live and work among emperor penguin colonies.

""Emperor penguins are a sentinel species that highlight the vulnerability of ice-dependent species in a rapidly warming world,"" said Zitterbart. ""Although they live far from human activity, the far-reaching effects of climate change present the most substantial threat facing the species' survival.""

Emperor penguins—the world's largest penguin species—breed and molt on sea ice (frozen seawater). Of the 18 different species of penguins, only two (the emperor and Adélie) are true Antarctic residents. Emperor penguins are extremely vulnerable to a warming climate, because like polar bears in the Arctic, depend on sea ice for vital life activities like breeding, feeding, and molting. They are well adapted to thrive in freezing conditions, but in parts of the Antarctic Peninsula, sea ice cover has reduced by over 60% in 30 years and one colony has virtually disappeared. Emperor penguins are a vital part of the Antarctic food chain—they prey upon krill, squid, and small fish and in turn are preyed upon by predators like leopard seals and killer whales.

""The U.S. Government is today ringing alarm bells to the world with its decision to list the emperor penguin as Threatened, under the US Endangered Species Act,"" said Philip Trathan, Emeritus Fellow (retired) at the British Antarctic Survey. ""International action is now urgently needed through the Antarctic Treaty System to protect this species, while globally governments work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Only global reductions in greenhouse gas emissions will secure the future for these iconic ice-dependent species.""

Scientist project that 99% of the world's emperor penguins will disappear by 2100 without major cuts in carbon pollution. ""The world needs to take aggressive actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions now, and the Paris Climate Agreement objectives must be met, to help prevent further population declines,"" said WHOI's Jenouvrier."

New York (Reuters) - Antarctica’s emperor penguin is at risk of extinction due to rising global temperatures and sea ice loss, the U.S. government said Tuesday as it finalized protections for the animal under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said emperor penguins should be protected under the law since the birds build colonies and raise their young on the Antarctic ice threatened by climate change.

The wildlife agency said a thorough review of evidence, including satellite data from 40 years showed the penguins aren’t currently in danger of extinction, but rising temperatures signal that is likely. The agency's review followed a 2011 petition by the environmental group Center for Biological Diversity to list the bird under the Endangered Species Act.

Climate change has caused colonies to experience breeding failures, according to the government. The Halley Bay colony in the Weddell Sea, the second-largest emperor penguin colony in the world, experienced several years of poor sea ice conditions, leading to the drowning of all newborn chicks beginning in 2016, the government said.

The endangered status will promote international cooperation for conservation strategies, increase funding for conservation programs and require federal agencies in the United States to act to reduce threats.

Tuesday's designation was described as a warning that emperor penguins need “urgent climate action” in order to survive by Shaye Wolf, the climate science director at the Center for Biological Diversity.

“The penguin’s very existence depends on whether our government takes strong action now to cut climate-heating fossil fuels and prevent irreversible damage to life on Earth,” Wolf said.

The 1973 Endangered Species Act is credited with bringing several animals back from the brink of extinction, including grizzly bears, bald eagles, gray whales and others. The law has frustrated some drilling and mining industries among others, which can be stopped from developing areas deemed necessary for species survival.

Emperor penguins have been officially declared a threatened species due to the impact of climate change on their habitat.

The adorable flightless birds, which live in Antarctica, were listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on Tuesday. The listing aims to prevent the emperor penguins from reaching extinction.

The impact of climate change on their sea-ice habitat is the “primary threat” to the emperor penguins, according to the agency.

“This listing reflects the growing extinction crisis and highlights the importance of the ESA and efforts to conserve species before population declines become irreversible,” service director Martha Williams said in a statement. “Climate change is having a profound impact on species around the world and addressing it is a priority for the Administration. The listing of the emperor penguin serves as an alarm bell but also a call to action.”

Currently, the Fish and Wildlife Service said emperor penguin populations remain stable with about 61 breeding colonies existing along the coastline of Antarctica with an estimated 625,000 to 650,000 emperor penguins in the world. But experts have predicted their population size could decrease by anywhere from 26% to 47% by 2050.

Climate change is especially threatening to emperor penguins who live in the Indian Ocean, Western Pacific Ocean, Bellingshausen Sea and Amundsen Sea. There, colonies are projected to decline by more than 90% due to melting sea ice, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service.

Last year, the Fish and Wildlife Service declared 23 species extinct, including the Ivory-billed woodpecker, which was America's largest woodpecker and had been listed as endangered since 1967. Since the Endangered Species Act was signed into law in 1973, more than 50 species have been removed from the list due to species recovery and over 50 more have been moved from ""endangered"" to ""threatened.""

Emperor penguins primarily found in the Ross and Weddell Seas in Antarctica, but a few exist in captivity. Visitors to SeaWorld San Diego, for example, can catch a glimpse of these majestic animals along with smaller penguin species: king, adelie, gentoo, chinstrap, and macaroni penguins. The emperor is the largest of all penguin species and stands nearly four feet tall.

In its announcement Tuesday, the USFWS said that while the emperor penguin population is stable for the moment, projected loss of Antarctic sea ice is likely to have major impacts on population size by midcentury. The species currently has about 61 breeding colonies along the coast of the continent and between 625,000 and 650,000 individual penguins among the entire species population.

However, projections of carbon emissions and their impact on sea ice found that by 2050, the population could recede by between 26 percent in a low-emissions scenario and 47 percent in a high-emissions scenario. A worst-case scenario could reduce the global population size to just over 132,000 breeding pairs, according to the USFWS.

Certain regions would be harder hit than others, according to USFWS projections, with melting sea ice potentially reducing populations by more than 90 percent in colonies within the Indian Ocean and western Pacific as well as the Bellingshausen and Amundsen seas.

The USFWS is set to publish the final rule assigning the threatened classification on Wednesday. It will take effect 30 days later.

BRIG, Switzerland (AP) — A battle is brewing around Europe's rooftop over the planet's most precious resource.

The crystal-clear waters issuing from the Alps could become increasingly contested as the effects of climate change and glacier melt become more apparent. Italy wants them for crop irrigation in the spring and summer. Swiss authorities want to hold up flows to help hydroelectric plants rev up, when needed.

For the first time in four years, government envoys from eight Alpine countries — big, small and tiny — were meeting under a grouping known as the Alpine Convention, which was set up 30 years ago to help coordinate life, leisure and the limited resources from Europe's most celebrated peaks.

The envoys in Brig, Switzerland, representing pint-sized principality Monaco and small Slovenia as well as powerhouses like France, Germany and Italy, focused attention Thursday on what's known as the Simplon Alliance. Named after an Alpine pass between Italy and Switzerland, it aims to make transportation in the mountains more eco-friendly, such as by favoring rail over roads, electric vehicles and public transportation over private cars.

But with global warming causing a worrying shrinkage in Alpine glaciers this year, the issue of water frozen up in the mountains, or showered and snowed on them, is growing in importance. Environmental advocates say jockeying for water isn't being addressed with enough urgency; they want the Alpine countries to do more to secure the future of the resource that's been bountiful for centuries.

While many parts of the world have grappled with water woes, well-irrigated and relatively rich Europe has been largely spared so far. Droughts and wildfires raise seasonal worries, but there typically is enough water for agriculture, hydropower, ski resorts, and human consumption. Swiss children were once taught their country was home to the continent's “water tower,” according to Maria Lezzi, head of Switzerland's territorial development office.

However, factors like global warming, the fallout from Russia's war in Ukraine on energy supplies and economic demands have made the issue more pressing.

Last month, Swiss authorities authorized a seven-month increase in the amount of water available for electricity generation from 45 of Switzerland’s 1,500 hydraulic plants — hoping to churn out up to 150 gigawatts more power. Alluding to the possible knock-on effect, the Swiss said the move could temporarily affect fish migration, ""which could make replenishing fish populations more difficult in 2023.”

Meanwhile, sparse summer rainfall and a punishing heat wave in northern Italy — which melted snowfields and glaciers in the area — dried up the Po River, jeopardized drinking water and threatened irrigation in what’s known as the Italian food valley.

The “9th report on the State of the Alps” — drafted by the Swiss hosts — notes that water supply is a “particularly pressing issue"" because the Alps are a huge reservoir of water, which ultimately flows to the benefit of some 170 million people along some of Europe's most famous rivers, including the Danube, Po, Rhine and Rhone.

A draft of the report, obtained by The Associated Press, noted the need for “consistent availability of Alpine water"" for industry, agriculture, hydropower and other uses, adding: "" “Climate change puts these functions under pressure, as glaciers are receding and precipitation regimes are constantly changing.”

“Reduced quantities of water and limited reliability of water supply will be a major issue in the coming decades,” it added.

Kaspar Schuler, director of CIPRA International, a commission devoted to protecting the Alps based in tiny Liechtenstein, said governments have done well to put water on the agenda but stopped short of steps to tackle the issue — by setting up working groups, expanding research, or coming up with ways that water can be better shared in the future.

“The description of the difficulties is well done by the Swiss, but they have still no courage to really address the elephant in the room,” said Schuler added.

While Alpine resorts and villages rely on water, the major upstream users are Switzerland's hydropower plants, which want to hold onto the water until it's most needed to power turbines that provide some 60% of the country's electricity.

But the biggest consumers of the water are downstream — industrial areas like Grenoble and Annecy in France, Austria's capital Vienna, and areas around Bolzano in Italy's South Tyrol are likely to feel an impact.

The southern Alpine towns, especially in France and Italy with their drier climates, are more likely to undergo water shortages than the northern towns, the report said. “This is particularly true of inner-Alpine dry valleys such as the Aosta Valley in northwestern Italy, already affected by significant water stress.”

CIPRA's Schuler suggested that many have become too complacent about the Alps' bountiful waters — and those days may be over soon.

“Until now, all the non-Alpine countries — the lowlands — were happy that the Alps have been providing so much: landscape for leisure and sports, ski resorts, and the water as much as everybody needs,"" he said. ""So far, everybody was happy and the Alps delivered.""

""In future it will be a battle ... about these resources because especially the lack of water can really harm a lot of people,” he said.(backslash)

Environment Minister Uros Brezan of Slovenia, which is set to take over the Alpine Convention's presidency, said regional authorities were not taking the issue lightly.

“I think the member states of the European Union and also members of the Alpine Convention are well aware that water scarcity problem cannot be solved only within the national borders, but has to be addressed internationally,” he said.

823afced-a2dc-4413-9b59-8184209e0c1c,"‘Climate change is severely impacting people’s health around the world’, says the BBC, citing a new report by the Lancet. By the BBC’s telling, extreme weather is ‘exacerbating conditions such as cardiovascular and respiratory disease, and causing heat stroke and poor mental health’. Worse still, climate change has even ‘increased the spread of infectious diseases’ like malaria. The report and the BBC’s coverage leave no doubt about what they think should be done to stop this dire ‘threat to global health’. Apparently, we need to stop using fossil fuels as soon as possible.

Published yesterday, the Lancet report is dramatically titled ‘Health at the Mercy of Fossil Fuels’. The BBC’s climate editor, Justin Rowlatt, has hailed it as a ‘call to arms’, showing the need for ‘urgent action’ on climate. However, there are good reasons to be sceptical. For one thing, it is not remotely clear that human health is getting worse overall, regardless of climate change. Worldwide, humans today are living far longer, healthier and wealthier lives than our ancestors. Since the industrial revolution, and especially in the second half of the 20th century, the technological and economic benefits of rising living standards have taken billions out of poverty worldwide. Indeed, so much so that in 2010, the world met an ambitious UN development goal of reducing global poverty by half, five years ahead of schedule.

All this economic growth has dramatically increased global life expectancy. This should not be surprising: stronger economies have better healthcare services, better sanitation and improved nutrition. This is not to say that everything is perfect, but it certainly isn’t all doom and gloom. Better still, none of this progress has been stalled or eroded by climate change as the alarmists would have us believe. The great irony of the Lancet report is that it unwittingly makes a persuasive case that economic development is the key to improving global health. What the Lancet neglects to mention is that, barring a major unforseen technological breakthrough, this economic development is overwhelmingly dependent on fossil fuels and will be for decades to come.

‘Health systems worldwide are debilitated by… the energy and cost-of-living crises’, the Lancet finds. High energy prices often make it too costly for hospitals to function properly. The extent of the problem, the report shows, is stark: ‘An estimated 59 per cent of healthcare facilities in low- and middle-income countries still do not have access to the reliable electricity needed to provide basic care.’ Furthermore, in the developing world, ‘millions of people do not have access to the energy needed to keep their homes at healthy temperatures [or to] preserve food and medication’. The report notes that the impacts of heat exposure and extreme weather events ‘particularly [burden] people in low HDI (Human Development Index) countries’. The Lancet is quite right: rich countries are far more resilient to the effects of extreme weather. And poverty poses particular challenges to health systems in poor countries.

The fact that economic growth makes the world safer, as the Lancet acknowledges, entirely undercuts its warnings about the climate. Eager to tout the many dangers of a warming world, climate alarmists – including at the BBC – forget that thanks to economic growth, total numbers of climate-related deaths have actually fallen 20-fold in the past century. This is despite the massive global population increase in that time, meaning the actual risk to an individual of succumbing to a climate-related death has fallen by 99 per cent. Another major threat to global health comes from dirty fuels. The Lancet reports that 96 per cent of ‘domestic sector’ energy consumption in low HDI countries comes from biomass, a huge cause of respiratory disease. As the World Health Organisation reports, about 2.4 billion people worldwide cook with biomass, using open fires or inefficient stoves, generating harmful household air pollution. This pollution was responsible for an estimated 3.2million deaths in 2020, including the deaths of 237,000 children under the age of five.

Whether it is produced by gas, coal, nuclear or renewables, the solution to this problem is electricity. Generating energy elsewhere saves households from having to directly inhale smoke. For the developing world, fossil fuels are by far the most viable way of doing this. There is an iron-clad relationship between economic development and people’s health. And no country in history has ever become wealthy without making use of fossil fuels. If anything is likely to jeopardise the past century of progress, it is not climate change, but extreme climate policy. A programme of eco-austerity, where vital energy sources are kept in the ground, really could put the brakes on development. Climate alarmism is the real threat to health here."

Extreme heat was a factor in tens of millions of people reporting moderate to severe food insecurity in 2020, adding to the strain of skyrocketing food prices and multiple global crises, a new report has found.

The publication, The 2022 report of the Lancet Countdown on health and climate change: health at the mercy of fossil fuels, was published Tuesday. It explored the impact the world’s continued reliance on fossil fuels is having on global health — and painted a dire picture of the direction the world is headed in.

“Climate change is increasingly undermining global food security, exacerbating the effects of the COVID-19, geopolitical, energy, and cost-of-living crises,” the report found.

Relative to what was reported annually between 1981 and 2010, extreme heat was associated with 98 million more people reporting moderate to severe food insecurity in 2020 in the 103 countries analyzed, according to the report.

That’s because increasingly extreme weather, a reality driven in large part by the world’s changing climate, “worsens the stability of global food systems,” the authors explained.

Extreme heat compounds on a number of other issues that have impacted food security in recent years.

The report found that in 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, 161 million more people faced hunger than in 2019. In 2022, the situation is believed to have “worsened,” with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and affordability issues weighing on people worldwide.

“Impacts on international agricultural production and supply chains (are) threatening to result in 13 million additional people facing undernutrition in 2022,” the report warned.

Part of the problem is the impact that high temperatures have on crop growth. Extreme heat can lead to “fast crop maturation,” which the report said “reduces the maximum potential yield that could be achieved with no limitations of water or nutrients.”

Compared with the average during 1981–2010, the report found that average crop growth season lengths in 2021 have shortened for a number of key staples: the crop growth season for maize is down more than nine days, rice’s growth season is down almost two days, and winter and spring wheat has shaved six days off its growth season.

The release of the report comes as the House of Commons agriculture committee is set to meet Wednesday afternoon to discuss the issue of global food insecurity, where members of Parliament will hear from a number of Canadian agriculture industry stakeholders.

Canadians have felt the impact of soaring food costs first-hand, as grocery prices in September rose at the fastest pace since 1981. Prices were up 11.4 per cent compared with a year ago — compared with an overall inflation rate of 6.9 per cent.

The skyrocketing prices prompted Canada’s competition watchdog to launch a study of the grocery industry to examine whether the highly concentrated sector is contributing to rising food costs.

While climate change is impacting how much people are the world can eat, changing how we eat can actually help to mitigate climate change.

The report found that an “accelerated transition” to “balanced and more plant-based diets” would help reduce 55 per cent of the emissions that come from red meat and milk production, but also prevent “up to 11.5 million diet-related deaths annually” as well as “substantially” reduce the risk of zoonotic diseases.

Heat-related deaths up 68% over last 20 years, new report says

The new report found heat exposure is taking more lives around the world today than it did two decades ago.

Heat-related deaths increased by 68 per cent between 2000-2004 and 2017-2021, the publication warned.

The finding comes as headline-grabbing heatwaves brought scorching temperatures to city streets around the globe in the last two years.

In July, parts of the European Union were hit with a record-breaking heatwave, sparking wildfires in Spain, France and Portugal. Excess mortality in July amounted to roughly 53,000 deaths when compared with the monthly averages for 2016-2019, EU’s statistics office Eurostat said.

In B.C. in the summer of 2021, a boiling heatwave saw at least 719 people die over a one-week stretch — three times more than what would normally have been expected over the same period, according to the province’s coroner’s office.

Taking a health-centred approach to tackling climate change would help to mitigate the most “catastrophic” impacts of global warming, the report argued.

It recommended that governments around the world reduce their dependence on fossil fuels, pointing out that the carbon intensity of the global energy system has decreased “by less than 1 per cent” since the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was established in 1994.

“Simultaneously, the total energy demand has risen by 59 per cent, increasing energy-related emissions to a historical high in 2021,” the report said.

The amount of methane in the atmosphere is racing ahead at an accelerating pace, according to a study by the World Meteorological Organization, threatening to undermine efforts to slow climate change. The WMO’s Greenhouse Gas Bulletin said that “global emissions have rebounded since the COVID-related lockdowns” and that the increases in methane levels in 2020 and 2021 were the largest since systematic record keeping began in 1983.

“Methane concentrations are not just rising, they’re rising faster than ever,” said Rob Jackson, a professor of Earth system science at Stanford University.

The study comes on the same day as a new U.N. report that says the world’s governments haven’t committed to cut enough carbon emissions, putting the world on track for a 2.5 degree Celsius (4.5 degree Fahrenheit) increase in global temperatures by the end of the century.

The analysis said the level of emissions implied by countries’ new commitments was slightly lower than a year ago but would still lead to a full degree of temperature increase beyond the target level set at the most recent climate summits. To avert the most catastrophic consequences of climate change, scientists say, humanity must limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels.

“Government decisions and actions must reflect the level of urgency, the gravity of the threats we are facing, and the shortness of the time we have remaining to avoid the devastating consequences of runaway climate change,” said Simon Stiell, executive secretary of the U.N. Climate Change Secretariat. “We are still nowhere near the scale and pace of emission reductions required.”

Instead, the U.N. report found, the world is barreling toward a future of unbearable heat, escalating weather disasters, collapsing ecosystems and widespread hunger and disease.

“It’s a dismal, horrendous, incomprehensible picture,” Inger Andersen, executive director of the U.N. Environment Program, said of the world’s current warming path. “That picture is just not a picture we can accept.”

The quickest way to affect the pace of global warming would be cutting emissions of methane, the second-largest contributor to climate change. It has a warming impact 80 times greater than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. The WMO said the amount of methane in the atmosphere jumped by 15 parts per billion in 2020 and 18 parts per billion in 2021.

Scientists are studying whether the unusually large increases in atmospheric methane levels in 2020 and 2021 are the result of a “climate feedback” from nature-based sources such as tropical wetlands and rice paddies, or whether they are the result of human-made natural gas and industrial leakage. Or both.

Methane emitted by fossil sources has more of the carbon-13 isotope than that produced from wetlands or cattle.

“The isotope data suggest it’s biological rather than fossil methane from gas leaks. It could be from agriculture,” Jackson said. He warned that “it could even be the start of a dangerous warming-induced acceleration in methane emissions from wetlands and other natural systems we’ve been worrying about for decades.”

The WMO said that as the planet gets warmer, organic material decomposes faster. If the organic material decomposes in water — without oxygen — this leads to methane emissions. This process could feed on itself; if tropical wetlands become wetter and warmer, more emissions are possible.

“Will warming feed warming in tropical wetlands?” Jackson asked. “We don’t know yet.”

Antoine Halff, chief analyst and co-founder of the firm Kayrros, which does extensive analysis of satellite data, said that “we’re not seeing any increase” in methane generated by fossil sources. He said some countries, such as Australia, had cut emissions while others, such as Algeria, had worsened.

Atmospheric levels of the other two main greenhouse gases — carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide — also reached record highs in 2021, the WMO study said: “The increase in carbon dioxide levels from 2020 to 2021 was larger than the average annual growth rate over the last decade.”

Carbon dioxide concentrations in 2021 were 415.7 parts per million (or ppm), methane at 1908 parts per billion (ppb) and nitrous oxide at 334.5 ppb. These values represented 149 percent, 262 percent and 124 percent of preindustrial levels, respectively.

The report “underlined, once again, the enormous challenge — and the vital necessity — of urgent action to cut greenhouse gas emissions and prevent global temperatures rising even further in the future,” WMO Secretary General Petteri Taalas said.

Like others, Taalas has urged the pursuit of inexpensive techniques for capturing the short-lived methane, especially when it comes to natural gas. Because of its relatively short life span, methane’s “impact on climate is reversible,” he said.

“The needed changes are economically affordable and technically possible. Time is running out,” he said.

The WMO also pointed to the warming of oceans and land as well as the atmosphere. “Of the total emissions from human activities during the 2011-2020 period, about 48 percent accumulated in the atmosphere, 26 percent in the ocean and 29 percent on land,” the report said.

The WMO report comes shortly before the COP27 climate conference in Egypt next month. Last year, in the run-up to the climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland, the United States and European Union took the lead in promoting the Global Methane Pledge, which set a goal of reaching a 30 percent reduction in the atmosphere by 2030. They estimated that could shave 0.2 degrees Celsius off the rise in temperatures that would otherwise take place. So far, 122 countries have signed up for the pledge.

White House climate negotiator John F. Kerry said that in the U.S.-China joint declaration issued in Glasgow, China vowed to release “an ambitious plan” for this year’s climate summit that would move to cut its methane pollution. So far, however, that has not happened and China still has not issued an up-to-date “nationally determined contribution,” or NDC, in the lingo of the United Nations.

“We look forward to an updated 2030 NDC from China that accelerates CO2 reductions and addresses all greenhouse gases,” Kerry said.

“To keep this goal alive, national governments need to strengthen their climate action plans now and implement them in the next eight years,” he said.

Yet the United States is also among the vast majority of nations that have not updated their NDCs this year, something that all countries promised to do when the Glasgow summit ended one year ago.

Just 24 countries have submitted new pledges in the past 12 months — and few of the updated commitments represent a meaningful improvement over their past promises, the U.N. report found. Australia made the most significant changes in its national climate goal, which previously hadn’t been updated since the Paris agreement was signed in 2015.

Altogether, the combined 193 climate pledges made since Paris would increase emissions by 10.6 percent by 2030, compared with 2010 levels. This reflects a slight improvement over last year’s assessment, which found that countries were on a path to increase emissions by 13.7 percent by 2030, compared with 2010 levels, the United Nations said.

But nations must reduce their carbon outputs to about 45 percent of their 2010 levels to avoid warming beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) — a threshold at which scientists say humanity can avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change.

Just under half of countries have also submitted long-term plans for bringing their emissions down to zero. If these countries make good on their promises, the U.N. report found, global emissions in the middle of the century could be 64 percent lower than they are now. Scientists say these cuts could keep temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), bringing humanity somewhat closer to tolerable warming levels.

“But it is really not clear if countries will actually pull this off,” warned Joeri Rogelj, a climate scientist at Imperial College London who specializes in global warming pathways.

There are huge discrepancies between nations’ near-term climate pledges and their long-term plans, he noted. For most countries, the emissions trajectories implied by their NDCs would make it almost impossible to achieve a net-zero target by the middle of the century.

The U.N. findings underscore a simple sobering fact, Andersen said: In waiting so long to act on climate change, humanity has denied itself a chance to make a slow and orderly transition to a safer and more sustainable future. Countries must constantly bolster their ambitions, rather than make modest carbon-cutting pledges that get updated every five years. No nation can rest easy until every country has eliminated planet-warming emissions and restored natural systems that can pull carbon out of the atmosphere, she said.

“We need to see more and faster,” she said. “Today you stretch and tomorrow you stretch and the day after you stretch.”

93d97452-6777-4f32-8225-b805ac422b0e,"Leaders will head to the COP27 summit in Egypt in less than two weeks with marginally more ambitious emissions commitments compared to COP26 last year.

Driving the news: A new UN report, released Wednesday, starkly shows the modest momentum towards meeting the world's climate targets during the past year.

The big picture: The UN analysis examines countries' voluntary emissions reduction and climate adaptation pledges, known as nationally determined contributions, or NDCs.

It finds that overall, the world is still falling far short of committing to the emissions cuts needed to meet the Paris targets. That agreement calls for holding warming to ""well below"" 2°C, and preferably to 1.5°C compared to preindustrial levels.

The NDCs would set global average temperatures on a course to increase by about 2.5°C (4.5°F), the report finds.

Studies show some of the most devastating consequences of climate change, such as steeper sea level rise and the demise of tropical coral reefs, are more likely to occur if warming exceeds 1.5°C.

Despite calls in Glasgow for countries to step up with more stringent emissions plans, just 24 did so post-COP26 (through Sept. 23, the cutoff for the report). This may be partly due to the geopolitical turbulence and economic headwinds related to the Ukraine war and lingering effects from the COVID pandemic, which sapped momentum.

By the numbers: The climate report delves deep into the details of the NDCs, including how emissions and eventual warming would be altered if all the unconditional and conditional pledges are met.

The analysis finds that the voluntary pledges are a modest improvement compared to the runup to Glasgow, and show that if countries actually implement them, global emissions may peak before 2030.

However, studies show that is insufficient. In fact, emissions would need to decline by about 45% by 2030 compared to 2010 levels in order to meet the 1.5-degree target, the report and other recent research show.

Instead, they are likely to rise by 10.6% through 2030, down 3.1% from previous expectations.

There is also some good news. Last year's review of voluntary emissions pledges showed that CO2 emissions would continue increasing after 2030, but this is no longer the case in this year's edition.

Context: Given carbon dioxide's long atmospheric lifetime, the world has a finite budget for the amount of emissions before it is virtually certain that warming will reach or exceed the 1.5-degree and 2-degree targets.

For at least a 50% chance of keeping global warming to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels by 2100, projected cumulative CO2 emissions during the 2020-2030 period would likely use up 86% of the remaining emissions budget, based on the latest NDCs.

That means just two years of additional emissions after 2030 would propel global temperatures to 1.5-degrees or higher.

For the 2-degree target, the picture is slightly less daunting.

What they're saying: ""The fact that only 24 new or updated climate plans were submitted since COP 26 is disappointing,"" Simon Stiell, the UN climate chief, said in a statement."
c0c17bda-8bc8-4be1-98da-aa605cccb19d,"The world is ""nowhere near"" hitting its targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions, putting it on track to soar past the limit for global warming that countries committed to in the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement, the United Nations has warned.

That means the planet is on course for a future marked by unprecedented heat waves, destructive storms and drought, as well as the extinction of animal and plant species.

Current plans would see temperatures rise to 2.5 degrees Celsius (4.5 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial averages by the end of the century, the U.N.’s climate office said in a new report Wednesday revealing its latest estimates. That figure, which is based on 193 national emissions targets, is a full degree higher than the goal set out in the Paris climate pact, which aimed to limit warming by 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).

The U.N. said in a news release Wednesday that while countries are “bending the curve of global greenhouse gas emissions downward,” these efforts “remain insufficient to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century.”

Emissions were expected to increase 10.6% by 2030 from 2010 levels, the report said, representing a slight decrease from estimates last year. But the impact of countries' pledges to ramp up their climate fight is falling short, scientists behind the report warned.

“We are still nowhere near the scale and pace of emission reductions required to put us on track toward a 1.5 degrees Celsius world,” Simon Stiell, head of the U.N. climate office, said in a statement. “To keep this goal alive, national governments need to strengthen their climate action plans now and implement them in the next eight years.”

The warning comes as world leaders prepare to gather in Egypt next month for the annual U.N. Climate Change Conference. That will take place against the backdrop of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has driven a mounting international energy crisis and hindered efforts to tackle climate change.

At COP26, last year’s highly anticipated climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, countries had vowed to ramp up their efforts to cut emissions.

The U.N. report analyzed commitments made by nations around the world to curb emissions, known as nationally determined contributions, or NDCs. But it found that just 24 new or updated climate plans were submitted by countries since COP26.

“The fact that only 24 new or updated climate plans were submitted since COP26 is disappointing,"" Stiell said. ""Government decisions and actions must reflect the level of urgency, the gravity of the threats we are facing, and the shortness of the time we have remaining to avoid the devastating consequences of runaway climate change.”

In April, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres warned that the planet was on a ""pathway to global warming of more than double the 1.5 degree limit” that was agreed in Paris in 2015.

“This is not fiction or exaggeration. It is what science tells us will result from our current energy policies,"" he said at the time.

Guterres warned that unless action is taken soon to address the current trend, some major cities will be under water and countries could face “unprecedented heat waves, terrifying storms, widespread water shortages and the extinction of a million species of plants and animals."""

3f7bf043-8fd0-4a3c-b734-a5ce1930d9ab,"Two reports warn about the utter lack of progress in efforts to tackle climate change and point out that the world faces devastating consequences as a result of inaction.

Climate researchers sounded the alarm on Wednesday, saying too little was being done to contain temperature from rising above 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), the threshold after which climate risks heighten.

World leaders agreed to the 1.5-degree threshold at the Paris climate deal in 2015 and agreed to speed up their pledge to cut carbon pollution this decade at last year's UN climate conference in Glasgow.

But a report by the United Nations on Wednesday said only 24 out of 193 countries updated their plans.

It comes as leaders prepare to gather in Egypt for the United Nation's annual climate change conference in November.

New reports on climate action

Another major report on Wednesday, published by a number of leading climate trackers and organizations said warming was already at 1.2 degrees Celsius.

The report, published under the banner of Systems Change Lab, was the result of work by several institutes, including the Bezos Earth Fund, Climate Action Tracker and the World Resources Institute.

The report quantified the gaps in global climate inaction by identifying 40 indicators of systems change required for keeping temperatures below the 1.5-degree mark.

Systemic failure to curb global warming

Of the 40 indicators — ranging from power generation and transport to deforestation and finance — the report found none were on track to reach their 2030 targets.

The power sector was the biggest source of harmful carbon dioxide emissions, with major economies doubling the amounts spent on fossil fuel production between 2020 and 2021.

Coal, one of the most carbon-intensive fossil fuels, accounted for nearly 40% of electricity generation, the report said.

The report added that the unabated use of coal in electricity generation would have to be phased out six times faster than recent global rates.

""The hard truth is that none of the 40 indicators we assessed are on track to achieve their 2030 targets,"" said Sophia Boehm, a researcher at the Systems Change Lab.

The 200-page report identified specific scope for progress, saying a reduction in the annual deforestation rate must accelerate 2.5 times faster and public transport systems such as metros, light-rail and bus networks have to expand six times faster.

Even if 2030 climate goals were fully implemented, the world was still looking at heating by 2.4°C to 2.8°C by end of the century, researchers warned.

Climate financing insufficient

Meanwhile, researchers noted governments and private institutions were failing to deliver on the Paris Agreement goals of aligning financial flows with keeping temperatures within the 1.5 degrees limit.

Emerging markets and global economies have already met with elevated commodity prices, with the World Bank saying Tuesday that developing economies were still looking at even higher volatility.

Climate ministers from European Union countries on Monday agreed to raise their target next year to curb greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris Agreement, but the specifics would have to wait until the bloc finished negotiating several new emission-cutting laws.

European countries, relatedly, have also been debating capping gas prices for weeks to tackle rising energy prices as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

e002743c-d058-4c03-a7a8-23e088bb83f3,"Without more aggressive action to slow the Earth-warming emissions that result from driving gas-powered cars and other dependence on fossil fuels, the planet will be in danger in just a few generations, the United Nations reports.

Only 26 of 193 countries that agreed last year to quicken climate actions have followed through with more ambitious plans to curb greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), according to the latest report from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) out Wednesday.

That means without more aggressive reductions in GHG emissions, the planet is on track to warm by an average of 2.1 to 2.9 degrees Celsius, compared with preindustrial levels, by 2100.

Such an increase far exceeds the goal of 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) set by the landmark Paris agreement in 2015, and it crosses the threshold beyond which many scientists say the likelihood of catastrophic climate impacts — such as drought, hunger, eroding coastlines, increased respiratory issues and more — significantly increases.

“We’re bending the curve on emissions downwards, they are projected to go in the right direction,” U.N. climate change executive secretary Simon Stiell said at a press conference Wednesday.

“But they are not going down enough fast enough, far enough — this is nowhere near the scale of emissions reductions required to put us on track toward a 1.5C world,” he said.

Wednesday’s report hits just a few weeks before nations are set to gather at U.N. climate talks in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt, for the Conference of Parties, or COP27.

And it arrives with the U.K. and Brazil in political turmoil, and with the Russian attack on Ukraine having disrupted global energy markets NG00, -0.01% .

In fact, Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, the Paris-based organization that represents the world’s largest oil-consuming CL00, +3.52% countries, said this week, “The world is in the middle of its first truly global energy crisis.”

Emissions from burning coal, oil and gas account for 70% of the GHG total, according to Energy Department data.

The energy crisis has some U.S. lawmakers urging for a return to more U.S. drilling, in order to cut dependence on Russia and other potentially geopolitical hotbeds. Advocates for alternative energy, such as wind and solar, and in some circles, nuclear, say this approach returns more energy and electric power sourcing closer to home, and thus, less exposed to global swings in supply.

Irreversible changes

The U.N. report out Wednesday analyzed the commitments made by countries to cut their emissions, known as nationally determined contributions, or NDCs. Countries that signed the 2015 Paris agreement promised to update and strengthen their commitments every five years. But in 2021, nations agreed not to wait another five years and instead pledged to make new commitments before the climate talks begin on Nov. 7 in Egypt.

While the consequences of heating above that 2-degree threshold are deemed to be catastrophic, the existing warming of 1.1C above pre-industrial times has already resulted in some irreversible changes, the report warned.

Climate scientists broadly estimate that human-caused greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut by 50% by the end of this decade, and to be eliminated by mid-century in order to keep warming below 2C by 2100. The U.S., under the Biden administration, has aimed for a 50% reduction by 2030, and net-zero emissions by 2050.

Net zero, by most measures, will be reached only by cutting fossil fuel use, switching to EVs — like those produced by Tesla TSLA, +1.97% and General Motors GM, -0.35% — for personal use and in cargo fleets, planting more carbon-absorbing trees and capturing and storing the carbon emissions that countries do emit.

For certain, private and public investment in “green” efforts will need to work in tandem.

A report from BNY Mellon Investment Management this week said that although green investment is growing, more action, ringing up at a lofty $100 trillion, will be required from governments, asset allocators and corporations to facilitate the transition to net zero.

This $100 trillion represents around 15% of total global investment over the next 30 years, or around 3% of global gross domestic product (GDP) over the same period, the group said in its release. Corporations in the S&P 500 SPX, +0.03% alone will need to spend roughly $12 trillion of “green” capital expenditure by 2050 to remain on course.

China-U.S. stalemate

The world’s top two polluters, China and the U.S., have taken some policy steps but have not pledged greater action this year, and climate negotiations between the two have been largely on hold.

China is one of the major holdouts on new emission-cutting commitments, although it surprised much of the world with a targeted net-zero plan issued ahead of the U.N. summit last year. China, at that time, set 2060 as its likely decade to flip to net-zero emissions. China has said its CO2 emissions will continue to grow until they peak by 2030, but it has not set targets for reducing other greenhouse gases, such as methane. Its emissions of methane, a more potent but shorter-lasting GHG, are enough to equal the total emissions of smaller nations.

Last year, China said it would stop building coal-burning power plants overseas. As of August, only about 26 out of 104 such projects had been terminated.

The Biden administration passed earlier this year a spending bill that featured the most attention on climate change to date, the Inflation Reduction Act, but was trimmed from a more ambitious early version. It did follow infrastructure legislation last year that also aimed to upgrade EV charging, energy efficiency and other efforts.

Earlier this week, the European Union said it would increase its emissions reduction pledges “as soon as possible,” but was limited to acting before member states agreed on a number of upcoming climate laws."

The world’s wealthiest nations should deliver on their pledge to provide $100bn per year of climate financing to cut energy bills and boost renewable projects across developing countries, argued clean technology firm Wärtsilä.

It has urged so-called Annex I countries – 40 high-emitting countries across the West to honour its pledges to fund climate change mitigation measures.

This includes reducing greenhouse emissions in developing countries, and adaptation to climate change.

The OCED has tracked the group climate commitments, revealing that they have not reached the $100bn dollar level yet – with financing instead reaching just $83.3bn in 2020.

In its group’s latest research, Wärtsilä calculated that a boost in renewables could provide reliable energy to 100m people across South Africa, Mozambique and Nigeria without power, if it were matched with necessary grid infrastructure.

Its report ‘Pathways for Africa’s Energy Future’ suggests that renewable energy, if deployed effectively, could also cut energy costs by up to 74 per cent in Nigeria and help South Africa solve its load-shedding dilemma and save $26bn by 2032.

Meanwhile, it forecasts that Mozambique could vastly increase access to electricity, currently at 35 per cent of the population.

However, Wärtsilä argues that boosting access to renewable energy will require significant capital injections from developed economies – of up to $119bn for those three countries alone.

It believes that the upcoming COP27 summit in Cairo, Egypt, offers a unique opportunity to increase energy access and lay the foundations for decarbonisation across Africa.

Håkan Agnevall, president and chief executive of Wärtsilä said: “Despite contributing less than three per cent of the world’s energy‐related carbon emissions, African countries are among the hardest hit by climate change.

“The low-hanging fruit of global decarbonisation lies in replacing costly, polluting legacy fossil fuel power plants, with low-cost renewable energy technologies, such as wind and solar, coupled with flexible balancing power.”

17b9d69e-558c-406c-b446-6e5d2e3e3791,"The doctors are merely reiterating somewhat more forcefully than usual the well-known truth: Fossil fuel burning is killing literally millions of us every year: There were 1.2 million premature deaths in 2021 just from airborne PM 2.5 (particulates) alone, 11,800 of those in the United States. If that’s not a health matter deserving physicians’ attention, what is?

Changes in climate from this burning last year boosted heatwave-related deaths worldwide by 68% in vulnerable populations (adults over 65, and infants up to 1), and 74% in the United States, according to the Lancet report. Agricultural workers were among the most affected. Besides the deaths, the doctors calculated that heatwaves meant the loss of 470 billion hours of work in 2021. That’s about 40% more than in the 1990s. The associated economic loss was estimated at about $700 billion. Compared with the 1950s, some 30% more land is now affected by extreme drought events.

I recommend going to the Lancet Countdown visualization page to see bigger and crisper versions of this and the other charts. If you want to read the whole report, you’ll have to register.

The extreme heat, coupled with droughts, has expanded food insecurity to nearly 100 million more people than before, many of them already living on the edge. Epidemiological computer models showed annual heat-related deaths rising from 187,000 a year in 2000-2004 to an annual average of 312,000 in each of the past five years.

And then there are infectious diseases. For instance, periods when malaria could likely be transmitted grew significantly longer compared with the 1950s, and so did the likelihood of dengue transmission, the report stated.

Said University College of London health and climate researcher Dr. Marina Romanello, executive director of the Lancet Countdown, “Our health is at the mercy of fossil fuels. We’re seeing a persistent addiction to fossil fuels that is not only amplifying the health impacts of climate change, but which is also now at this point compounding with other concurrent crises that we’re globally facing, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the cost-of-living crisis, energy crisis and food crisis that were triggered after the war in Ukraine.”

Damian Carrington at The Guardian cited the response to the report of U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, who has been a relentless, if frustrated, voice for serious and just climate action: “The climate crisis is killing us. It is undermining not just the health of our planet, but the health of people everywhere—through toxic air pollution, diminishing food security, higher risks of infectious disease outbreaks, record extreme heat, drought, floods and more.”

Here’s Carrington:

The Lancet report also tracks the fossil fuel system. It found that 80% of the 86 governments assessed were subsidising fossil fuels, providing a collective $400bn in 2019. These subsidies were bigger than national health spending in five countries, including Iran and Egypt, and more than 20% of health spending in another 16 countries. “Governments have so far failed to provide the smaller sum of $100bn per year to help support climate action in lower income countries,” the report notes. The report says the strategies of the 15 biggest oil and gas companies remain sharply at odds with ending the climate emergency, “regardless of their climate claims and commitments”.

In this regard, the Lancet Countdown notes:

[O]il and gas companies are registering record profits, while their production strategies continue to undermine people’s lives and well-being. An analysis of the production strategies of 15 of the world’s largest oil and gas companies, as of February 2022, revealed they exceed their share of emissions consistent with 1·5°C of global heating by 37% in 2030 and 103% in 2040, continuing to undermine efforts to deliver a low-carbon, healthy, liveable future.

At his substack, The Crucial Years, author and veteran climate activist Bill McKibben noted: “I’ve rarely read a more comprehensive, or more devastating report on the effect of global warming. And its authors are pulling no punches.” He goes on to reinforce the message about fossil fuel companies:

My only quibble is that when one says “fossil fuel addiction,” it might summon up an image of the wrong culprit. Humans aren’t addicted to fossil fuels—we’re just as happy getting our power from solar panels or wind turbines. Happier, even. ... This profit—soaring this year thanks to one man, Vladimir Putin—keeps tempting the banks and financial institutions to send more money their way, so they can expand their infrastructure and lock in their dominance decades longer. It’s Big Oil’s that’s addicted to fossil fuel profits—but the side effects are killing the planet.

Big Oil is addicted to something else as well: lying. They’ve stopped outright denial of the climate crisis. Now their ads and press releases are all about how supposedly green they are. Bald-faced lying. By their actions, not their words, shall you know them.

Now, about those glimmers of hope. An energy transition is underway. But still barely so. Acceleration of what’s already happening is key. Some acceleration is happening, though one with all kinds of contradictions, like the notorious provision in the Schumer-Manchin compromise requiring federal oil and gas leases in exchange for wind and solar leases. Like the stepped-up use of coal in China as it simultaneously invests more than the next three countries combined in green expansion.

The following Lancet chart shows the steep rise in the percentage of electricity generated by renewables since the first IPCC climate assessment was written 32 years ago. An encouraging glimmer, to be sure. But that steep climb needs to become even steeper.

Had there not been so much obstructionism, that curve could have been upturned much sooner, and we wouldn’t be so under the gun. But the belated green transition is nevertheless happening all around us now, just as the impacts of climate change are happening all around us. It’s a race, whether we like it or not. And we’re behind. If we manage to speed up the transition, then as the doctors say, we can have healthy energy delivered to people in their homes, reduce energy poverty, and save those millions being killed now with dirty energy.

But to do so requires what the doctors prescribe: ditching those fossil fuels faster. That means we have to generate more renewables faster. And that means upgrading the grid to transmit electricity faster, perhaps the hardest task of all. It’s all of a piece, you can’t have one without the others.

Given the time frame available to us, getting all that done would be helped with the powers the president would gain from declaring a national climate emergency—after the midterms. This wouldn’t give President Joe Biden carte blanche, of course, certainly not if Congress is under partial or complete Republican control come January. But it could help speed along green programs and projects that Congress wouldn’t be able to block. And if the Democrats maintain control of Congress, then the urgency can be further amplified. How much more evidence is required before the response is equal to the gravity of the situation? We’re already dropping dead. Isn’t that enough?

The Lancet report concludes:

With countries facing multiple crises simultaneously, their policies on COVID-19 recovery and energy sovereignty will have profound, and potentially irreversible consequences for health and climate change. However, accelerated climate action would deliver cascading benefits, with more resilient health, food, and energy systems, and improved security and diplomatic autonomy, minimising the health impact of health shocks. With the world in turmoil, putting human health at the centre of an aligned response to these concurrent crises could represent the last hope of securing a healthier, safer future for all.

Report co-author Dr. Renee Salas, a Boston emergency room physician and professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, said, “This isn’t a rare cancer that we don’t have a treatment for. We know the treatment we need. We just need the willpower from all of us and our leaders to make it happen.”

And some arm-twisting."

Climate change is shrinking the difference between the daily high temperature and the daily low in many parts of the world. The gap between the two, known as the diurnal temperature range (DTR), has a significant effect on growing seasons, crop yields, residential energy consumption and human health issues related to heat stress. But why and where the DTR shrinks with climate change has been something of a mystery.

Researchers who are part of a new international study that examined the DTR at the end of the 20th century believe they have found the answer: An increase in clouds, which blocks incoming-shortwave radiation from the sun during the day.

This means that while both the daily maximum temperature and the daily minimum are expected to continue to increase with climate change, the daily maximum temperature will increase at a slower rate. The end result is that the DTR will continue to shrink in many parts of the world, but that the changes will vary depending on a variety of local conditions, researchers said.

The study, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, is the first to use high-resolution computer modeling to delve into the issue of the Earth's shrinking DTR, particularly how it is related to cloud cover.

""Clouds are one of the big uncertainties in terms of climate projections,"" said co-author Dev Niyogi, a professor at The University of Texas at Austin Jackson School of Geosciences. ""When we do this with a very high spatial resolution modeling framework, it allows us to explicitly simulate clouds.""

Lead author Doan Quang Van, an assistant professor at the University of Tsukuba Center for Computational Sciences in Japan, said this is vital for understanding the future of the DTR.

""Clouds play a vital role in the diurnal temperature variation by modulating solar radiative processes, which consequently affect the heat exchange at the land surface, "" he said.

The team included scientists from the UT Jackson School's Department of Geological Sciences, the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Shanghai University of Engineering Science, National Defense Academy of Japan, and the University of Tsukuba in Japan. The modeling work used supercomputers at the University of Tsukuba Center for Computational Sciences.

Using the supercomputers, the team was able to model the complicated interplay of land-surface processes on climate change. These include changes in land use (such as deforestation), soil moisture, precipitation, cloud cover and other factors that can affect the temperature in a local region. By creating a model with a finer resolution grid—2 square kilometer grids rather than the 100-kilometer grids used in most climate models—the researchers were able to more closely analyze the impacts of climate change.

The team focused on two areas: the Kanto region of Japan and the Malaysian peninsula. They used the 10-year period from 2005-2014 as a baseline and then ran different climate scenarios to project what will happen to the DTR in the two regions at the end of the century. They found that the temperature gap closes by about .5 Celsius in the temperate Kanto region and .25 Celsius in the more tropical Malaysian peninsula. Researchers attribute these changes in large part to increased daytime cloud coverage that would be expected to develop under these climate conditions.

The researchers said the study can help scientists improve current global climate models and aid in understanding how the shrinking DTR will affect society and the environment as the climate continues to warm.

""It is very important to know how DTR will change in the future because it modulates human, animal and plant metabolisms,"" said Quang Van. ""It also modulates the local atmospheric circulation such as the land-sea breeze.""

Global fossil fuel emissions are expected to peak in 2025 as countries commit huge sums of money toward low-carbon fuels, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).

In its annual World Energy Outlook report, published Thursday, the agency said that Russia’s assault on Ukraine had the potential to “hasten” the global transition to clean energy sources.

The IEA said it expects global investments in low-carbon energy to increase to $2 trillion a year until the end of the decade — up 50% from today’s spending.

“Energy markets and policies have changed as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, not just for the time being, but for decades to come,” Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA, said in the report.

“Government responses around the world promise to make this a historic and definitive turning point towards a cleaner, more affordable and more secure energy system,” he added.

Since the war broke out in late February, many countries have shunned Russia’s vast energy exports, finding new suppliers and ramping up imports of alternate energy sources.

That has put Moscow in a “much-diminished position,” the IEA said, and Russia is on course for its share of global energy exports drop to 13% by 2030 from 20% last year.

Europe — Moscow’s biggest customer for oil and gas — has borne the brunt of the energy crunch. Benchmark natural gas prices have shot up since the invasion, though have dropped steeply in recent weeks thanks to mild temperatures and the bloc’s successful efforts to store gas for winter.

“Russia [has] lost this market forever. And it will be very difficult [for] this Russian oil and gas [to] find a new home as big as Europe, as lucrative as Europe,” Birol told CNN’s Julia Chatterley in an interview on Thursday.

Earlier this week, Birol said that intense competition for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and cuts in oil output by OPEC and its allies had led to “the first truly global energy crisis,” according to a Reuters.

Thursday’s report will be welcomed by those who’ve worried that the crisis has set the world’s climate goals back.

Fears of energy shortages have led some countries in Europe and China to burn more coal this year. Hard coal power generation jumped nearly 15% between March and September in Europe in 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, according to the Independent Commodity Intelligence Services.

Overall, though, growth in coal burning has been “muted” this year, Birol told CNN.

And, for the first time ever, the IEA’s annual forecast sees demand for all fossil fuel to either peak or plateau. Oil is expected to be the last holdout, reaching a plateau by the mid-2030s, the report said.

“Governments are putting real money on the table to accelerate the green energy [transition], not necessarily for environmental, climate reasons, but mainly for energy security reasons,” Birol told CNN.

Despite the flurry of clean energy investment, the agency said that it expects global temperatures to rise by 2.5 Celsius (4.5 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century — well above the 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) upper limit needed to avert severe consequences for the climate. The world has already warmed 1.2 degrees Celsius since the industrial revolution.

Governments will also need to raise their annual clean energy investments to $4 trillion by 2030 to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, the report said.

“There is still a large gap between today’s pledges and a stabilization of the rise in global temperatures around 1.5°C,” the IEA warned."
2e185c66-e5ff-4351-9910-53ed7c39e056,"The amount of carbon dioxide and two other greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere hit record highs last year, the World Meteorological Organization said in a report published Wednesday.

Carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide are the three main greenhouse gases responsible for trapping heat in the atmosphere and driving global warming. The WMO’s latest Greenhouse Gas Bulletin, published annually, found that concentrations of all three reached new highs last year — a worrying trend and a sign that the world is not doing enough to fight climate change.

“WMO’s Greenhouse Gas Bulletin has underlined, once again, the enormous challenge — and the vital necessity — of urgent action to cut greenhouse gas emissions and prevent global temperatures rising even further in the future,” Petteri Taalas, the WMO’s secretary-general, said in a statement.

The increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide from 2020 to 2021 was larger than the average annual growth rate over the past decade, according to the report. The WMO also said last year's rise in methane levels was the biggest year-on-year jump since such measurements began almost 40 years ago.

Measurements for carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide in 2021 were all above pre-industrial levels, “before human activities started disrupting natural equilibrium of these gases in the atmosphere,” the WMO said.

Concentrations of carbon dioxide, in particular, are closely monitored as an indicator of how humans are influencing Earth's climate. Burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that trap heat in the atmosphere.

A separate report released Wednesday by the United Nations warned that the world is “nowhere near” hitting its targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions, with the planet on track to see temperatures rise to 2.5 degrees Celsius (4.5 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial averages by the end of the century."
c25f0a46-373c-4f27-ac5f-a6f8a5dcfcb3,"Atmospheric levels of all three greenhouse gases have reached record highs, according to a study by the World Meteorological Organization, which scientists say means the world is “heading in the wrong direction”.

The WMO found there was the biggest year-on-year jump in methane concentrations in 2020 and 2021 since systematic measurements began almost 40 years ago.

Methane levels have risen rapidly in recent years, puzzling scientists. Some blamed it on an increase in fracking in the US but this came into doubt as industrial emissions were not showing a similarly sharp rise.

Now the theory is that the methane rise could be caused by activities of microbes in wetlands, rice paddies and the guts of ruminants. Rising temperatures have caused the ideal conditions for microbial methane production, as they enjoy warm, damp areas.

Carbon dioxide levels are also soaring, with the jump from 2020 to 2021 larger than the annual growth rate over the past decade. Measurements from WMO’s global atmosphere watch network stations show these levels continue to rise.

These greenhouse gases cause global heating, with the warming effect rising by 50% between 1990 and 2021. Carbon dioxide comprised about 80% of this increase.

According to the WMO, carbon dioxide concentrations in 2021 were 415.7 parts per million, methane was 1908 parts per billion (ppb) and nitrous oxide was 334.5 ppb. These are respectively 149%, 262% and 124% of pre-industrial levels.

The WMO secretary general, Prof Petteri Taalas, said: “The continuing rise in concentrations of the main heat-trapping gases, including the record acceleration in methane levels, shows we are heading in the wrong direction.”

Though worrying, the methane increase was reversible, and carbon dioxide remained the biggest threat, he added. “There are cost-effective strategies available to tackle methane emissions, especially from the fossil fuel sector, and we should implement these without delay,” Taalas said. “However, methane has a relatively short lifetime of less than 10 years, and so its impact on climate is reversible.

“As the most urgent priority, we have to slash carbon dioxide emissions, which are the main driver of climate change and associated extreme weather, and which will affect climate for thousands of years through polar ice loss, ocean warming and sea level rise.”

However, Taalas said time was running out to tackle the climate emergency as concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere continued to reach new peaks.

“We need to transform our industrial, energy and transport systems and whole way of life. The needed changes are economically affordable and technically possible. Time is running out,” he said.

These figures will be presented at the Cop27 UN climate conference in November, where world leaders will convene in Egypt to make deals on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions."

The amount of methane in the atmosphere is racing ahead at an accelerating pace, according to a study by the World Meteorological Organization, threatening to undermine efforts to slow climate change. The WMO’s Greenhouse Gas Bulletin said that “global emissions have rebounded since the COVID-related lockdowns” and that the increases in methane levels in 2020 and 2021 were the largest since systematic record keeping began in 1983.

“Methane concentrations are not just rising, they’re rising faster than ever,” said Rob Jackson, a professor of Earth system science at Stanford University.

The study comes on the same day as a new U.N. report that says the world’s governments haven’t committed to cut enough carbon emissions, putting the world on track for a 2.5 degree Celsius (4.5 degree Fahrenheit) increase in global temperatures by the end of the century.

The analysis said the level of emissions implied by countries’ new commitments was slightly lower than a year ago but would still lead to a full degree of temperature increase beyond the target level set at the most recent climate summits. To avert the most catastrophic consequences of climate change, scientists say, humanity must limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels.

“Government decisions and actions must reflect the level of urgency, the gravity of the threats we are facing, and the shortness of the time we have remaining to avoid the devastating consequences of runaway climate change,” said Simon Stiell, executive secretary of the U.N. Climate Change Secretariat. “We are still nowhere near the scale and pace of emission reductions required.”

Instead, the U.N. report found, the world is barreling toward a future of unbearable heat, escalating weather disasters, collapsing ecosystems and widespread hunger and disease.

“It’s a dismal, horrendous, incomprehensible picture,” Inger Andersen, executive director of the U.N. Environment Program, said of the world’s current warming path. “That picture is just not a picture we can accept.”

The quickest way to affect the pace of global warming would be cutting emissions of methane, the second-largest contributor to climate change. It has a warming impact 80 times greater than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. The WMO said the amount of methane in the atmosphere jumped by 15 parts per billion in 2020 and 18 parts per billion in 2021.

Scientists are studying whether the unusually large increases in atmospheric methane levels in 2020 and 2021 are the result of a “climate feedback” from nature-based sources such as tropical wetlands and rice paddies, or whether they are the result of human-made natural gas and industrial leakage. Or both.

Methane emitted by fossil sources has more of the carbon-13 isotope than that produced from wetlands or cattle.

“The isotope data suggest it’s biological rather than fossil methane from gas leaks. It could be from agriculture,” Jackson said. He warned that “it could even be the start of a dangerous warming-induced acceleration in methane emissions from wetlands and other natural systems we’ve been worrying about for decades.”

The WMO said that as the planet gets warmer, organic material decomposes faster. If the organic material decomposes in water — without oxygen — this leads to methane emissions. This process could feed on itself; if tropical wetlands become wetter and warmer, more emissions are possible.

“Will warming feed warming in tropical wetlands?” Jackson asked. “We don’t know yet.”

Antoine Halff, chief analyst and co-founder of the firm Kayrros, which does extensive analysis of satellite data, said that “we’re not seeing any increase” in methane generated by fossil sources. He said some countries, such as Australia, had cut emissions while others, such as Algeria, had worsened.

Atmospheric levels of the other two main greenhouse gases — carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide — also reached record highs in 2021, the WMO study said: “The increase in carbon dioxide levels from 2020 to 2021 was larger than the average annual growth rate over the last decade.”

Carbon dioxide concentrations in 2021 were 415.7 parts per million (or ppm), methane at 1908 parts per billion (ppb) and nitrous oxide at 334.5 ppb. These values represented 149 percent, 262 percent and 124 percent of preindustrial levels, respectively.

The report “underlined, once again, the enormous challenge — and the vital necessity — of urgent action to cut greenhouse gas emissions and prevent global temperatures rising even further in the future,” WMO Secretary General Petteri Taalas said.

Like others, Taalas has urged the pursuit of inexpensive techniques for capturing the short-lived methane, especially when it comes to natural gas. Because of its relatively short life span, methane’s “impact on climate is reversible,” he said.

“The needed changes are economically affordable and technically possible. Time is running out,” he said.

The WMO also pointed to the warming of oceans and land as well as the atmosphere. “Of the total emissions from human activities during the 2011-2020 period, about 48 percent accumulated in the atmosphere, 26 percent in the ocean and 29 percent on land,” the report said.

The WMO report comes shortly before the COP27 climate conference in Egypt next month. Last year, in the run-up to the climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland, the United States and European Union took the lead in promoting the Global Methane Pledge, which set a goal of reaching a 30 percent reduction in the atmosphere by 2030. They estimated that could shave 0.2 degrees Celsius off the rise in temperatures that would otherwise take place. So far, 122 countries have signed up for the pledge.

White House climate negotiator John F. Kerry said that in the U.S.-China joint declaration issued in Glasgow, China vowed to release “an ambitious plan” for this year’s climate summit that would move to cut its methane pollution. So far, however, that has not happened and China still has not issued an up-to-date “nationally determined contribution,” or NDC, in the lingo of the United Nations.

“We look forward to an updated 2030 NDC from China that accelerates CO2 reductions and addresses all greenhouse gases,” Kerry said.

“To keep this goal alive, national governments need to strengthen their climate action plans now and implement them in the next eight years,” he said.

Yet the United States is also among the vast majority of nations that have not updated their NDCs this year, something that all countries promised to do when the Glasgow summit ended one year ago.

Just 24 countries have submitted new pledges in the past 12 months — and few of the updated commitments represent a meaningful improvement over their past promises, the U.N. report found. Australia made the most significant changes in its national climate goal, which previously hadn’t been updated since the Paris agreement was signed in 2015.

Altogether, the combined 193 climate pledges made since Paris would increase emissions by 10.6 percent by 2030, compared with 2010 levels. This reflects a slight improvement over last year’s assessment, which found that countries were on a path to increase emissions by 13.7 percent by 2030, compared with 2010 levels, the United Nations said.

But nations must reduce their carbon outputs to about 45 percent of their 2010 levels to avoid warming beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) — a threshold at which scientists say humanity can avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change.

Just under half of countries have also submitted long-term plans for bringing their emissions down to zero. If these countries make good on their promises, the U.N. report found, global emissions in the middle of the century could be 64 percent lower than they are now. Scientists say these cuts could keep temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), bringing humanity somewhat closer to tolerable warming levels.

“But it is really not clear if countries will actually pull this off,” warned Joeri Rogelj, a climate scientist at Imperial College London who specializes in global warming pathways.

There are huge discrepancies between nations’ near-term climate pledges and their long-term plans, he noted. For most countries, the emissions trajectories implied by their NDCs would make it almost impossible to achieve a net-zero target by the middle of the century.

The U.N. findings underscore a simple sobering fact, Andersen said: In waiting so long to act on climate change, humanity has denied itself a chance to make a slow and orderly transition to a safer and more sustainable future. Countries must constantly bolster their ambitions, rather than make modest carbon-cutting pledges that get updated every five years. No nation can rest easy until every country has eliminated planet-warming emissions and restored natural systems that can pull carbon out of the atmosphere, she said.

“We need to see more and faster,” she said. “Today you stretch and tomorrow you stretch and the day after you stretch.”

4fd09415-d189-42e8-b3be-3623a9c42c2d,"Global carbon emissions from energy will peak in 2025 thanks to massively increased government spending on clean fuels in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to analysis by the world’s leading energy organisation.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) said that government spending on clean energy in response to the crisis would mark a “historic turning point” in the transition away from fossil fuels, in its annual report on global energy.

The invasion of Ukraine has prompted an energy crisis around the world, with global gas prices initially surging. The crisis has caused steep inflation that has made households poorer around the world.

Governments have been scrambling to find other sources of energy. Some analysts have questioned whether fears over energy security could lead to the use of fossil fuels for longer, slowing the world’s race to net zero carbon emissions. Some countries – including the US and the UK under previous prime minister Liz Truss – have pledged to encourage fossil fuel extraction to try to ease prices.

However, Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director and one of the world’s most influential energy economists, said the energy crisis caused by Russia’s invasion “is in fact going to accelerate the clean energy transition”.

The IEA said planned investments in green energy in response to the crisis meant that – for the first time – government policies would lead to demand for polluting fossil fuels peaking this decade. The agency cited notable contributions from the US Inflation Reduction Act, the EU’s emissions reduction package, and actions by Japan, South Korea, China and India.

Q&A Which countries contribute most to the climate crisis? Show China produces the most heat-trapping pollution, followed by the US. But historically, the US has contributed more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than any other nation. The US also has high emissions per capita, compared to other developed countries. And Americans buy products made in China, therefore supporting China's carbon footprint. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.

Under the new plans investment in low-carbon energy such as solar, wind and nuclear power will rise to $2tn (£1.7tn) a year by 2030, an increase of more than 50% from today. However, annual clean energy investment would have to reach $4tn by 2030 to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, a figure that illustrates the scale of the challenge facing governments around the world.

The IEA analysis showed that current government policies would still lead to global temperatures rising by 2.5C, which would have catastrophic climate impacts. That would be far above the target of limiting global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The 1.5C target, agreed at the Paris climate conference, would prevent the worst effects of climate breakdown.

The analysis adds to a consensus among scientists that governments are not doing enough to prevent climate disaster. A separate UN study, published on Wednesday, also found that government pledges so far to cut emissions will lead to 2.5C of heating.

The wave of clean energy investment will also cost Russia $1tn in lost fossil fuel revenues by 2030 compared with before the invasion, Birol said. Russia, previously the world’s largest exporter of fossil fuels, would have a “much diminished role in international energy affairs” as the world’s reliance on burning methane gas for power falls, he added.

“The golden age of gas is approaching the end,” Birol said.

Birol said the crisis had not changed the IEA’s assessment, first published last year, that all new fossil fuel projects should stop immediately in order for the world to hit net zero emissions by 2050. New oil and gas extraction projects “will jeopardise our climate goals”, he said.

He also dismissed criticism from some climate deniers that spending on clean energy had contributed to higher energy prices, saying that argument was “hiding who sparked the energy crisis, which is Russia”. The IEA found that higher shares of renewable energy were correlated with lower electricity prices.

“None of the government leaders complained about too much clean energy,” Birol said. “They complain that they don’t have enough clean energy.”"

Summary Companies Greenhouse gas levels hit new record in 2021

Methane surge is highest since data began

Report comes less than two weeks before COP27















LONDON, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Greenhouse gas concentrations climbed at above-average rates to new records last year, the U.N. weather agency said on Wednesday, warning that time is running out for people to make the transformational changes needed to cap global temperature rises.

The annual report by the World Meteorological Organization is the first of several released ahead of a U.N. climate summit next month in Egypt and aims to spur leaders into action.

Hikes in the atmospheric concentration of all three greenhouse gases - carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide - outstripped the average increase over the past decade, it showed, meaning they are now all at new record levels.

Concentrations of the main greenhouse gas carbon dioxide rose by 2.5 parts per million to 415.7 - a level not seen since at least 3 million years ago when the Earth was much warmer. The jump in the potent, heat-trapping gas methane was the highest since records began in 1983, the report said. Methane is the number 2 gas contributing to warming after carbon dioxide.

""The continuing rise in concentrations of the main heat-trapping gases, including the record acceleration in methane levels, shows that we are heading in the wrong direction,"" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas, calling for a transformation in energy, industry and transport systems.

""The needed changes are economically affordable and technically possible. Time is running out,"" he said.

Greenhouse gases are responsible for warming the planet and triggering extreme weather events like heatwaves and intense rainfall. Unlike emissions which can be cut, such as through reduced travel and industry during the pandemic, much of the carbon dioxide emitted decades ago remains in the atmosphere and activates slow processes like sea-level rises over millennia.

The WMO said scientists are investigating the reason for the exceptional hike in methane levels of 18 parts per billion to 1,908 last year following a similar increase in 2020. The largest contribution came from wetlands, landfills and rice paddies - a factor which might be caused by warmer weather speeding up natural decomposition processes, the WMO said.

Oksana Tarasova, a senior scientific officer at the WMO, called for an expansion of the monitoring network, especially near wetlands. ""This is pretty scary. You can't know where you are heading if you don't understand the exact processes,"" she told Reuters.

GENEVA — The three main greenhouse gases hit record high levels in the atmosphere last year, the U.N. weather agency said Wednesday, calling it an ""ominous"" sign as war in Ukraine, rising costs of food and fuel, and other worries have elbowed in on longtime concerns about global warming in recent months.

""More bad news for the planet,"" the World Meteorological Organization said in a statement along with its latest annual Greenhouse Gas Bulletin. It's one of several reports released in recent days looking at several aspects of humanity's struggle with climate change in the run up to the U.N.'s latest climate conference, in Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt.

Of the three main types of heat-trapping greenhouse gases — carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide — the biggest jump from 2020 to 2021 was in methane, whose concentrations in the air came in with the biggest year-on-year increase since regular measurements began four decades ago, WMO said.

""The continuing rise in concentrations of the main heat-trapping gases, including the record acceleration in methane levels, shows that we are heading in the wrong direction,"" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas.

Methane is more potent at trapping heat than carbon dioxide, but doesn't stay in the atmosphere nearly as long as carbon dioxide and there's 200 times more carbon dioxide in the air than methane. Over a 20-year time-period, a molecule of methane traps about 81 times the heat as a molecule of carbon dioxide but over a century it goes down to trapping 28 times more heat per molecule than carbon dioxide, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

Since pre-industrial times, which WMO sets at around the year 1750, CO2 concentrations in the air have increased by nearly 50% to 415.7 parts per million, with the U.S., China and Europe responsible for the bulk of emissions. Methane is up 162% to 1,908 parts per billion, and nitrous oxide — whose human-made sources are things like biomass burning, industrial processes and fertilizer use — is up about one-quarter to 334.5 parts per million.

Earlier on Wednesday the U.N's climate office said current pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions put the planet on course to blow past the limit for global warming countries agreed to in the 2015 Paris climate accord.

It said its latest estimate based on 193 national emissions targets would see temperatures rise to 2.5 degrees Celsius (4.5 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial averages by the end of the century, a full degree higher than the ambitious goal set in the Paris pact to limit warming by 1.5 C (2.7 F).

""We are still nowhere near the scale and pace of emission reductions required to put us on track toward a 1.5 degrees Celsius world,"" the head of the U.N. climate office, Simon Stiell, said in a statement. ""To keep this goal alive, national governments need to strengthen their climate action plans now and implement them in the next eight years.""

The report found that emissions will also increase by 10.6% by 2030 from 2010 levels, a slight decrease from the 13.7% estimates last year.

A report published Wednesday by Climate Action Tracker who track nations' pledges to reduce warming found that of 40 indicators for reducing emissions — like weaning off coal, ramping up electric vehicles or reducing deforestation — the world wasn't on track for any of them to match the levels of emissions reductions scientists say are needed to limit warming to 1.5C. Over half of the indicators showed the world is ""well off track"" to cutting emissions but added that promising progress has been made.

Climatologists and environmental advocates have been raising their voices for years about the impact of climate change, by pointing to vast changes in the weather in recent decades like forest fires in China and western United States, drought in the horn of Africa and unprecedented flooding in Pakistan – to name only a few.

CO2 remains the single most important greenhouse gas generated by human activity — mainly from burning of fossil fuels and cement production — amounting to about two-thirds of the warming effect on the climate, known as radiative forcing. Over the last decade, carbon dioxide has been responsible for about four-fifths of that warming effect.

Methane accounts for about more than one-sixth of the warming effect, said WMO. Three-fifths of methane reaches the atmosphere through the burps and farts of livestock, rice farming, use of fossil fuels, biomass burning and landfills; the rest comes from natural sources like wetlands and termites.

Rob Jackson, who heads the Global Carbon Project, suggested that the spikes in methane over the last two years were ""mysterious"" — either blips related to the coronavirus pandemic, which temporary dented emissions, or a sign of ""a dangerous acceleration in methane emissions from wetlands and other systems we've been worrying about for decades.""

""Concentrations of methane and nitrous oxide are not just rising, they're rising faster than ever. While not losing our focus on carbon dioxide, we need to pay more attention to the 'other' greenhouse gases,"" he added. ""Fortunately, methane is beginning to get the attention it deserves"" through initiatives like the Global Methane Pledge, a capping effort supported by the U.S. and European Union, among others.

Nitrous oxide remains ""mostly ignored,"" he added.

Taalas, who has been repeating warnings about global warming for years, says the focus should remain on CO2.

""As the top and most urgent priority, we have to slash carbon dioxide emissions which are the main driver of climate change and associated extreme weather, and which will affect climate for thousands of years through polar ice loss, ocean warming and sea level rise,"" he said.

NASA announced that an instrument on the International Space Station designed to look at mineral dust turned out to be a useful tool to find ""super emitters"" of methane from orbit. NASA shared three images showing plumes several miles long that are spewing methane.

A group of a dozen leaks from pipeline and other gas infrastructure in Turkmenistan is leaking 55 tons of methane per hour, about the same as the infamous 2015 Aliso Canyon leak, drilling in New Mexico that's spewing 18 tons per hour and a landfill in Iran that's emitting 8 tons per hour.

""We're looking in places where no one is planning to look for methane,"" said NASA instrument scientist Robert Green. ""If it's there we'll see it."""
a0f80369-cb61-492a-840a-8e35da4a27f7,"Methane concentrations in the atmosphere made their biggest-ever registered increase in 2021, as all three main greenhouse gases extended their record high levels, the United Nations said Wednesday.

The U.N.’s World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said levels of climate-warming carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide all reached new records last year.

Methane — which remains in the atmosphere for only about 10 years, but has a much more powerful warming impact than carbon dioxide — had its biggest year-on-year jump in concentrations since systematic measurements began nearly 40 years ago."

This comes as part of the activities of the initiative of ""our country hosts COP 27"" launched by Arab Office for Youth and Environment (AOYE).



In a statement on Sunday, Kenez said that the campaign targeted the foreign and Egyptian participants in the celebrations.

To ensure the success of the COP 27 Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Egyptian presidency of COP 27 staff and representatives of the UNFCCC held a series of meetings to discuss the current geopolitical challenges to the conference leadership.

The meetings, facilitated by the Centre for Multilateral Negotiations (CEMUNE), discussed the “current situation in Ukraine, high energy prices, and predicted economic recession,” said the COP 27 Communication center in a statement.

“The role of the COP Presidency is to align and converge multiple views, and facilitate transparent, inclusive, and fruitful discussion, while consistently advocating for more progress, ambition and solidarity,” Egyptian Foreign Minister and COP 27 President Designate Sameh Shoukry was quoted by the statement."
8423873f-8225-4aa8-93d0-1f15427aafa6,"CAIRO - 24 October 2022: UN High Level Climate Change Champion for Egypt and UN Special Envoy on Financing 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, Mahmoud Mohieldin, stressed the need to link the sustainable development plans with climate finance, especially since the majority of climate finance still depends on countries’ budgets, including low-income countries through the mobilization of national resources.

This came during his speech at the roundtable hosted by Cairo for a high-level group of experts concerned with preparing a report on climate finance.

The report and meeting are commissioned by the Egyptian and British presidencies of the COP27 and COP26 climate conferences, in the presence of Ambassador Wael Abul-Magd, Special Representative of the COP27 President and representatives of a number of international financial and economic institutions. The session discussed the draft report prepared by the group.

Mohieldin stressed the need to strengthen the role of the private sector and multilateral development banks ,praising the concessional financing policies of the International Development Agency (IDA)as one of the most effective mechanisms for providing financing. He added that the scope of these concessional policies can be expanded through multilateral development banks.

The climate champion also highlighted the importance of activating innovative financing methods, such as debt swaps for investment in nature, in addition to supporting carbon markets.

During the session, Ambassador Wael Abul-Magd, Special Representative of the President of the COP27 Conference, stressed the need to attract trillions of dollars to support climate finance, taking into account the priorities of developing countries that suffer from the negative effects of climate change.

On their part, Vera Snungwe and Nick Stern, Chairs of the Independent High-level Expert Group on Climate Finance, thanked the Egyptian COP27 Presidency for hosting the meeting and the Climate Champions for the support of the work of the group.

The chairs of the meeting explained that the report us monitoring the most prominent gaps related to climate financing, identifying their causes and proposing recommendations for mobilizing the necessary financing to support climate action .The also stressed the vital role of multilateral development banks, and development finance institutions as a whole, in participating strongly not only in creating conditions for investment, but also in action to manage, reduce and share risks.

The two chairs of the group indicated their keenness to include the observations and suggestions that were put forward during today's meeting in order to develop the draft report

The climate champion noted that the group is to meet today the prime minister, in the presence of a number of ministers, in the framework of preparations for the upcoming climate summit to be held in Sharm El-Sheikh next November."

Egypt, which will host the UN climate talks next month, has warned participating countries not to use ""economic pessimism"" as a pretext for a possible backtracking on climate pledges.

""There has been concern that the current state of affairs that countries may backtrack,"" said Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry.

""Backtracking on the antagonistic political positions that exist ... because of the pressures of the overall global economic circumstances and therefore using what would be extenuating circumstances to justify their backtracking.... This would be, I think, a very counterproductive stance,"" Shoukry told dpa in an interview.

The UN climate summit, known as COP27, will be held in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheikh from Nov. 6-18 against the backdrop of the Ukraine war that has sent food and energy prices soaring.The conference also comes after disparate climate-related events have wreaked havoc in some parts of the world.

Representatives from around 200 countries will discuss how global warming can be contained and how climate damage can be financed. And the host has promoted COP27 as a summit of action.

""We see COP27 as the COP of implementation where states and parties will highlight their commitment to implement their previous commitments and lay the groundwork for the future in terms of additional commitments that address the challenges,"" Soukry has said.

For him, success depends on the determination and political will of the parties involved, as well as an understanding that rich and poor countries are affected equally, ""regardless of the seas that divide them.""

He cited recent devastating floods in Pakistan, heat waves in Europe and hurricanes in the United States as catalysts for climate stakeholders to act.

""People are losing their lives,"" said Shoukry, who is the COP27 chair-designate. ""If the international community of parties does not rise to the occasion, they will be responsible for the deteriorating situation and the continued suffering of a large segment of the world's population.""

Shoukry hoped that divergence over geopolitical tensions ""would not be imported"" into the COP process. ""There are other places to address these issues. And certainly, here, the focus should be on climate change.""

However, the official sees a ""trust deficit"" because of the failure to meet previous commitments. In 2009, developed countries pledged to provide $100 billion a year in funding by 2020 for climate protection in poor countries.The pledge remains largely unfulfilled.

Shoukry called the $100 billion figure ""miniscule"" on the scale of the globe and in terms of the capabilities of developed countries, whose budgets sometimes reach trillions of dollars. ""It certainly has no real impact on the challenges of climate change,"" he concluded.

""It's a minuscule amount that should have been met.... So meeting it is still important, but we also need to be practical, we need to do much more for it to have an impact."" But how to make these funds available is a matter of collective will, according to Shoukry.

COP27 will also address how global warming can be limited to a temperature rise of 1.5 degrees Celsius, a target set in the 2015 Paris agreement. In Shoukry's view, the assumption that the target has been out of reach for a long time is justified. ""If you address the enormity of the problem and its impact, and also the need to have ambition, you can make that assessment,"" he has said.

""But it really doesn't help us for the future. If we're going to assess shortcomings in the past, I think that shouldn't prevent us from maintaining ambition for the future, or else we'll find ourselves in a vicious cycle of ineffectiveness."" ""

The UN climate talks in Egypt mark the first time they have been held in Africa in years, since the COP held in Morocco in the north of the continent in 2016. Having the summit in Egypt raises Africa's hopes that the rich world will inject more money into the fight against climate change, the representative understands.

""There are ambitions and expectations not only of African states, but shared by the broader community of developing countries associated with their ability to fulfill their responsibilities and commitments within the context of shared but differentiated responsibilities,"" Shoukry has said.

Some human rights groups have expressed concern about possible restrictions on the meaningful participation of environmental activists at COP27, but Shoukry said his country wants to provide civil society groups with a ""receptive and comfortable"" environment. ""We have every desire for civil society to be present, to be given the same rights and privileges (as) at any other COP.""

Egypt, where street protests are restricted, has said activists will be allowed to demonstrate in a designated area adjacent to the conference venue."

Following last year’s Cop26 gathering in Glasgow, the conference from the 6th to the 18th will again see world leaders and their teams of negotiators come together to thrash out deals to safeguard the future of the planet.

Cop27 is open to all parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the landmark treaty signed by many nations at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

That treaty was aimed at reining in “dangerous human interference with the climate system” - and later led to the emissions-cutting deals Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement.

Observer organisations like environmental NGOs, think-tanks and faith-based groups, as well as members of the media and the general public, are also allowed to attend.

More than 200 governments have been invited to take part although not all world leaders have confirmed their attendance.

Despite Cop27 coinciding with the US Midterms elections, President Joe Biden will reportedly join climate envoy John Kerry in Egypt. The White House has been reluctant to discuss travel plans in detail, and whether the US leader will sit down with Chinese Premier Xi Jinping is not yet known.

Russian leader Vladimir Putin, a pariah due to the war in Ukraine, is not expected to show up although the Kremlin could still send delegates to the summit.

As host nation, Egypt has called on countries otherwise hostile to one another to put their differences aside and “show leadership” for the greater good of the planet.

Also set to miss out was new UK prime minister Rishi Sunak, who has since U-turned on that snub and will now be there.

His initial decision to prioritise Britain’s Autumn Budget over the summit was blasted as a “massive failure of leadership” by Labour’s shadow climate secretary Ed Miliband and his party leader Sir Keir Starmer.

The PM’s environment secretary, Therese Coffey, then made matters worse by attempting to justify the call by saying it was “standard practice” and downplaying Cop27 as “just a gathering of people in Egypt”.

Alok Sharma MP, who was UK president of Cop26, will also attend despite losing his Cabinet post in Mr Sunak’s first reshuffle. It is also possible that Ms Coffey, foreign secretary James Cleverly and/or business secretary Grant Shapps will be there.

Mr Sharma appeared before a number of parliamentary committees on Mr Sunak’s first day in office and said the government should “explain and demonstrate” how pivoting back towards fossil fuel exploitation is consistent with the fight against climate change.

Egyptian diplomat Mohamed Nasr has implored Britain to play a significant role at Cop27. “We know that there are challenges, economic challenges that are there, facing the UK and other countries, but we hope that those challenges does not lead to backsliding on the pledges,” he told Sky News.

Egypt’s ambassador also said that he hopes King Charles III will rethink skipping the summit, a decision held over from Liz Truss’s brief tenure as PM as part of a bid to keep the new monarch at one remove from “political” concerns.

The invitation is “still there, it’s an open invitation”, Mr Nasr said. “He has been a very strong advocate for climate action.

He has been a role model for... putting not only his political weight behind the climate change discussion, but also that he has been influencing and giving the right image for how royalty can push for the climate agenda.

“So we hope that he will be there, and we still hope that he can make it and come and come to Sharm El-Sheikh.”

Ms Coffey has since said that it is “up to” His Majesty “to decide how he chooses where to put his priorities in his reign as king”.

Earlier this month, Wael Aboulmagd, a special representative for the Cop27 presidency, told Reuters that around 90 nations had confirmed they would be in attendance, although he did not name specific countries.

“We’ve received a large number of confirmations from around the world, I think the last count was about 90 heads of state but the numbers keep coming in,” he said.

“What we’ve decided is that our heads of state section will not be a traditional plenary-only type of affair, but rather there will be six roundtables... for heads of state to actually engage in a discussion on the issue at hand.”

The guest list continues to grow as we get closer to the opening date, with Hollywood superstar and environmental activist Leonardo DiCaprio a possible attendee once again, the actor having clearly enjoyed his time in Scotland a year ago.

Fouad pointed out to the extended cooperation between Egypt and Australia in the fields of mutual interest including water, biological diversity and standing against any impacts of climate change.



Fouad urged the Australian side to participate in the day of biological diversity in COP 27 which discusses the impact of climate change on biological diversity especially the coral reefs in addition to standing on the Australian experiment on the impact of climate change on their natural and economic resources and the measures taken to reduce these impacts.



Meanwhile, Wabenhorst asserted Australia’s keenness on participating in COP 27 at the governmental and private sector levels.



He said that his country will present its ideas and experiments during the event, pointing out to the Australian companies operating in Egypt in the field of environmental solutions in addition to its keenness to take part in the Egyptian presidential initiatives to be launched for the event.



He asserted the keenness of his country on the initiatives of the already existing solutions, adaptation and flexibility in water, just transition of energy in Africa and electric transition.

It has been characterised as the “implementation” conference with a focus on how the targets agreed to at COP26 will be reached. The conference is keenly watched by investors and the UN has flagged a focus on how to fund the climate transition and mobilise the trillions of dollars needed to finance it.

At the same time, governments across the world have been grappling with the impact of the deepening energy crisis, raising concerns of a diminishing focus on meeting climate targets."
7e6d411c-1e6f-44fa-b266-def299c1aa15,"Labor has revamped Australia’s response to climate change and environmental degradation, redirecting nearly $750m in Coalition commitments, including some spending on gas and carbon capture and storage.

As revealed by Guardian Australia, the first Albanese government budget scrapped a Scott Morrison-era electricity generation underwriting scheme that was promised, but failed, to build up to five new gas-fired power generators and six hydro plants. It also reduced and “realigned” support for CCS away from new fossil fuel developments.

Instead, the government promised $141m over a decade to develop CCS in “hard-to-abate” industries in which there were few alternatives to cut emissions, such as cement manufacturing. Some of the funding would also be directed to “negative emissions” technologies that aim to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it, such as direct air capture.

But the bulk of that CCS funding has been delayed until after the four-year period set out in the budget papers, pushing it beyond 2025 – and the next election.

The government confirmed previously announced climate and environment commitments, including $20bn over 10 years for its rewiring the nation program to provide low-cost finance for new electricity transmission links. About $6bn of that was promised last week to help build the Marinus link – two new subsea transmission cables across Bass Strait – and the Kerang link between Victoria and New South Wales.

It said it would establish a $1.9bn “powering the regions” fund to support jobs and emissions cuts in regional areas. There was $47.1m over four years for the Climate Change Authority, which has been given an expanded advisory role after having its funding slashed by the Coalition, $306.5m for community batteries and and solar banks and an extra $275m for electric and zero emissions vehicle charging.

The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, said: “This is Australia’s roadmap to delivering cleaner, more affordable energy to households and businesses, putting us on track to be a renewable energy superpower.”

One of the biggest changes in the budget was the inclusion for the first time of a statement on the fiscal impact of climate change. It said physical impacts such as higher average temperatures and more extreme weather events would increasingly affect Australia’s fiscal position.

As they became more frequent, they would lower productivity, damage physical capital and disrupt some regions and industries. This would erode the country’s tax base and “put upward pressure on expenditure” – in other words, force governments to spend more.

The government said it would include indicators of the impact of climate change and a list of climate spending in each budget. It said it would ensure climate considerations were better incorporated in decision-making by training the public service and rebuilding Treasury’s climate modelling capability.

The budget papers made clear the impact of climate change was already being felt. They included preliminary estimates that this month’s current floods would lower GDP growth by about 0.25 percentage points. The damage was expected to add 0.1 percentage points to inflation in this quarter and again next quarter, mainly due to higher fruit and vegetable prices and supply chain disruptions.

A table of key climate-related spending lists $24.9bn in commitments over the next eight years, with rewiring the nation and powering the regions the largest.

In the environment portfolio, the government promised $1.8bn in what the minister, Tanya Plibersek, called a “down payment on strong action to protect, restore and manage” nature. The biggest chunk was a previously announced $1.2bn for programs to support the Great Barrier Reef promised over a decade.

Labor’s climate and environment programs were funded in part by redirecting $746.9m from programs promised by the Coalition, including $325.9m from an energy and emissions reduction program that included money for gas and CCS projects and $89.9m that had been dedicated to the former government’s low-emissions technology investment roadmap, which also included support for CCS.

It said it saved $63.9m by abolishing the underwriting new energy generation program and committed the funding to energy storage technologies.

The budget also revealed dramatically different priorities on water projects compared with the Coalition’s last budget in March. Major projects championed by the Nationals to expand agriculture, including Hells Gate Dam, the Hughenden irrigation scheme in Queensland and the Dungowan and Wyangala dams in NSW, have been dumped or postponed. Instead the government has allocated $278m over five years for “nationally significant transformational projects”, such as securing Cairns’ water supply.

It said the Murray-Darling Basin Authority would get a boost of $51.9m over five years to update its understanding of climate change and its impacts on the basin. It would also receive $22.9m “to update the science of water management”.

The budget also included an unpublished amount of “initial funding” towards “meeting the environmental water targets in the plan” – likely to be funds for more voluntary water buybacks. It has become clear that neither NSW nor Victoria will meet commitments under the plan by 2024."

The ambitious clean energy agenda, announced in Tuesday night’s budget, also includes a plan to have renewable energy provide 82 per cent of the electricity network by 2030, which the government promised during the election campaign would also cut power bills by $275 by 2025.

Minister for Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen says the budget is Australia’s roadmap to cleaner, cheaper energy. Credit:AP

The renewables push could create political risk because any cost blow outs on tens of billions of dollars of clean energy projects would need to be recouped through taxes or power bills. The budget also forecast energy prices to rise 30 per cent.

The budget papers revealed the government has beefed up its threat to gas companies, following warnings earlier this month from Treasurer Jim Chalmers and Industry Minister Ed Husic that they must deliver more affordable energy to the local market."
b10b18bb-a88c-4645-a130-355a70ef717d,"For the first time, climate risk tops the list of experts’ concerns in all regions of the world and becomes the main concern of the general public in the United States. This is according to the ninth edition of the Axa Future Risks Report.

For experts in Europe, the top ten concerns for 2022 are:

1. Climate change

2. Geopolitical instability

3. Cyber security risks

4. Energy risks

5. Natural resources and biodiversity risks

6. Social tensions and movements

7. Pandemics and infectious diseases

8. Macro-economic risks

9. Financial stability risks

10. Monetary and fiscal policy risks



95% of the experts surveyed expect geopolitical tensions to persist and spread throughout the world. As an indirect consequence, energy-related risks are now in fourth place, up from 17th place last year.



Economic risks are increasing and fueling social tensions. For the first time, experts rank three economic risks in their top 10: financial instability, macroeconomic deterioration and monetary and fiscal stress. Inflation is becoming an important concern for both experts and the general public.



In the general population, the feeling of vulnerability remains at a very high level (80% of respondents consider themselves more vulnerable than five years ago), and is even increasing in the face of certain risks such as climate change and the energy crisis.

Insufficient preparedness = lower confidence

Furthermore, confidence in certain categories of decision-makers to find solutions is worsening, particularly regarding public authorities (58% vs. 62% in 2021), private companies (45% vs. 47% in 2021) and even scientists (66% vs. 75% in 2021).

This general trend can be explained by the fact that the public believes that the level of preparation of public authorities for certain risks - such as climate change, cyber or geopolitical tensions - is insufficient.



“The 2022 edition of AXA’s Future Risk Report describes an overheated world, where crises are stacked on each other”, said Thomas Buberl , CEO of AXA.

”It also confirms underlying trends such as the fear of climate change, a heightened sense of vulnerability among populations and the decline in trust in major institutions to find sustainable solutions.”



“These trends point to an additional risk, the feeling of powerlessness, at a time when we need the mobilization of all actors to provide collective, innovative and coordinated responses.”

The latest survey is based on responses from a panel of 4,500 risk experts from 58 countries and a representative sample of 20,000 people from 15 countries. This report is produced in partnership with the IPSOS research institute and the geopolitical analysis consultancy Eurasia Group."

Risks related to a changing climate, such as extreme weather events, have become the number one issue that might negatively affect businesses and countries going forward, according to a survey of risk specialists and the public conducted by AXA SA.

The French insurer said Monday that, for the first time, the climate has topped the list of experts' concerns in all regions of the world and has become the central issue worrying the general public in the U.S., too.

Geopolitical risks came in second, with 95% of the experts surveyed saying they expect geopolitical tensions to persist and spread worldwide. Geopolitical risks overtook cybersecurity and pandemic-related threats, AXA said.

""The report confirms underlying trends such as the fear of climate change, a heightened sense of vulnerability among populations, and the decline in trust in major institutions to find sustainable solutions,"" said AXA CEO Thomas Buberl.

The news comes as regulators crack down on climate risks with mandatory corporate disclosures and stress tests that measure banks' resilience against extreme weather events and the transition away from fossil fuels.

Although climate change doesn't affect every company's bottom line in the same way, it can involve both physical risks leading to unexpected losses and transition risks from government policies that force a move away from the most polluting energy sources.

42064469-6b15-4c03-8652-57e56147f575,"In a study published in PNAS, professor Jessica Tierney of the University of Arizona and colleagues have produced globally complete maps of the carbon-driven warming that occurred in the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), 56 million years ago.

While the PETM has some parallels to present warming, the new work includes some unexpected results—the climate response to CO 2 then was about twice as strong as the current best estimate by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). But changes in rainfall patterns and the amplification of warming at the poles were remarkably consistent with modern trends, despite being a very different world back then.

A different world

The warming of the PETM was triggered by a geologically rapid release of CO 2 , primarily from a convulsion of magma in Earth’s mantle at the place where Iceland is now situated. The magma invaded oil-rich sediments in the North Atlantic, boiling off CO 2 and methane. It took an already warm, high-CO 2 climate and made it hotter for tens of thousands of years, driving some deep-sea creatures and some tropical plants to extinction. Mammals evolved smaller, and there were big migrations across continents; crocodiles, hippo-like creatures, and palm trees all thrived just 500 miles from the North Pole, and Antarctica was ice-free.

As our climate warms, scientists are increasingly looking at past climates for insights, but they are hampered by uncertainties in temperature, CO 2 levels, and the exact timing of changes—prior work on the PETM had temperature uncertainties on the order of 8° to 10° C, for example. Now Tierney’s team has narrowed that uncertainty range to just 2.4° C, showing that the PETM warmed by 5.6° C, a refinement on the previous estimate of approximately 5° C.

“We were really able to narrow that estimate down over previous work,” said Tierney.

The researchers also calculated the CO 2 levels before and during the PETM derived from isotopes of boron measured in fossil plankton shells. They found CO 2 was about 1,120 ppm just before the PETM, rising to 2,020 ppm at its peak. For comparison, preindustrial CO 2 was 280 ppm, and we’re currently at about 418 ppm. The team was able to use these new temperature and CO 2 values to calculate how much the planet warmed in response to a doubling of CO 2 values, or the “Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity” for the PETM.

Highly sensitive

The IPCC’s best estimate for climate sensitivity in our time is 3° C, but that comes with a large uncertainty—it could be anything between 2° to 5° C—due to our imperfect knowledge of feedbacks in the Earth system. If the sensitivity turns out to be on the higher end, then we’ll warm more for a given amount of emissions. Tierney’s study found the PETM climate sensitivity was 6.5° C—more than double the IPCC best estimate.

A higher number is “not too surprising,” Tierney told me, because earlier research had indicated Earth’s response to CO 2 is stronger at the higher CO 2 levels of Earth’s past. Our climate sensitivity won’t be that high: “We don't expect that we're going to experience a climate sensitivity of 6.5° C tomorrow,” Tierney explained.

Their paper does, however, suggest that if we continue to raise CO 2 levels, it will nudge the temperature response to that CO 2 higher. “We might expect some level of increased climate sensitivity in the near future, especially if we emit more greenhouse gases,” Tierney said.

Mapping climate by “Data Assimilation”

The new, sharper picture emerges from the way Tierney’s team dealt with geologists’ perennial problem: We don’t have data for every place on the planet. Geological data for the PETM is limited to locations where sediments from that time are preserved and accessible—typically either via a borehole or outcropping on land. Any conclusions about global climate must be scaled up from those sparse data points.

“It's actually a hard problem,” remarked Tierney. “If you want to understand what's happening spatially, it's really hard to do that from just the geological data alone.” So Tierney and colleagues borrowed a technique from weather forecasting. “What weather folks are doing is they're running a weather model, and as the day goes on, they take measurements of wind and temperature, and then they assimilate it into their model … and then run the model again to improve the forecast,” Tierney said.

Instead of thermometers, her team used temperature measurements from the remains of microbes and plankton preserved in 56 million-year-old sediments. Instead of a weather model, they used a climate model that had Eocene geography and no ice sheets to simulate the climate just before, and at the peak of, PETM warmth. They ran the model a bunch of times, varying CO 2 levels and Earth’s orbital configuration because of the uncertainties in those. Then they used the microbe and plankton data to select the simulation that best fit the data.

“The idea is really to take advantage of the fact that model simulations are spatially complete. But they are models, so we don't know if they're right. The data know what happened, but they're not spatially complete,” explained Tierney. “So, by blending them, we get the best of both worlds.”

To see how well their blended product matched reality, they checked it against independent data derived from pollen and leaves, and from places not included in the blending process. “They actually matched up really, really well, which is somewhat comforting,” said Tierney.

“The novelty of this study is to use a climate model to rigorously work out what climate state best fits the data both before and during the PETM, giving patterns of climate change all over the globe and a better estimate of global mean temperature change,” said Dr. Tom Dunkley Jones of the University of Birmingham, who was not part of the study."

Curtin University researchers studying molecular fossils or ""biomarkers"" from deep beneath the Chicxulub impact crater have found evidence of how microorganisms changed in response to fluctuations in the Earth's climate, offering clues about how the planet and life forms may respond to climate change in our modern world.

Lead author, Curtin Ph.D. graduate Dr. Danlei Wang, from Curtin's WA-Organic and Isotope Geochemistry Center (WA-OIGC) said variations in the Earth's orbit around the sun over thousands of years were known to cause changes to our planet's climate and environment.

""The Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO) about 50 million years ago, which was the Earth's warmest period in the past 65 million years, has been linked to the orbital cycles of our planet around the sun,"" Dr. Wang said.

""We performed geochemical studies including biomarker analysis on a sediment core retrieved from the Chicxulub crater in the Gulf of Mexico, to learn how microbial ecosystems responded to Earth's orbital cycles near the end of the EECO. Cyclostratigraphy, which studies astronomically-driven climate cycles within sedimentary deposits, was carried out in collaboration with Kiel University.""

""Our study found orbital cycles that control Earth's climatic variations such as rainfall and terrestrial run-off result in changes in microbial communities, onset of algal blooms and stagnation of the oceans including toxic conditions at the Chicxulub site.""

Research co-author ARC Laureate Fellow, John Curtin Distinguished Professor Kliti Grice, Director of WA-OIGC, said it was the highest-resolution molecular-level geochemical study ever undertaken to provide evidence of a link between variations in the Earth's orbit and the effect of this on ancient environments preserved in rock record at the end of the EECO period.

""What we found as having happened near the Chicxulub site at the end of the EECO cycle may have also occurred elsewhere around the world at other times during the Paleogene period, which spanned about 43 million years and included the EECO,"" Professor Grice said.

""In addition, geologic records containing such orbital-driven geochemical signals from a 'greenhouse' period in the Earth's history can provide clues to predict how environments and life may respond to climate change in the future.""

The authors are also affiliated with The Institute for Geoscience Research (TIGeR), Curtin's flagship Earth Sciences research institute.

For more than 30 years top scientists from across the globe have worked together every several years to draft a report on climate change and what causes it and with each report — and increases in global temperatures — they have become more and more certain that climate change is caused by human activities. In the latest version of their report they said: “It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land.”

Scientists — including the late Ralph Cicerone, the former president of the National Academy of Scientists — have told The Associated Press their confidence in climate change being a human caused problem is equivalent to their certainty in understanding that cigarettes are deadly.

One way to show humans caused the warming “is by eliminating everything else,” said Princeton University climate scientist Gabe Vecchi.

Scientists can calculate how much heat different suspects trap, using a complex understanding of chemistry and physics and feeding that into computer simulations that have been generally accurate in portraying climate, past and future. They measure what they call radiative forcing in watts per meter squared.

The first and most frequent natural suspect is the sun. The sun is what warms Earth in general providing about 1,361 watts per meter squared of heat, year in year out. That’s the baseline, the delicate balance that makes Earth livable. Changes in energy coming from the sun have been minimal, about one-tenth of a watt per meter squared, scientists calculate.

But carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels is now trapping heat to the level of 2.07 watts per meter squared, more than 20 times that of the changes in the sun, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Methane, another powerful heat-trapping gas, is at 0.5 watts per meter square.

The sun’s 11-year cycle goes through regular but small ups and downs, but that doesn’t seem to change Earth’s temperature. And if anything the ever so slight changes in 11-year-average solar irradiance have been shifting downward, according to NASA calculations, with the space agency concluding “it is therefore extremely unlikely that the Sun has caused the observed global temperature warming trend over the past century.”

In other words, the sun had an alibi.

The other natural suspects — volcanoes and cosmic rays — had even less influence during the last 150 years of warming, scientists conclude.

The other way to show that it is carbon dioxide causing warming is by building what Vecchi calls “a causal chain.”

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration records measured on a Hawaiian volcano show rising carbon dioxide levels as do ice records that go back thousands of years. But the key is what type of carbon dioxide.

There are three types of carbon-containing material. Some contain light carbon, or carbon-12. Some contain heavy carbon or carbon-13 and still others contain radioactive carbon-14.

Over the last century or so, there’s more carbon-12 in the atmosphere compared to carbon-13 and less carbon-14 in recent decades, according to NOAA. Carbon-12 is essentially fossil carbon from long ago, as in fossil fuels. So the change in the ratio of carbon-12 to carbon-13 tells scientists the carbon in the air is more from burning fossil fuels than natural carbon, Vecchi said.

That’s the fingerprint of burning coal, oil and natural gas.

And finally, rich countries worry about how to close the door once it’s been opened. Would reparations that seem to indicate guilt expose them to gigantic legal liabilities for damage on a planetary scale? Studies estimate, after all, that annual loss and damage finance needs in developing countries will be between $200 to $580 billion a year by 2030. Yet the safeguards rich countries have already imposed would also limit that liability: Developed countries added a clause to the Paris Agreement to clarify that the article on loss and damage “does not involve or provide a basis for any liability or compensation”.

Climate reparations must also overcome hurdles that have not applied in past instances. For one, the crime is not only ongoing but accelerating—more than half of all carbon dioxide emissions have occurred since 1990. For another, the guilty and the wronged can switch places: By some point in the late 2020s, China will have emitted more greenhouse gases than the EU countries ever have. Yet for the purposes of U.N. climate talks, China is officially a developing country that would be a recipient of loss and damage funds. And there’s a serious first mover problem: Would EU countries agree to hand over large sums for loss and damage if Canada or the U.S. refused to budge? Denmark recently became the first rich country to make a substantial loss and damage pledge—$13 million. But that’s still minuscule in the context of these talks."

A ""strong mandate"" was needed to keep the conclusions of last year's summit ""alive"" and convince other countries to follow the EU's lead, EU climate chief Frans Timmermans said on Monday (24 October). But it took lengthy negotiations to get all 27 countries to agree to update the bloc's climate target ""as soon as possible.""

Student or retired? Then this plan is for you.

The EU had already pledged to reduce carbon emissions by 55 percent in 2030 as part of its 12,000-page 'Fit for 55' legislative proposal, but EU officials now hope some measures can be revised upwards.

For example, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in May, the EU wants to expand renewable energy quicker and increase energy savings to reduce dependency on imported Russian fuels, which may also increase emission reduction by a few percentage points in the next years.

""Carbon emissions will be reduced even faster than before,"" Timmermans said.

Loss and damage

Ministers also agreed to support putting compensation for countries hit by climate change — so-called loss and damage — on the agenda at the climate summit in Egypt.

However, no concrete commitments were made, and the wording of the negotiating document remains vague, only signalling a ""readiness to engage constructively with partners.""

Twelve years ago, at a United Nations climate summit in Copenhagen, rich nations pledged to channel €100bn a year to developing countries by 2020, but so far have not yet delivered on that promise.

But disastrous flooding in Pakistan, with costs now estimated at €40bn, has sharpened calls for support from wealthy countries. ""Despite having less than 1 percent share in global carbon emission, Pakistan is one of the ten countries most affected by climate change,"" prime minister Shehbaz Sharif said on 19 October.

Climate diplomats met at an informal summit in the Democratic Republic of Congo at the start of October to find a middle ground on climate finance and avoid an explosive fight that would derail the Egyptian conference.

One of the most concrete proposals to address the lack of funding came from the Alliance of Small Island States (Aosis), which proposed a Loss and Damage Response Fund.

It would raise money from governments in regular voluntary fundraising rounds in a similar model to the UN's €100bn Green Climate Fund.

Establishing such a fund ""must be the end goal at COP27"", the 39 low-lying island alliance vowed when presenting the proposal in September.

""We have run out of time to waste — our islands are being hit with more severe and more frequent climate impacts, and recovery comes at the cost of our development,"" said Walton Webson, ambassador of 39 small island nations in a September statement. ""GDP losses from tropical cyclones average at 3.7 percent per year. Why must our islands, which contribute the least to the emissions that cause this crisis, pay the highest price?""

An earlier rendition of the fund was proposed at the COP26 Glasgow summit last year but was rejected by wealthy countries."
950107f7-701e-4c95-8b57-6e46a1df2d4f,"In some circles, it’s known as climate reparations. In others, payments for “loss and damage.”

Whatever the term, there are growing calls for a new process that would pay developing countries for damages they’ve suffered from climate change—a problem they did little to create.

Wealthy nations such as the United States have opposed the idea for years. But its advocates have stayed persistent as climate impacts have grown more severe, and the topic is expected to be one of the main issues—and potentially the most divisive—at the next round of international climate talks next month in Egypt.

Here’s a quick guide to climate reparations and why they matter.

1. What are they?

Climate reparations—or “loss and damage” in U.N. speak—account for the economic toll of climate-fueled disasters, such as floods, wildfires and hurricanes. There are also slow-onset climate impacts, such as sea-level rise, that can produce irreversible damage over time.

Taken together, these are climate change impacts that countries can’t defend against, either because the risks are unavoidable or because countries don’t have the money to pay for protection.

One example is the Pacific island nation of Tuvalu, which is rapidly losing its coastline to rising seas (Climatewire, Sept. 23).

Because of this and other climate impacts, a country can lose homes, farmland and jobs—damaging economic growth. Governments can take steps to adapt, but when impacts exceed adaptation, it’s considered loss and damage.

Finding a way to compensate developing countries for climate losses, however, is a contentious topic.

2. What are they not?

Payment for climate reparations differs from funding that goes toward mitigation or adaptation—two established pillars of climate action.

Mitigation refers to efforts to cut the greenhouse gas emissions that are warming the planet by, for example, switching from coal-fired power to solar or wind. Adaptation helps protect against climate-related damages.

Loss and damage is considered a third pillar, and in many ways, it exists because actions to reduce emissions and support adaptation have fallen short.

“We have been doing mitigation, we have been doing adaptation, but both inadequately,” said Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Bangladesh. “Now it’s no longer something we are preparing for or trying to prevent. But it’s something we’re going to have to deal with.”

That doesn’t mean that mitigating climate change and adapting to its impacts still aren’t critical, but loss and damage makes clear there’s an additional need that requires a response. It’s a need that proponents argue can’t be handled by disaster relief, humanitarian assistance or insurance.

And because it is different, vulnerable countries are asking that the money to address it also be separate and distinct.

3. Where do things stand?

Developing countries put forward a proposal at last year’s climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland, for a financing mechanism for loss and damage.

It didn’t advance, however, because countries such as the United States didn’t support the measure. One concern was that the proposal would make developed countries pay reparations—as opposed to all major emitters, such as China. Another worry was it could open developed countries to legal challenges or endless calls for compensation.

Instead, the agreed upon outcome was a three-year dialogue to hash out how to finance climate damages.

Developing countries have bristled at the prospect of more talk shops and are re-upping their demands to negotiate financing arrangements this year. U.S. officials said that while they’re willing to talk about avenues for loss and damage funding, they won’t yet back a new mechanism and would prefer to look at existing ways of addressing the challenge, including through continued efforts to reduce emissions (Climatewire, Oct. 20).

Climate experts and officials from vulnerable countries say that’s unrealistic because warming has advanced to the point that some climate impacts are already unstoppable (Climatewire, Aug. 9, 2021). And emissions are still rising, despite pledges to move in the other direction. On Monday, more than 140 U.S.-based climate and development organizations sent a letter to U.S. climate envoy John Kerry urging progress on the issue.

Some action is happening outside the U.N. process. Scotland and Denmark have committed around $15 million between them to tackle loss and damage at a global level, and finance ministers from the world’s most climate-vulnerable countries agreed to work with Germany and other wealthy nations to set up a finance and insurance mechanism to address climate risk.

But developing countries and activists argue that a formal loss-and-damage financing mechanism needs to be part of the U.N process to give it legitimacy and account for developing countries’ needs and priorities. The Alliance of Small Island States is seeking agreement among the nearly 200 countries that are parties to the U.N. climate negotiations to set up a new, stand-alone fund for loss and damage before talks start in Egypt.

4. How to put a price on loss and damage

A few studies have attempted to estimate the costs.

One study from 2018 projects that total damages in developing countries could reach between $290 billion and $580 billion by 2030. The African Development Bank Group estimates that the continent loses between 5 and 15 percent of its gross domestic product each year to the impacts of climate change, while a group of 55 climate-vulnerable nations found that they had lost a fifth of their wealth over the past 20 years due to climate-fueled disasters.

Some countries are also starting to price loss and damage into their climate targets. The small Pacific island nation of Vanuatu is calling for nearly $180 million for loss-and-damage compensation and has grounded its new climate targets on support from developing countries (Climatewire, Aug. 23).

What’s important to acknowledge in addressing loss and damage is that it’s seen as additional to other forms of climate and development finance and that it doesn’t take as long as existing financial mechanisms to get set up and start distributing money, said Tom Mitchell, executive director of the International Institute for Environment and Development, a research organization based in London.

In comparison, the U.N.’s Green Climate Fund was created to help developing nations reduce emissions and build resilience to climate impacts. But it can be hard for countries to access, a particular challenge when money is urgently needed. And humanitarian aid has proved inadequate to deal with the scale of the problem.

Without a separate fund, countries may simply redirect development aid toward loss and damage and away from other needs, like poverty reduction and education—something one study shows is already happening with current climate finance pledges (Climatewire, June 23).

5. Why now?

Loss and damage has been a part of the U.N. climate agenda for years. But opposition from the United States and other countries has prevented a robust negotiation on finance from taking off (Climatewire, Nov. 19, 2021).

That’s changing as the impacts become more severe and frustration at the lack of action builds.

Climate-vulnerable country leaders and advocates warn that more talk creates unnecessary delays and that rich countries need to take responsibility for the emissions currently causing the damage, out of a sense of solidarity.

“We know that loss and damage is here. People are suffering. We saw what’s coming from Pakistan, Bangladesh, South Sudan this year, and there are more and more extreme events,” said Madeleine Diouf Sarr, the Senegalese chair of a negotiating group of least-developed countries. “We need to have a global solution,” she added.

Among developing countries, loss and damage is also no longer seen as an issue confined to small island developing states, say finance experts. The proposal to address loss and damage in Glasgow, for instance, was backed by a coalition of 134 developing countries known as the G-77 and by China. That group is currently led by Pakistan, where historic flooding this year has cost more than $30 billion in damages.

Many of the countries in that grouping are also facing high levels of debt distress, and climate is one of the drivers of growing food and water insecurity.

“This whole issue of climate risk and vulnerable countries increasingly having to deal with more frequent and more severe disasters is becoming a bigger domestic and international priority for a lot of countries, even outside of the climate negotiations,” said Taylor Dimsdale, director of risk and resilience at climate think tank E3G.

Failing to reach an agreement on loss-and-damage finance as a part of the formal agenda in Egypt could set the tone for the remainder of the talks, say analysts. It could also reverberate beyond climate negotiations, affecting countries’ willingness to cooperate on a range of issues, among them trade or security.

b3f6d5c6-0096-4629-84f0-bc204b16354a,"EU urges ‘ambitious’ climate targets

LUXEMBOURG

The EU set out its position for the COP27 climate summit on Monday in a text that called for “ambitious targets” but did not put a figure on financial help for developing countries.

The 27 member states acknowledged that “global ambition must increase substantially” to keep Paris Agreement temperature goals within reach.

The text urges countries to “come forward with ambitious targets” ahead of the UN conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt next month.

The EU is ready to update national contributions “as soon as possible” after discussions between the 27 member states to finalise their climate plan, it said.

The plan aims to reduce the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions by 55 percent, compared to 1990 levels, by 2030.

The text, adopted by EU environment ministers meeting in Luxembourg, also “calls on all parties to close the book on unabated coal through a phasedown”.

But the declaration is cautious on the thorny matter of financial help for developing countries.

Financing “loss and damage” caused by the impacts of global warming is set to be a burning issue at COP27, the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

Rich countries have still not kept their commitment to provide at least $100 billion a year in climate aid -- a target initially set for 2020 -- to help poor countries reduce their emissions and adapt.

The EU member states expect “the goal will be met in 2023” the text says, without providing any new target figures.

Compensation for loss and damage is “a tricky question”, said Czech Environment Minister Anna Hubackova, adding: “We are ready to discuss” possible terms.

“Today at the Council, we’ve agreed to have an open mind in the loss and damage negotiations”, said Dutch Energy Minister Rob Jetten.

“We have to recognise the impact on a lot of developing countries”, he added.

“Let’s see in Sharm el-Sheikh where this ends”, he said."

Nairobi: The chair of an influential negotiating bloc in the upcoming United Nations climate summit in Egypt has called for compensation for poorer countries suffering from climate change to be high up on the agenda.

Madeleine Diouf Sarr, who chairs the Least Developed Countries group, told The Associated Press that the November conference - known as COP27 - should ""capture the voice and needs of the most climate-vulnerable nations and deliver climate justice"".

Sarr said the group would like to see ""an agreement to establish a dedicated financial facility"" that pays nations that are already facing the effects of climate change at the summit.

The LDC group, comprised of 46 nations that make up just a small fraction of global emissions, negotiates as a bloc at the UN summit to champion the interests of developing countries. Issues such as who pays for poorer nations to transition to cleaner energy, making sure no communities get left behind in an energy transition and boosting how well vulnerable people can adapt to climate change have long been on the bloc's agenda.

Developing nations still face serious challenges accessing clean energy finance, with Africa attracting just 2% of the total clean energy investment in the last 20 years, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. The UN weather agency recently estimated that global clean energy supplies must double by 2030 for the world to limit global warming within the set targets.

Sarr added that the bloc will push for funds to help developing countries adapt to droughts, floods and other climate-related events as well as urging developed nations to speed up their plans to reduce emissions. The group is particularly vulnerable to climate change because of their lack of ability to adapt to extremes, the UN weather agency said.

""We have delayed climate action for too long,"" Sarr said, pointing to the promised $100 billion a year in climate aid for poorer countries that was pledged over a decade ago.

""We can no longer afford to have a COP that is all talk. The climate crisis has pushed our adaptation limits, resulted in inevitable loss and damage, and delayed our much-needed development,"" added Sarr.

The COP27 President also said this year's summit should be about implementing plans and pledges that countries have agreed to at previous conferences.

Sarr defended the UN conference as ""one of the few spaces where our nations come together to hold countries accountable for historical responsibility"" and pointed to the success of the 2015 conference in Paris in setting the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees C (2.7 F)."

4723193f-29de-4799-893a-8a6357a47e0b,"The destruction of global forests slowed in 2021 but the vital climate goal of ending deforestation by 2030 will still be missed without urgent action, according to an assessment.

The area razed in 2021 fell by 6.3% after progress in some countries, notably Indonesia. But almost 7m hectares were lost and the destruction of the most carbon- and biodiversity-rich tropical rainforests fell by only 3%. The CO 2 emissions resulting from the lost trees were equivalent to the emissions of the entire European Union plus Japan.

Global heating could not be limited to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels without ending deforestation, experts said. At the UN’s Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow last year, 145 countries pledged to end the felling of forests by the end of the decade. The demolition and degradation of forests causes about 10% of global carbon emissions.

However, based on current trends, the Glasgow leaders’ declaration would be as “hollow” as the pledge made by countries in 2014 to end deforestation by 2020, the assessment’s authors said.

There was little clarity or transparency of the measures being taken to end deforestation and only 1% of the required funding was being provided, they said, and most importantly a lack of political will.

Erin Matson at Climate Focus, a policy group and one of the coalition of organisations that conducted the assessment, said: “The [Glasgow declaration] was a big moment, the first time such a target had been embraced at the leaders level by so many countries, covering 90% of global forests.

“But we are not on track. There has been some modest improvement, but even this could just be temporary. Many countries are putting their progress at risk by phasing out or rolling back protections. For example, Indonesia did not renew its palm oil moratorium after it expired in September 2021 and a recently adopted law on job creation poses a serious threat to natural forests.”

The largest area of destroyed forest in 2021 was in Brazil, where deforestation has risen under president Jair Bolsonaro, having fallen under his predecessor, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The election contest between the two men, on 30 October, has been described by scientists as likely to determine the fate of the Amazon. “The stakes are high,” Matson said.

David Gibbs, a research associate at the World Resources Institute’s (WRI) Global Forest Watch, said: “We are quickly moving toward another round of hollow commitments and vanished forests.”

Fran Price, at the World Wildlife Fund, said: “There is no pathway to meeting the 1.5C target or reversing biodiversity loss without halting deforestation and conversion. It is time for bold leadership and daring solutions.”

Four of the top five countries with the largest areas of deforestation – Brazil, Bolivia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Paraguay – increased the destruction in 2021.

However, “exceptional progress” in some countries showed the 2030 goal was still possible, the authors said. Indonesia, the only country to cut deforestation in each of the past five years, and its neighbour Malaysia, reduced forest destruction by about 25% in 2021. As a result, tropical Asia is the only region on track for zero deforestation by 2030.

A drive to end the razing of forests for cocoa plantations in Ivory Coast and Ghana helped deforestation fall by 47% and 13% respectively, while new national parks and measures to fight illegal logging led to a 28% fall in Gabon. Tropical Latin America, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia and Guatemala also reported cuts in deforestation in 2021.

“We have the data and we know what interventions work – the missing element is the political will to actually undertake those actions,” said Frances Seymour at WRI.

The measures include government bans combined with effective enforcement, collaborations with the beef, soy, timber and other commodity companies whose products are most linked to deforestation, international trade measures and the strengthening of the land rights of Indigenous and other local people.

Countries backing the Glasgow declaration pledged to quadruple annual funding to tackle deforestation but no information was yet available on how these pledges would be met, the authors said.

Only a quarter of the biggest global companies in the agriculture sector have announced strong policies to eliminate deforestation from their supply chains and just 20% of these are close to meeting their commitments.

The new forest declaration assessment used data on permanent tree cover loss around the world to create a baseline from 2018-20. To get to zero deforestation by 2030 requires a fall of 10% a year, meaning the current slowing of deforestation is insufficient.

Forest cover has increased in some countries since 2000 but less than the area lost. New forests could not offset the huge carbon storage and biodiversity of existing natural forests, the authors said.

Protecting intact forests had even more climate benefits than just the CO 2 stored, said Seymour, thanks to their role in producing cloud cover that cools the planet. “If we take the non-carbon processes into account, they amplify the cooling effect of ending tropical forest loss by about 50%,” she said.

Michael Wolosin, at Conservation International, said: “That 50% cooling bonus should be included by forest countries in their accounting to gain the recognition and finance they deserve for the services their forests are providing to the world.”"

WASHINGTON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The latest pledges by countries to tackle global warming under the Paris Agreement are ""woefully inadequate"" to avert a rise in global temperatures that scientists say will worsen droughts, storms and floods, a report said on Wednesday.

The 2015 pact launched at a U.N. global climate summit requires 194 countries to detail their plans to fight climate change in what are known as nationally determined contributions, or NDCs.

In pledges made through September, the NDCs would reduce global emissions of greenhouse gases only 7% from 2019 levels by 2030, said the report titled ""The State of NDCs: 2022."" It was written by the World Resources Institute (WRI) global nonprofit research group.

Countries must strengthen their targets by about six times that, or at least 43%, to align with what the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says is enough to reach the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting the global temperature rise by 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees F), it said.

""It really looks like we're hitting a bit of a plateau,"" Taryn Fransen, a senior fellow at WRI and author of the report said in an interview. She added that the COVID-19 pandemic and economic woes may have mostly capped countries' ambitions to boost their NDCs since 2021.

Current NDCs propose to reduce emissions by 5.5 gigatonnes compared with the initial NDCs from 2015, nearly equal to eliminating the annual emissions of the United States. But only 10% of that planned reduction has been pledged since 2021.

On the bright side, Australia and Indonesia did boost their NDCs this year. ""That got us some progress,"" Fransen said, ""but there hasn't been a lot beyond that."" Countries in the Paris Agreement are required to update their NDCs by 2025.

""If the pace of improvement from 2016 to today continues, the world will not only miss the Paris Agreement goals, but it will miss them by a long shot,"" the report said.

Much of the focus of this year's global climate talks, to be held next month in Egypt, will center on reducing emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas far more potent than carbon dioxide during its first 20 years in the atmosphere. In an example of the work yet to be done, WRI found that only 15 of the 119 countries that signed a Global Methane Pledge launched last year included a specific, quantified methane reduction target in their NDCs.

Fransen said economic and health benefits of reducing emissions, such as the build-out of the energy transition and reduced air pollution, can help build momentum to deeper cuts. ""Seeing those benefits can only help drive more ambitions, but it is a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem,"" she said.

The Forest Declaration Assessment, published on Monday, provides a comprehensive glimpse at global forest health one year after more than 140 countries representing 90% of the world’s forests committed to ending deforestation by 2030.

“In order to meet the 2030 zero deforestation target, we would need to see a 10% reduction in global deforestation every year from 2021 to 2030,” Erin Matson, a senior consultant at Climate Focus, one of the organizations that conducts the annual report, told reporters during a press call. “In 2021, deforestation reduced by 6.3% — a good start, but not on track with a 10% trajectory.”

“The picture is not yet rosy,” she added.

The deforestation pact at last year’s United Nations climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland, was widely celebrated, despite plenty of reasons to be skeptical that it would lead to meaningful change. In 2014, dozens of nations signed on to the New York Declaration on Forests, setting a goal of cutting deforestation in half by 2020 and ending it altogether by 2030. That pledge did little to slow forest destruction.

One year after COP26 in Scotland, the world is already digging itself into another hole. Globally, 6.8 million hectares of forest — an area roughly the size of Ireland — were lost in 2021, according to the report. In the tropics, intact primary forests decreased 3.1%.

“We are quickly moving toward another round of hollow commitments and vanished forests,” David Gibbs, a research associate at the World Resources Institute’s Global Forest Watch, said in a statement accompanying the release of the Forest Declaration Assessment.

The report, formally known as the New York Declaration on Forests Progress Assessment, used deforestation data from 2018 to 2020 to establish a baseline for comparison.

One of the biggest hurdles to reining in forest loss is a severe lack of investment. Protecting and restoring forest ecosystems on a global scale is estimated to cost up to $460 billion annually. According to the report, an average $2.3 billion is being spent each year — less than 1% of what is needed.

“The COP26 finance pledges altogether could increase that amount by up to four times, to 9.5 billion U.S. dollars per year,” but details remain scarce, Matson said. “That would still only be a fraction of the finance needed.”

As part of the COP26 initiative, President Joe Biden pledged up to $9 billion through 2030 to fight deforestation around the globe; however, that funding still must get approval from Congress.

“Preserving forests and other ecosystems can and should play an important role in meeting our ambitious climate goals as part of the net-zero emissions strategy we all have,” Biden said at last year’s summit. “The United States is going to lead by our example at home and support other forested nations and developing countries in setting and achieving ambitious action to conserve and restore these carbon sinks.”

Forest-rich nations that signed on to last year’s pledge included Brazil, China, Colombia, Congo, Indonesia and Russia. John Kerry, the Biden administration’s special climate envoy, publicly applauded Brazil for its new commitments at the summit, including to end illegal deforestation by 2028 — two years ahead of schedule.

But as experts told HuffPost at the time, there was little reason to take Brazil’s deforestation pledge seriously. Monday’s report highlights that the South American nation continues to move in the wrong direction under far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, a climate change denier who has overseen record deforestation in the Amazon rainforest.

“We are quickly moving toward another round of hollow commitments and vanished forests.” - David Gibbs, research associate at the World Resources Institute’s Global Forest Watch

Brazil continues to be the planet’s largest contributor to deforestation, tallying a 3% increase in the rate of deforestation last year, according to the assessment.

“That is a country where we have seen that when solutions are put into place — where there are strong government mandates, private sector action, full society engagement — there can be a significant reduction in deforestation,” said Matson, noting the declines in deforestation in Brazil between 2004 and 2012. “Obviously, since then, that progress has been significantly rolled back and reversed.”

Deforestation rates also ticked up in Bolivia, Paraguay and the Democratic Republic of Congo last year.

The report is not without its bright spots. Tropical Asia stands alone as the only region that is on pace to meet the 2030 target, the assessment found. That’s in large part because of progress in Indonesia, the only nation to reduce deforestation rates each of the last five years, and Malaysia. In Africa, Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire decreased deforestation 13% and 47% in 2021, respectively, through a concerted effort to boost sustainability within the cocoa trade.

The problem with falling behind on the latest deforestation target this early is that the difference will have to be made up, Matson said. And 2030 is only eight years away.

“It becomes harder every year to reach that gross deforestation reduction goal for every year that we don’t do it,” Matson said. “Our report recommends that governments should take much more forceful action to regulate private sector actors, to level the playing field.”"

2022 Survey Reiterates That the Better a Company Measures Its Emissions, the More it Can Reduce Them—and Reduction Comes with Significant Financial Benefits

The Time Has Come to Accelerate: More Leadership Support, Better Policy Incentives, and Adoption of Digital Solutions Are Required

BOSTON, Oct. 20, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The call for global climate action today is urgent, and companies recognize the need to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions—not just for the planet, but for the benefit of their own business. And while accurately and comprehensively measuring emissions is crucial for identifying ways to reduce them, measurement remains a major roadblock—particularly for scope 3 (external) emissions. These are among the findings of the 2022 CO2 AI by BCG Carbon Emissions Survey being released today by Boston Consulting Group (BCG).

The survey continues and builds on the initial 2021 investigation into the progress that organizations around the world have made in measuring and reducing their carbon emissions. And while some progress has been made in the past year, it has been slow overall across industries and regions, with only 10% of companies measuring their emissions comprehensively (scope 1, 2, and 3) in 2022 vs. 9% in 2021. In addition, respondents estimate a 25% to 30% average error rate in their emissions measurements. And, while 92% of all emissions are external (scope 3) according to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), only 12% of organizations surveyed consider scope 3 their top priority.

""These measurements are crucial to helping companies work towards their net-zero goals,"" said Charlotte Degot, founder and global leader of CO2 AI by BCG. ""And they need be supported by digital tools that help them achieve accuracy and comprehensiveness, which helps decision making for reduction.""

Reducing Emissions Adds Significant Benefits

The slow progress is notable, since this year's edition reinforces the fact that the better a company measures its emissions, the more effectively it can reduce them—64% of respondents who measure the full scope of their emissions and 45% who partially measure them noted a significant reduction in those emissions. In terms of monetary value, more than 70% of respondents foresee at least $1 million in annual benefits from emissions reduction, with 37% calculating benefits as high as $100 million or more. Businesses report many additional benefits as well, with 54% noting an improved reputation, and 37% calling out the ability to attract top talent as pluses.

BCG surveyed more than 1,600 organizations, each with 1,000 employees or more and revenues ranging from approximately $100 million to over $10 billion—across 14 major industries and 18 countries. These organizations are, in aggregate, responsible for over 40% of global emissions.

Digital Solutions Are Required

Respondents believe more leadership support, better policy incentives (e.g., regulation, tax incentives) and adoption of digital solutions are required to accelerate emissions measurement and reduction. On the digital front in particular, organizations with automated solutions for emissions measurement, such as CO2 AI are 2.2 times more likely to measure emissions comprehensively and 1.9 times more likely to reduce emissions in line with their ambitions.

""The results of this year's survey tell a clear story—the time has come to urgently accelerate progress in terms of the measurement and reduction of emissions,"" said Hubertus Meinecke, global leader of BCG's Climate & Sustainability practice. ""Leaders need to demonstrate true convictions and a willingness to drive cultural changes—at both the company and governmental level, and organizations need to embrace the adoption of the digital and AI tools that are available to provide them with the most accurate and comprehensive measurement.""

More than a dozen groups that track what policies insurers have on high-emissions activities say the industry is turning its back on oil, gas and coal.

The alliance, Insure Our Future, said Wednesday that 62% of reinsurance companies — which help other insurers spread their risks — have plans to stop covering coal projects, while 38% are now excluding some oil and natural gas projects.

In part, investors are demanding it. But insurers have also begun to make the link between fossil fuel infrastructure, such as mines and pipelines, and the impact that greenhouse gas emissions are having on other parts of their business.

This includes extreme weather events such as hurricanes, which are forecast to become more potent with global warming. Hurricane Ian recently caused tens of billions of dollars in damage in the United States.

Earlier this month Munich Re, one of the world’s biggest reinsurers, said it would stop backing new oil and gas fields beginning next April.

“Insurance is the Achilles heel of the fossil fuel industry and has the power to accelerate the transition to clean energy,” said Peter Bosshard, the report’s author.

That’s because projects that require large amounts of capital are unlikely to attract investment if they can’t get insurance to cover potentially costly mishaps.

Insure Our Future said its annual scorecard of 30 companies ranked Allianz, AXA and Axis Capital best for their coal exit policies, while Aviva, Hannover Re and Munich Re came out on top for oil and natural gas.

By contrast, some insurers such as Berkshire Hathaway, Starr and Everest Re have adopted few or no restrictions coal, oil or gas projects, it said. The alliance also criticized Lloyd’s of London for announcing plans for ending coal coverage two years ago but then declaring it optional.

Many of the insurers reviewed introduced their restrictions in the last year, though the exact policies differ significantly, the report said.

Some countries have meanwhile proposed applying the idea of insurance to help countries facing massive costs due to climate change.

Germany, which chairs the Group of Seven leading economies, and the V20 alliance of vulnerable nations, chaired by Ghana, last week agreed to promote the idea of a “global shield” against climate risks.

In some insurance markets, such as Florida, people are already struggling to get coverage for hurricanes and other disasters that are forecast to become more potent with global warming.

“If climate change continues at its current rate, markets where they can provide insurance at a rate people can afford will erode,” said Thistlethwaite.

d2a998ae-a67e-4fe5-be7d-7bef9c446f8a,"The UK has joined calls for sweeping reforms to the World Bank, to focus much-needed funding on the climate crisis, saying that its current structures are not working.

The intervention from Alok Sharma, the current president of the UN climate talks, heaps further pressure on beleaguered World Bank chief, David Malpass. He has faced calls to resign over an apparently climate-dismissing stance, and the Bank’s perceived failures to deliver climate finance.

Germany led calls earlier in the week for fundamental reform, and the US treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, spoke out on Thursday. These public calls for an overhaul mark a significant intervention from governments, which usually keep disagreements with the Bank behind closed doors.

Sharma, the UK cabinet minster and chair of the Cop26 UN climate summit, told an audience in Washington DC on Friday afternoon: “The world is recognising that we cannot tackle the defining challenge of this century [the climate emergency] with institutions defined by the last. We have to incentivise every aspect of the international system to recognise the systemic risk of climate change, and to make managing it effectively its central task.”

Sharma, who will hold the presidency of the climate talks until Egypt takes over at the Cop27 UN climate summit next month, added: “Climate must be at the very heart of what [the World Bank and other development banks] do, and they must do more to lead on this agenda. The world cannot afford for such institutions to be cautious in how their considerable climate resources are deployed. That is a matter of social justice as well as environmental security.”

The World Bank held its annual meetings this week, which were hit by protests from climate campaigners accusing the bank of failing to deliver climate finance to the poorest countries.

Developing countries have been increasingly frustrated by the lack of funding for them to adapt to the impacts of the climate crisis, the fact that a large proportion currently goes to middle-income countries who can already access private sector cash, and that most of the funding to the poorest comes in the form of loans that can drive them further into debt.

Mia Mottley, prime minister of Barbados, called at the UN general assembly last month for an “overhaul” of the World Bank and its sister institutions, to tackle the climate emergency. She met the US vice-president, Kamala Harris, to make her case, and has gathered a loose coalition of developing countries to her cause.

Shauna Aminath, minister of environment for the Maldives, told the Guardian her government had received no help from any of the development banks to adapt the impacts of the climate crisis, despite being a frontline country. “It’s very frustrating,” she said.

“The World Bank needs a fundamental shift in how this is addressed. Finance is not going to the countries that need it most,” she said.

While the UK, US and Germany stopped short of calling for the resignation of Malpass, the Guardian understands that discussions are ongoing among some of the World Bank’s biggest funder countries over his future. If enough governments want him gone, it will be hard for him to resist pressure.

Malpass was chosen by US president Donald Trump in April 2019, following the longstanding convention by which the appointment is in the gift of the White House. But his stance on the climate has long been under question, and last month he caused uproar by refusing to affirm climate science when confronted by a New York Times journalist on the fringes of the UN general assembly in New York.

Al Gore, a former US vice-president, called Malpass a “climate denier”, and the White House condemned Malpass’s remarks, for which he subsequently issued a clarification. With major countries openly backing fundamental reform at the Bank, Malpass’s future looks increasingly in doubt.

Criticism of the Bank by developing countries is likely to intensify at the Cop27 UN climate summit in Egypt next month, where climate finance will be a key theme.

A spokesperson for the World Bank said: “The World Bank Group has long recognised man-made climate change as one of the defining issues of our age, and we’ve been rapidly scaling up our financing to help countries adapt to, and mitigate the risks from, our changing climate. Climate change could push up to 132 million people into poverty by 2030.”

The spokesperson pointed to the group’s $31.7bn (£28.3bn) of climate finance in 2021, and a new initiative for grant payments to developing countries that reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.

“We support the rights of people to engage in peaceful protest, and we share the concerns of climate activists that all countries and organisations need to take more action to confront the climate crisis,” the spokesperson said."

Summary World Bank needs leader that understands climate science

Financial institutions could help tackle 'loss and damage'

EU supports loss and damage item on COP27 agenda















BERLIN, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Germany's climate envoy in an interview said that global financial institutions need a revamp to better fight climate change, which requires leaders who understand the science, amid a fray over the views of World Bank chief David Malpass.

The comments by Jennifer Morgan, who led Greenpeace International before joining Germany's Greens-run foreign ministry, come after Malpass last month declined to say he supported the scientific consensus on climate change.

Malpass later apologised and defended the World Bank's commitment to tackling climate change, but many civil society groups are pushing for his replacement at the helm of the bank before his term expires in April 2024.

""The whole international financial institutions that came to be after the Second World War, the Bretton Woods institutions, now are being discussed in a way that could revamp them for today's problems,"" the U.S.-born Morgan, Germany's first special envoy for international climate action, told Reuters. ""And we need good leadership for that.""

Britain's climate envoy, Alok Sharma, also sought reform of global financial institutions on Friday.

“The world is recognising that we cannot tackle the defining challenge of this century with institutions defined by the last,"" Sharma said in an address to the Wilson Center think tank in Washington. ""We have to incentivise every aspect of the international system to recognise the systemic risk of climate change, and to make managing it effectively its central task.”

Financial institutions could help tackle the sensitive issue of compensation for economic losses and damages due to climate-induced extreme weather events, Morgan said.

Morgan, together with Chile's environment minister, Maisa Rojas, is in charge of coming up with a plan for how to include ""loss and damage"" on the formal agenda of the upcoming COP27 climate negotiations in Egypt Nov. 6-18.

The issue is contentious, as lower-income and climate-vulnerable countries are seeking concrete answers while industrialised nations are wary of creating a fund because of the liabilities they may face.

""Germany, the European Union - we very much support an agenda item (on this),"" said Morgan, noting that countries still needed to hammer out some details. ""But I think no one wants an agenda fight at the beginning of this COP.""

Germany itself was leading a G7 initiative to create a ""global shield against climate risks"" to help communities in vulnerable countries recover faster from disasters, she said. This would tailor support to countries and match them with finance, insurance and technical mechanisms.

Germany is also open to negotiating a deal on loss and damages within the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, she said.

Asked about Russia's potential role at COP27, she said a Russian representative had attended the pre-COP talks in Kinshasa last week, which ran smoothly.

""They're a party just like any other party,"" she said. ""We have to show that we can move forward together. So we'll see what they do at the COP.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Standard setters must work faster to avoid hardwiring differences between their finalised climate-related company disclosures, which would fragment markets, the G20's Financial Stability Board (FSB) said on Tuesday.

To help meet net-zero carbon emission targets, companies face mandatory rules on telling investors how climate change will affect their bottom line.

The International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) is working on a set of global ""baseline"" norms it plans to finalise by early 2023 for use in countries like Britain.

The European Union is aiming finalising its own, more comprehensive set of disclosures for 50,000 companies by next month. They go further than the ISSB by including detailed coverage of a company's impact on the environment, and also covering social and governance issues with bespoke norms.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has also proposed climate-related disclosures.

Klaas Knot, the Dutch central bank president who chairs the FSB, said developing the disclosures provides a unique opportunity to avoid ""harmful fragmentation"" in markets so that users can compare companies from across the world.

""Interoperability between the common global baseline and national and regional jurisdiction-specific requirements will be essential,"" Knot said in a letter to G20 finance ministers meeting in Washington this week.

""This needs to be built in early on, and certainly before frameworks are finalised and become hard to adjust.""

The FSB echoed calls from the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

The new disclosure rules will replace a patchwork of practices which have made it hard for investors to compare companies, but business groups say terminology needs aligning.

The FSB said further work will be needed to achieve interoperability given that differences in approaches and pace of progress across jurisdictions remain, the FSB said.

57903028-b9b0-4497-b914-527b7edeedef,"More companies are disclosing financial information related to climate change this year, but the disclosures are falling short of recommendations from regulators.

The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures released its 2022 status report Thursday, showing a steady increase in the percentage of companies disclosing TCFD-aligned information since 2017, along with the amount of information they disclose. The TCFD, which was established in late 2015 by the Financial Stability Board, an international group of financial regulators, published its final recommendations in 2017 and has been tracking disclosures in line with those recommendations every year since then, reviewing the publicly available reports of over 1,400 companies from eight industries and five regions of the world about climate-related financial disclosure practices.

The report found the average number of recommended disclosures addressed per company has steadily increased each year for the past five years — from 1.4 in 2017 fiscal year reporting to 4.2 in 2021 fiscal year reporting. Despite these improvements, their efforts are not enough: While 80% of companies disclosed in line with at least one of the TCFD-recommended disclosures for fiscal year 2021, only 43% disclosed in line with at least five. Those levels of disclosure fall short of the TCFD's 11 recommended disclosures.

However, there was positive news in the improving disclosures. On average across the 11 recommended disclosures, the percentage of companies disclosing TCFD-aligned information increased by 26 percentage points between 2017 and 2021. On top of that, over 60% of the companies reviewed disclosed their climate-related risks or opportunities in 2021 fiscal year reports, up from 27% in 2017 fiscal year reports.

There has also been steady growth in climate-related financial disclosures on an industry and regional basis over the past three years. Of the eight industries reviewed by the TCFD, four had average disclosure levels across the 11 recommended disclosures of more than 40% — energy companies at 43%, materials and buildings companies at 42%, banks at 41%, and insurance companies at 41%. The biggest increase between 2019 and 2021 reporting was for banks at 20 percentage points. The increase for materials and buildings and insurance companies was 16 percentage points and 10 percentage points for energy companies.

On a regional basis, European companies reviewed disclosed at 60% on average across the 11 recommended disclosures for 2021 reporting, growing 23 percentage points since 2019. In North America, the average level of disclosure for companies reviewed was 29% for fiscal year 2021 reporting, growing 12 percentage points since 2019. Notably, over 60% of North American companies disclosed climate-related risks or opportunities and 45% disclosed their impacts.

Over half of companies in the Asia Pacific region disclosed climate-related metrics, although the region averaged 36% reporting across all 11 recommended disclosures — an increase of 11 percentage points since 2017. The average level of disclosure by companies in Latin America and the Middle East and Africa increased nine percentage points each since 2019, bringing the average levels of disclosure to 28% and 25%, respectively.

Continuing growth in investor demand for companies to report TCFD-aligned information and use of the TCFD recommendations by governments, regulators, and standard-setters in developing climate-related disclosure requirements are likely helping to drive the increase in TCFD-aligned reporting.

As of today, over 3,900 organizations have now pledged their support for the TCFD, growing from over 2,600 supporters when the Task Force released its 2021 status report. TCFD supporters span 101 countries and jurisdictions, covering nearly all sectors of the economy, with a combined market capitalization of $26 trillion.

The TCFD has also garnered support from the world's largest public companies. Of the 100 largest public companies, 92 either support the TCFD, report in line with the TCFD recommendations, or both — up from 83 last year.

""The 2022 TCFD Report underscores the increasing adoption of climate-related financial disclosures since the Task Force's 2017 recommendations - as well as the urgent need for greater progress on this front and in the global fight against climate change,"" said TCFD chair Michael Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg LP and former mayor of New York City, in a statement. ""Climate risks are also financial risks, and more measurement and disclosure are crucial to building a more sustainable and resilient economy and a safer future.""

Over the next several months, the TCFD intends to continue to monitor companies' progress in disclosing climate-related financial information aligned with the TCFD recommendations and will prepare another status report, as requested by the FSB, in October 2023.

""These findings demonstrate that the TCFD framework has become essential in guiding companies as they analyze how climate risks and opportunities impact their financial position,"" said former Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Mary Schapiro, head of the TCFD secretariat and vice chair for global public policy at Bloomberg LP, in a statement. ""While we are proud of the progress we've seen since 2017 in company disclosures, and in adoption of TCFD by governments, standard-setters and regulators, these findings make it clear there is more work to be done to improve transparency as companies and investors assess their risks through the lens of climate change.""

Since the publication of the TCFD's 2021 status report, regulators and international standard-setters have taken steps to use the TCFD recommendations in developing climate-related reporting requirements and standards, the report pointed out, including proposals released earlier this year by the SEC, as well as the International Sustainability Standards Board and the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group.

""This year's report further demonstrates that the TCFD recommendations are providing the common basis for firms' climate-related disclosures around the world,"" said the FSB's chair, Klaas Knot, in a statement. ""They provide a strong foundation for the planned new ISSB global baseline standard. I'm therefore pleased to see the robust increase in climate-related disclosures using the TCFD framework, which will encourage greater clarity and consistency across firms."""

LONDON (Reuters) - More companies provided climate-related financial data to investors during 2021 but urgent progress is still needed, the G20's Taskforce on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) said on Thursday.

Regulators view comprehensive and rigorous disclosures as key to helping economies meet net zero targets, while stamping out ""greenwashing"" and preventing companies from playing down the impact of climate change on their bottom line.

Set up by the G20's Financial Stability Board (FSB), the industry-led TCFD set out recommendations in 2017 on how companies could voluntarily disclose the risks and opportunities from climate change.

More countries are making climate disclosures mandatory, some based on TCFD recommendations, which in turn are due to be superceded by norms from the new International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) in 2023.

The TCFD said in its annual update on Thursday that reports from 1,400 companies showed they were applying an average of 4.2 of the task force's 11 recommended disclosures, with only 43% of firms appying at least five of them.

Only 4% of firms made disclosures with all ll TCFD recommendations.

""The percent of companies disclosing TCFD-aligned information continues to grow, but more urgent progress is needed,"" the TCFD said in an annual update.

The disclosures include whether or not the board has oversight of the company's plan to lower its planet-harming carbon emissions, whether firm targets have been set, and the plan's integration into the company's risk management process.

ISSB disclosures will replace TCFD in countries such as Britain, but the European Union and the United States are working on their own mandatory climate disclosures for companies.

Earlier this week, the FSB called on the standard setters to ensure ""interoperability"" between their norms to avoid fragmenting international investment markets.

Regulators are now working on the next step: rules for independent audits of climate-related disclosures.

But while viewers have been fascinated by the natural world explored on the show, some scenes were a little bit too natural and hard for viewers to stomach.

The latest instalment saw snowy owls using an open tundra to breed, with one pair having raised a nest full of fluffy chicks.

With 24-hour daylight in which to hunt, the dedicated parents bring back meal after meal for their ever-growing brood.

But one day, they return to find the nest empty - and the root cause behind their absence was played out on screen to cowering viewers.

And viewers soon took to Twitter in their droves to air their dismay at the ""brutal"" scenes.

Alongside an array of sad-faced emojis, one person penned: ""Anxious about work tomorrow? Watch this cute baby animal get eaten alive to an emotive soundtrack. Why do I watch Frozen Planet? Why?""

Echoing their comments, someone else said: ""Nah, that baby bird getting eaten was too much for me to handle.""

Many disgraced fans were even put off their food as they admitted they could no longer bare to eat after seeing the unpleasant scenes.

The latest series of the show comes 11 years after the original in 2011 and follows the originators of the Attenborough franchise, Planet Earth and Blue Planet.

When it rains, it pours. A paper published Tuesday in the journal Geophysical Research Letters finds that it’s raining harder in most of the United States. The study, written by researchers at Northwestern University, tied the results to climate change and to warmer air’s ability to hold more water. 10 steps you can take to lower your carbon footprint ArrowRight Record rain is hitting drought-stricken areas. That’s not good news. The findings echo the fundamental laws of physics and thermodynamics, as well as the evidence from decades of research, and highlight the real-time effect that humans are having on the weather and climate.

The research offers confirmation of what atmospheric scientists have been warning of for years: a warmer world is, on balance, a wetter world. And as global temperatures continue to rise, an uptick in precipitation extremes is expected.

Climate change is causing heavier rains

What the study finds is consistent with a basic tenet of atmospheric physics: For every degree Fahrenheit that air temperature rises, the atmosphere can hold 4 percent more water; this is known as the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship. Where storm clouds develop and the atmosphere is sufficiently moist, it means a warmer climate will support more intense rainfall.

The study reports “consistent shifts from lower to higher daily precipitation intensities, particularly in the central and eastern United States.” The authors compared rainfall over two periods — 1951 to 1980 and 1991 to 2020 — to see how patterns evolved.

“When it’s raining, it’s raining more,” said Ryan Harp, the author lead author on the study, in an interview. “But what we also did was … we were able to verify some of the expectations we had based on modeling studies.”

In other words, most similar studies to date had centered on projections made by forward-running computer models fed with historical data. This is among the first that, on a nationwide level, examine observed daily rainfall trends.

“I think during that process we were a little surprised that this paper hasn’t been written before,” said Daniel Horton, a study co-author and a professor at Northwestern University, in an interview. “We know that precipitation should be increasing … but we just wanted to do a very straightforward paper that says, ‘Yep, we’re seeing it.’ ”

Harp said the fact that reality matched simulations lends credence to climate models.

“People should in general be trusting in climate models,” he said. “We’re constantly working to improve them to the best of our abilities.”

Not necessarily more rain overall, and not everywhere

In the study, the authors examined daily data from more than 1,700 weather stations distributed in the Lower 48. Each had to have a continuous record dating back to at least 1951 to be included in the study.

In the eastern United States, the researchers observed a 4.5 to 5.7 percent increase in average daily rainfall on days when it rained. That does not say there are more days with rain, or more rain overall.

“That doesn’t necessarily give us the whole story,” Harp said. “There may be places where precipitation intensity is increasing but frequency is decreasing. We might not know if there’s an overall increase or decrease. That’s one thing that we’re working on.”

Greg Carbin, the head of forecast operations at the National Weather Service Weather Prediction Center, who was not involved in this research, appreciated that the study touched on the “paradox of potentially fewer precipitation days with higher-intensity precipitation occurring on those days.”

Carbin has noted a trend of more rain falling on fewer days in his analysis of recent precipitation.

“Overall, the area covered by the count of 1-inch rainfall days was lower than in recent years across large parts of the central and eastern U.S.,” Carbin wrote in an email. “In fact, moderate to severe drought has plagued areas of the Northeast, and extreme to exceptional drought is now expanding across part of the central U.S. Nonetheless, we have had extreme rainfall events occur in St. Louis, Dallas, eastern Kentucky, and, most recently, with Hurricane Ian in Florida.”

Despite strong trends in the central and eastern United States, the authors noted that there were a few places where rainfall did not appear to be growing more intense. The paper does detail “mixed signals in the western U.S.,” but for reasons the authors are still trying to identify.

“That [trend] didn’t hold true for the western U.S.,” said Harp, especially in the Pacific Northwest. He explained that changes in the overall placement of weather systems are “suppressing” any tendency for heavier precipitation in the West. A slight change in the location at which high and low pressure systems are anchored can have an enormous bearing on steering currents, and subsequently on how much precipitation falls in a given location.

Changing precipitation trends poses societal challenges

With the planet continuing to warm, a continued increase in rainfall intensity can be expected. That spells concern over whether existing infrastructure can handle the downpours of the future.

Communities may need to turn to simulated precipitation events of the future to guide building decisions, Horton said.

The past summer was a testament to the extent to which climate-supercharged downpours can wreak havoc on major metropolitan areas. During a five-week span in July and August, five 1,000-year rain events — or extremely heavy rainfall episodes that have a 0.1 percent chance of happening in any given year — occurred across the nation.

“Recent years have seen some remarkable high-end precipitation events,” Carbin said.

f231e1d5-2bef-446d-8cf4-4541f71453c1,"It’s raining harder across most of the U.S. and climate change is to blame, new research has found.

A new paper published in Geophysical Research Letters has found that the country is seeing heavier rainfall as the climate changes. Researchers at Northwestern University connected their findings to the fact that as the planet becomes warmer, air begins to hold more moisture, the Washington Post reported.

In the past, scientists have used something called the Clausius-Clapeyron relation as a way to measure how much more rain is likely as the planet becomes warmer. This equation holds that for every degree Celsius (1.8 Fahrenheit) warmer the air becomes, it can hold on to about 7% more moisture.

In the study, the researchers compared historical precipitation data of two time periods—between 1951-1980 and 1991-2020—within 17 different climate regions in the U.S. This helped the Northwestern researchers conclude that precipitation intensity for both rain and snow had increased for most of the country since the middle of last century, but especially throughout the Midwest, southern states, and the East Coast, according to Northwestern Now.

Researchers couldn’t detect changes in precipitation for areas out West, including areas like the West Coast or the Rocky Mountains, but did conclude that when it rains east of the Rocky Mountains, there is about 5% more rain in the 1991-2020 period, compared to the earlier period.

The researchers pointed out that tracking how climate change is shifting regular weather patterns could also help us understand extreme weather as well. “When people study how climate change has affected weather, they often look at extreme weather events like floods, heatwaves and droughts,” Daniel Horton, the study’s senior author, told Northwestern News. “For this particular study, we wanted to look at the non-extreme events, which are, by definition, much more common. What we found is pretty simple: When it rains now, it rains more.”

More rain, even if it isn’t a lot more, can increase the likelihood of flooding throughout the country. This is only made worse by rising sea levels. And heavier rains also increase the likelihood of landslides—a study published earlier this year predicted more instances of these for the U.S. as well.

The U.S. has experienced several “thousand-year rainfall” events this summer alone. This includes heavy rainfall that caused widespread flooding throughout Saint Louis and Kentucky this past July. Warming temperatures have also been connected to hurricanes dropping more rain as they move north."

Area numbers where extreme ocean warming events are identified are shown with area-averaged values and anomalies relative to 1991-2020.

In the past decade, the marginal seas of Japan frequently experienced extremely high sea surface temperatures (SSTs). A new study led by National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES) researchers revealed that the increased occurrence frequency of extreme ocean warming events since the 2000s is attributable to global warming due to industrialization.

In August 2020, the southern area of Japan and the northwestern Pacific Ocean experienced unprecedentedly high SSTs, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). A recent study published in January 2021 revealed that the record-high northwestern Pacific SST observed in August 2020 could not be expected to occur without human-induced climate changes.

Since then, the JMA again announced that the record high SSTs were observed near Japan in July and October 2021 and from June to August 2022, but it remains unclear to what extent climate change has altered the occurrence likelihood of these regional extreme warming events.

""Impacts of global warming is not uniform, rather show regional and seasonal differences,"" said a co-author Hideo Shiogama, the head of the Earth System Risk Assessment Section at Earth System Division, NIES.

""A comprehensive analysis on regional SSTs for a long period may provide a quantitative understanding of how much ocean condition near Japan has been and will be affected by global warming. This better informs policymakers to plan climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies.""

The paper published in Geophysical Research Letters today figures out the contribution of global warming to discrete monthly extreme ocean warming events in Japan's marginal seas, which could occur less than once per 20 years in the preindustrial era. A climate research group at NIES focused on ten monitoring areas operationally used by the JMA, including the Japan Sea, East China Sea, Okinawa Islands, east of Taiwan, and the Pacific coasts of Japan.

The scientists confirmed that observed SST changes from 1982 to 2021 were well reproduced by 24 climate models participating in the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), except for the region east of Hokkaido. Then, the extreme ocean warming events were identified in nine monitoring areas to reveal the contribution of climate change therein.

Extreme ocean warming and climate change

""In the present climate, every extreme ocean warming event is linked to global warming,"" said corresponding lead author Michiya Hayashi, a research associate at NIES. The scientists estimated the occurrence frequencies of each event in the present and preindustrial climate conditions from January 1982 through July 2022 based on the CMIP6 climate models.

""We found that the occurrence probability of almost all the extreme ocean warming events has already at least doubled since the 2000s than the preindustrial era. It is increased more than tenfold in sizeable cases since the mid-2010s, especially in southern Japan.""

For instance, in July 2022, anomalously high SSTs observed in five monitoring areas, including the Japan Sea (Areas 1, 3), East China Sea (Areas 5, 8), and south of Okinawa near Taiwan (Area 10), are identified as the extreme ocean warming events.

The updated results based on the preliminary data retrieved from the NEAR-GOOS RRTDB website on 15 September 2022 (not included in the published paper) show that, in August 2022, the events are also identified in six monitoring areas at the south of 35°N: the East China Sea (Areas 5, 8), south and east of Okinawa (Areas 10, 9), southeastern Kanto (Area 7), and seas off Shikoku and Tokai (Area 6).

""We estimate that, in all of these identified events in July and August 2022, the occurrence frequencies are increased at least doubled due to climate change, and more than tenfold for those in the south of 35°N except for the north of East China Sea,"" stated Hayashi.

""Climate change impacts on extreme ocean warming events in northern Japan began to emerge relatively late compared to southern Japan,"" noted Shiogama.

The increased global aerosol emissions until the 1980s tend to cool the Earth's surface, which is more substantial in the North Pacific especially near northern Japan via atmospheric large-scale circulation changes. In addition, the year-to-year natural variability of SST is large in northern Japan so the global warming signal was less detectable than in southern Japan.

Since in the last decades global aerosol emissions have been reduced, the cooling effect becomes less dominant to human-induced greenhouse gas warming. ""Our study indicates,"" continued Shiogama, ""that the contribution of climate change to SST extremes has been already discernible beyond natural variability even in northern Japan under the present climate condition.""

What about the ocean conditions expected in the future? The researchers further compared the probabilities of exceeding the monthly record high SSTs around Japan at different global warming levels from 0°C to 2°C using the 24 CMIP6 climate model outputs from 1901 to 2100.

""Once global warming reaches 2°C, all of nine monitoring areas are expected to experience SSTs warmer than the past highest levels at least every two years,"" said Tomoo Ogura, a co-author and the head of the Climate Modeling and Analysis Section at Earth System Division, NIES. He added, ""Limiting global warming below 1.5°C is necessary not to have the record warm conditions in Japan's marginal seas as the new normal climate.""

The quantitative analysis of SSTs around Japan implies that climate change has already become the major factor for most of the record high SSTs in recent years. ""In the future, dynamics of each extreme warming event need to be examined by taking the long-term climate change and year-to-year natural variability into account,"" noted Hayashi.

""Nevertheless, we expect that our statistical results based on the latest climate models will help to implement adaptation and mitigation measures for climate change.""

92a44664-60ec-47e8-a25a-89cdfcd94fdf,"To state the (painfully) obvious: The fates of agriculture and climate change are inextricably linked.

The weather dictates what grows where and when, but as the Earth warms beneath a wool blanket of excess carbon, agriculture is especially vulnerable in ways you might not expect.

Record-setting heat and droughts fry grasses that farmers depend on to feed cattle, warmer temperatures are a boon for pests and fungi that harm crops, smoke from wildfires taint harvests, and extreme weather and rising seas make it more difficult to move everything (including food) around. The threats to food security and livelihoods go on and on.

Undoubtedly, this has some deal-makers in tech salivating. As startups look for ways to adapt the global food system to the chaos of today, we reached out to seven agtech investors to get a better understanding of how the climate crisis has informed their strategies to date.

“Climate challenges are not new to anybody operating in the broader food and agriculture space, so our approach is to invest in solutions that can help mitigate and adapt to climate change,” Yield Lab partner Camila Petignat told TechCrunch.

Themes the firm looks at “include soil and water conservation, improved use of crop inputs, the shift from chemical to biological crop protection solutions and reduction of food waste,” Petignat said.

“We could argue,” Petignat added, “that the increased awareness of carbon markets in recent years has triggered new opportunities at the intersection of agtech and fintech, a space that we are interested in.""

""India is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change,” Omnivore managing partner Jinesh Shah told TechCrunch. “Agriculture represents 20% of India's GHG emissions, but the sector is also incredibly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, which may begin to threaten Indian food security in the coming decade.” he said. Agriculture is responsible for about a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions, per the EPA.

Shah added that the firm's strategy is to ""invest in startups that align with one or more of our four key pillars — increasing smallholder profitability, enhancing smallholder resilience, improving agricultural sustainability and catalyzing climate action.” The investor went on to state that agtech in India must “evolve beyond digital technologies (farmer platforms and B2B marketplaces), and we look to agrifood life sciences for long-term solutions to climate change.”

c1507000-3077-4044-83c5-86cc85f831ce,"Climate change and geopolitical instability are wreaking havoc on agriculture. To gauge how VCs are responding to these issues, we spoke with seven investors.

For starters, rising greenhouse gas emissions are driving punishing droughts and storms, which are harming crops, exacerbating food insecurity and threatening countless livelihoods. At the same time, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is rattling the world’s grain supply, driving up costs and further aggravating supply chains.

Even as these and other crises hammer the multitrillion-dollar industry, startup investors see potential for huge returns with tech that could boost yields, slash emissions and mitigate waste.

“There are opportunities to develop [and] adopt new technologies all along the food value chain that will impact key issues like food security and emissions,” Adam Anders, a managing partner at Anterra Capital, told TechCrunch. Among the areas where he sees the biggest potential impact, the investor cited improving plant genetics, boosting the shelf life of more products and putting digital tools in the hands of farmers.

Consumer behavior is another piece of the proverbial puzzle as climate literacy increasingly alters how folks shop.

“Over the last few years, we have seen skyrocketing interest in sustainability from consumers and food brands, and awareness over the negative impacts of agriculture continues to grow,” said Ting-Ting Liu, investor at Prosus Ventures. “People are not only paying more attention to agricultural-related emissions but also how much land and water is required to support the world’s food supply and the amount of runoff being generated,” she said.

Liu argued that this demand is creating strong tailwinds for businesses that strive to address agriculture’s environmental impact, ultimately driving more capital into everything from cellular agriculture to methane reduction solutions for livestock.

Still, agtech is not immune to some of the broader trends in venture.

While the value of agtech VC deals rose to $11.4 billion in 2021 from $6.5 billion in 2020, several investors told TechCrunch they’ve noticed a slowdown in agtech deals this year amid the wider tech downturn of 2022.

“2021 was a record year for VC across the board. In 2022, VC investments across the board are about 30% lower year on year, and I would expect a similar slowdown for agtech,” Monica Varman, a partner at G2 Venture Partners, told TechCrunch. “Over the medium to long term, however, I do expect agtech VC funding to grow, given supply chain challenges, traceability concerns and advancements in enabling technologies in synbio and robotics,” she added.

Agtech investors are also still largely funding men. Out of the nearly $11 billion dispensed into agtech in 2021, 78% went to firms with all-male founders, according to PitchBook. The disparity has only worsened so far in 2022, rising to 81% (out of nearly $7.3 billion) as of September 14, per the data firm.

To gauge whether (and how) VCs are responding to these issues and more, we reached out to:

Brett Brohl, managing director, Techstars Farm to Fork, and managing partner, Bread and Butter Ventures

Agtech VC deal value rocketed from $6.5 billion in 2020 to $11.4 billion in 2021. Will this sort of growth continue?

It’s not going to continue in the short run largely because of macroeconomic factors you’re just not seeing — for example, many late-stage deals are going through recently — so in the short term, definitely not.

In the long run, the sector has a tremendous amount of opportunity and room for innovation, so with time, you will see continued growth and investor focus on agtech.

Agriculture is responsible for about a quarter of global GhG emissions. How has the climate crisis changed how you invest?

It is a huge reason deal value skyrocketed in 2020 and 2021. Investors understand that this challenge creates an opportunity. Agtech is not as mainstream as many other sectors, so we need more eyeballs and capital. If you are making the food system more effective and efficient, you are making it more sustainable.

We aren’t a big enough fund to finance a startup forever, and we depend on later-stage investors, so this attention and resulting influx of capital helps remove some risk from our portfolio.

Which emerging technologies, such as cellular agriculture and AI-powered robots, have the greatest potential to impact key issues like food security and emissions in the next decade?

We 100% believe in cellular agriculture and are also huge fans of the robotics space, especially robotics that solve very specific pain points and have low BOMs.

“Automation and computer vision will be transformative for agriculture over the next decade, particularly as food production is moved closer to the point of consumption due to food security concerns.” Monica Varman, partner, G2 Venture Partners

We also love the packaging space — lots of packaging goes into the transportation and movement of food. We’re also excited about anything to do with logistics, manufacturing or transportation that makes the food chain more sustainable.

When investing in an agtech startup, which green flags do you look for? Are you open to backing founders who don’t have experience in the industry?

Investing in agtech startups is no different from any other company. A great team can take a C- idea, pivot, iterate and make it work. But a C- founder will run any idea into the ground, regardless of how good it is.

While founder-market fit can be a benefit to a company, great entrepreneurs are smart, have a great work ethic, are coachable and know how to surround themselves with people who make up for their weaknesses. So industry experience isn’t a requirement for us.

Which areas of agtech have received the most attention from early-stage founders in recent years? In which areas would you like to see more work done or investments?

The obvious answer is alternative proteins. So much capital has been invested and so many founders are building cool things in the space.

I’d love to see more attention paid to things that are a bit downstream, such as manufacturing, logistics and the future of food retail. Over the last few years, you have seen traditional agtech investors move their thesis further downstream, so it is happening.

I’m also really interested in fintech applications in the agriculture space, like what Traive and Milk Moovement are doing.

What are you doing to fund underrepresented founders in agtech?

We actively seek out investors, forums and networks that support underrepresented founders and invest or work with entrepreneurs that are a stage earlier than where we invest. We also maintain a diverse investment team — 75% of our fund are women.

Finally, we hold open office hours for anyone every week and provide free public education through multiple channels to help founders level up.

Before the invasion, Russia and Ukraine accounted for about 28% of wheat and 15% of corn exports globally. How has the Russian invasion of Ukraine affected agtech VC deal-making given its impact on the global supply chain and the world’s grain supply?

I don’t think it’s done much to early-stage agtech founders or venture capital. The macroeconomic effect of the war has at least, in part, been a tightening of monetary supply, which will trickle down to early-stage startups. However, the impact has not been significant at early stages yet.

Bayer bought Monsanto for $63 billion in 2018, and a year earlier, ChemChina acquired Syngenta for $43 billion. Today, Bayer’s market cap is less than that deal’s value, and China’s ambassador to Switzerland has called the Syngenta acquisition a bad deal for Beijing. Have the outcomes of these deals affected investors’ hopes for blowout late-stage exits?

I wouldn’t call these acquisitions of “modern” agtech companies. Monsanto has been around for 100+ years, and Syngenta was formed over 20 years ago, and even then it was a spin-off. Additionally, these happened in 2017 and 2018. Investment in agtech has exploded since then, indicating that the market does not think these two acquisitions are indicative of underperforming venture investments.

The outcomes of companies like Upside Foods, FBN and Indigo Ag will be far more important to the agtech ecosystem. Unfortunately, it’s a very tough market for late-stage companies right now, and that will slow exits and depress ROI on many venture investments, not just agtech deals.

How do you prefer to receive pitches? What’s the most important thing a founder should know before they get on a call with you?

I’m open to warm intros, thoughtful cold emails or pitches during my open office hours. If you’re pitching me on a call, the number one thing is to be yourself.

Anything else you’d like to comment on?

I think the blurred lines between food tech and agtech are really interesting. What is agtech? It’s not just farm inputs; there is a lot more to it and that, to me, is exciting.

Monica Varman, partner, G2 Venture Partners

Agtech VC deal value rocketed from $6.5 billion in 2020 to $11.4 billion in 2021. Will this sort of growth continue?

2021 was a record year for VC. In 2022, VC investments across the board are about 30% lower, and I would expect a similar slowdown for agtech.

Over the medium and long term, however, I do expect agtech VC funding to rise given supply chain challenges, traceability concerns and advancements in enabling technologies in synbio and robotics."

Deep valleys buried under the seafloor of the North Sea record how the ancient ice sheets that used to cover the UK and Europe expelled water to stop themselves from collapsing.

A new study published this week has surprised the research team, who discovered that the valleys took just hundreds of years to form as they transported vast amounts of meltwater away from under the ice and out into the sea.

This new understanding of when the vast ice sheets melted 20,000 years ago has implications for how glaciers may respond to climate warming today. The study is published in the journal Quaternary Science Reviews.

Tunnel valleys are enormous channels, sometimes up to 150km long, 6km wide and 500m deep (each several times larger than Loch Ness), that drain water from beneath melting ice sheets. There are thousands buried beneath the seafloor of the North Sea that record the melting of ice sheets that have covered the UK and Western Europe over the last two million years.

Lead author James Kirkham, from British Antarctic Survey (BAS) and the University of Cambridge, says, ""This is an exciting discovery. We know that these spectacular valleys are carved out during the death throes of ice sheets. By using a combination of state-of-the-art subsurface imaging techniques and a computer model, we have learnt that tunnel valleys can be eroded rapidly beneath ice sheets experiencing extreme warmth.""

The team analyzed ""jaw-droppingly detailed"" seismic images that provide a 3D scan of the Earth's buried layers. Informed by delicate clues discovered within the valleys, the authors performed a series of computer modeling experiments to simulate valley development, and test how quickly they formed as the last ice sheet to cover the UK melted away at the end of the most recent ice age about 20,000 years ago.

The research suggests that this process is quick by geological timescales, with the melting ice forming giant tunnel valleys within hundreds of years, expelling water that could otherwise accelerate rates of ice loss.

Traditionally, the drainage of water from beneath ice sheets is thought to stabilize ice flow, a process that could potentially buffer modern ice sheets from collapse in a warming climate. But while inspecting the detailed seismic scans, the authors began to find tell-tale signatures of both stagnant and rapid ice movement within the valleys, complicating the picture of how these rapidly forming channels might affect future ice sheet behavior.

What is certain, is that the surprisingly fast rate at which these tunnels form means that scientists need to start considering their effects in models of how today's ice sheets will evolve in the coming decades to centuries.

There are no modern analogs for this rapid process, but these ancient valleys, now buried hundreds of meters beneath the muds of the North Sea seafloor, record a mechanism for how ice sheets respond to extreme warmth that is missing from present-day ice sheet models. Such models do not currently resolve fine-scale water drainage processes, despite them appearing to be an important control on future ice loss rates and ultimately sea level rise.

""The pace at which these giant channels can form means that they are an important, yet currently ignored, mechanism that may potentially help to stabilize ice sheets in a warming world. As climate change continues to drive the retreat of the modern-day Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets at ever increasing rates, our results call for renewed investigation of how tunnel valleys may help to stabilize contemporary ice losses, and therefore sea level rise, if they switch on beneath the Earth's ice sheets in the future,"" says James Kirkham.

Dr. Kelly Hogan, co-author and a geophysicist at BAS, says, ""We have been observing these huge meltwater channels from areas covered by ice sheets in the past for more than a century but we did not really understand how they formed. Our results show, for the first time, that the most important mechanism is probably summer melting at the ice surface that makes its way to the bed through cracks or chimneys-like conduits and then flows under the pressure of the ice sheet to cut the channels.

""Surface melting is already hugely important for the Greenland Ice Sheet today, and this process of water transport through the system will only increase as our climate warms. The crucial question now is will this 'extra' meltwater flow in channels cause our ice sheets to flow more quickly, or more slowly, into the sea.""

The work highlights a currently overlooked process that can rapidly switch on beneath melting ice sheets. Whether these channels will act to stabilize or destabilize the Earth's contemporary ice sheets in a warming world remains an important and open question.

Below the North Sea, thousands of hidden giant valleys scoured out by retreating ice sheets 20,000 years ago are providing new insights into how the worsening climate crisis could impact our planet as it warms.

New research into these valleys has found they could form in ""just hundreds of years"", allowing the transportation of enormous volumes of water, as the ice age ended.

Today’s sea level is around 130 metres higher than it was at the peak of the last ice age.

Back then, Britain was a peninsula of mainland Europe, and large rivers such as the Rhine and the Thames were only tributaries to the river which eventually became the English Channel.

As the ice receded, it unleashed huge volumes of water – sometimes unevenly, which reshaped the landscape.

The new research shows the scale and the speed of a process of intense erosion beneath the ice sheets which is believed to have helped funnel melt water away from them, helping prevent a more rapid collapse.

The scientists said these tunnel valleys, found beneath the modern seabed, can be up to 500 metres deep, 5km wide and 150km long – making each of them several times larger than Loch Ness.

Lead author James Kirkham, from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) and the University of Cambridge, said: “This is an exciting discovery. We know that these spectacular valleys are carved out during the death throes of ice sheets.

""By using a combination of state-of-the-art subsurface imaging techniques and a computer model, we have learnt that tunnel valleys can be eroded rapidly beneath ice sheets experiencing extreme warmth.”

These huge valleys were carved out beneath ice sheets in just a few hundred years, and helped divert meltwater to the ocean and away from the ice (James Kirkham/BAS)

The team said they analysed ""jaw-droppingly detailed"" seismic images which provide a 3D scan of the Earth’s buried layers.

Informed by ""delicate clues"" discovered within the valleys, the authors performed a series of computer modelling experiments to simulate valley development, and test how quickly they formed as the last ice sheet to cover the UK melted away at the end of the most recent ice age about 20,000 years ago.

The researchers said the ""surprisingly fast rate"" at which these tunnel valleys form means scientists must start considering their creation and effect on models used to understand how today’s ice sheets may be impacted over the coming decades and centuries.

""There are no modern analogues for this rapid process"", the authors said, but these ancient valleys, now buried hundreds of metres beneath the muds of the North Sea seafloor, record a mechanism for how ice sheets respond to extreme warmth that is missing from present-day ice sheet models.

The models do not currently resolve all water drainage processes, despite them appearing to be an important factor influencing future ice loss rates and ultimately sea level rise around the world.

Mr Kirkham, a PhD student, said: “The pace at which these giant channels can form means that they are an important, yet currently ignored, mechanism that may potentially help to stabilise ice sheets in a warming world.

""As climate change continues to drive the retreat of the modern-day Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets at ever-increasing rates, our results call for renewed investigation of how tunnel valleys may help to stabilise contemporary ice losses, and therefore sea level rise, if they switch on beneath the Earth’s ice sheets in the future.”

264677c0-21ea-46a5-818f-2ff3776a5ea9,"There are plans to scale up these activities with a carbon market scheme developed by the UK's National Environmental Research Council and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Landowners can sell the carbon saved by restoration as carbon offsets – with the current projects lined up under the scheme across the UK, this could amount to the equivalent of an estimated 570,000 tonnes of CO2, or 230,000 personal flights from London to Sydney. (Read about the promise and pitfalls of offsetting and carbon markets elsewhere on Future Planet.)

The flow of greenhouse gases into and out of the bog is, however, remarkably complex. As well as the climate and water levels, factors like the plant species present and the precise lay of the ridges and furrows of the land can have a significant influence on the flow of gases in and out of the bog.

What's more, bog restoration isn't a zero-sum game: drying out a bog releases carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, but rewetting one can cause a second surge in emissions – this time of methane, a greenhouse gas 84 times more potent than CO2 over a 20-year period, but shorter-lived than CO2 in the atmosphere.

""That's the downfall of rewetting,"" says Coleen Murty, a research assistant at Newcastle University who completed her PhD on carbon cycling in peatlands. ""Obviously researchers have found that rewetting is really helpful for reducing CO2 emissions, so it's all about understanding the trade-offs.""

At the moment, there's little that can be done to prevent this post-rewetting surge. But Murty hopes that one day it might be possible to enhance our current techniques with a class of compounds that sphagnum moss naturally releases into its watery surroundings. These are phenolics, which are thought to act as antioxidants – compounds that absorb harmful ""free radicals"" that cause oxidation. ""Antioxidants are really important, not just for peat but for humans as well,"" says Murty.

The sphagnum moss secretes phenolics through pores in its cell walls, which the compounds help to stabilise. The phenolics are also anti-microbial, helping prevent microbes from breaking down the plant – and they are thought to chemically suppress methane generation in deeper layers of peat. However, when you dry peat and kill the sphagnum, it no longer releases phenolics. ""The sphagnum tissue dries out and starts to crumble away"" and the methane-suppressing phenolics are lost, says Murty. When the bog is rewetted in the absence of such compounds, methane produced in the oxygen-poor deep peat can bubble to the surface.

In the lab, Murty's and her colleagues' work has shown promising hints that adding phenolics to deep peat may provide a source of antioxidants thought to suppress methane generation. But, she notes, it is a long way from lab studies to the complex reality of the bog. ""There's not many field studies in these things yet, so it would be great to do those,"" says Murty. ""It's pretty novel.""

One of the main challenges is from the sheer size of the bogs. ""They cover really large areas in Scotland,"" says Murty. ""I think the limitations of doing chemistry research on restoration could be how would we implement this on a larger scale, and how much would it cost to alter the chemistry of the bog?""

(It's worth noting that despite no solution yet to the methane surge after rewetting, promptly restoring degraded bogs leads to fewer greenhouse gas emissions in the long run than leaving them degraded – curbing the methane release would be an added bonus.)"
a687ec9d-5f1f-4b16-b717-99139b994dd4,"The landmark Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) enacted last month is simultaneously the most significant U.S. climate legislation and not nearly enough to put the issue to rest. Climate modelers estimate U.S. emissions will now fall 40% below 2005 levels by 2030. But California still needs to reach its more ambitious goal of net zero by 2045. State and local leaders should implement additional climate policies, particularly around emissions from buildings and transportation, that will leverage the IRA and fill the gaps.

State and local representatives have good policy levers to tackle emissions from buildings that come from burning fossil gas, mostly for space and water heating. The IRA provides incentives to install electric appliances, and there are local incentives, too. Programs for low- to moderate-income households are even more generous and, when combined with local incentives, will cover the extra costs of electric space and water heating in most cases. This should give local policymakers the confidence to require that when owners replace gas appliances, they do so with electric equivalents, and state lawmakers should set an end date for their sale as the California Air Resources Board recently did for fully gas-powered cars. Most households can electrify using existing electrical panels, but for those who need upgrades, the state should ensure low costs and require utilities to respond within days, not months. Additionally, city councils should set an end date for the flow of gas, as Half Moon Bay did when it set an end date of 2045.

Transportation is California’s top emissions source. Policy should encourage people to use climate-friendly modes of transportation as much as possible and to electrify their remaining personal vehicle miles. Cities should continue advocating for robust public transit to minimize wait times and transfers. E-bikes are an environmentally beneficial substitute for cars, and rebates are a cheap and effective intervention; they fell out of the IRA during negotiations, so state and local policymakers should create their own programs. Cities also need networks of slow green streets so bicyclists and pedestrians can move about confident in their safety. Finally, EV charging will be critical, especially for people who live in multi-family housing who also deserve to enjoy the benefits of EVs. Currently, rate plans incentivize charging overnight, but new infrastructure should enable transitioning to daytime charging when renewables are abundant. In the future, EVs will be able to send some of that electricity back to the grid during the evening when we sometimes have flex alerts, enhancing grid resilience.

A number of IRA grant programs are also available, and Californians should get their fair share. They include grants for environmental justice projects in disadvantaged communities, zero emissions school and transit buses, pollution reduction at ports, and urban forests and parks. Finally, our public universities should find ways to access the research funding in the IRA.

From the passage of the IRA to California’s EV transition to the nearly 60 cities and counties in the state that have adopted some form of all-electric building codes, the tide has turned in favor of climate action. The World Health Organization found that the health benefits associated with mitigating the impacts of air pollution alone far outweigh the costs of meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement. In a recent survey, the Public Policy Institute of California found that 68% of likely voters favor the state making its own climate policy, separate from the federal government. Climate is a winning issue in California, and the Bay Area and our leaders should seize the initiative. Let’s go!

c3f30d8d-967e-4879-8512-6a1a5a4f8bb7,"“Carbon tax, beloved policy to fix climate change, is dead at 47.”

As early as last summer, an article in The Atlantic declared the so-called political “death” of carbon pricing. With the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) last month, many critics feel vindicated in their skepticism of the policy.

The IRA, which cleared Congress with only Democratic votes after a grueling year-long negotiation process, will direct $370 billion in tax credits and other measures toward addressing climate change and help cut U.S. emissions by an additional 7-10% by 2030.

Missing, however, was a price on carbon — the market-based tool, long favored by economic experts, that would assess a fee on carbon emissions to accelerate the development and deployment of clean energy.

Advertisement

This absence has emboldened some commentators to level a broader — and incorrect — critique of the policy. The failure to include a carbon price in the reconciliation bill, they argue, speaks to the political folly of an economy-wide financial penalty on carbon emissions. By contrast, they argue, the recently passed climate bill demonstrates that subsidies and government spending are the true pathway to climate progress.

Never mind that 49 out of the 50 senators involved in reconciliation negotiations, and the White House, were ready to support a carbon price during this congressional session. And that a growing number of Republicans have started expressing support for the idea as well — making it the only climate policy of comparable impact to the IRA that enjoys some level of bipartisan backing.

Never mind that carbon pricing would actually be more effective at reducing emissions than the clean energy tax credits contained within the partisan IRA. And that carbon pricing is likely essential if we are to decarbonize our economy at the scale and speed necessary.

Never mind that Fortune 500 companies are increasingly assessing internal carbon prices across their own operations, on the assumption that this kind of policy will inevitably come down the pike.

Never mind that more than 85% of global emissions come from outside the United States, something the IRA does not address.

Never mind that this idea of a border adjustment — which would give American manufacturers a competitive edge — has attracted strong and growing bipartisan support.

Never mind that countries around the world already have begun pricing carbon, including Canada, the U.K., South Korea, and the European Union. And that other nations are also marching ahead on carbon pricing systems, including India, Israel, South Africa, among others.

Never mind that the IRA includes a fee on methane, a concrete example of U.S. emissions pricing in action. And that this same approach of pollution pricing is how the U.S. successfully addressed the acid rain challenge on a bipartisan basis in the 1990s, under budget and ahead of schedule.

The trajectory of carbon pricing support is clear and unmistakable. In the last five years, there has been a sea change on this topic in the U.S., with major businesses, trade associations, and environmental experts aligning themselves in support of this policy approach.

This doesn’t mean a national carbon pricing policy is imminent. But, as we plot our next steps on climate policy, it highlights why carbon pricing deserves to be an area of strategic focus.

To set the stage for strong and durable action, there also has to be organizing outside the Beltway — efforts to marshal enough public support, at the state and district levels, to create the conditions for legislative breakthroughs.

As crucial as this organizing is, it has been largely nonexistent in most of the country, especially on a bipartisan basis. This provides a clear opening for future organizing and investment by environmental and philanthropic leaders.

Carbon pricing hasn’t seen its moment at the national scale — yet. But the significant, cross-sectoral coalition that has assembled in support of this policy illuminates an emerging pathway to the next legislative breakthrough on climate, and we should take it. Not as our only approach, but as one in a basket of strategies to do all we can on the most important issue of our time.

They’ll take to the skies to map the minerals, which are crucial to the Biden administration’s plans to build up American clean energy industries.

GEMx is the name of the joint research effort, which will launch with $16 million in funding made possible through the bipartisan infrastructure law, which passed last year. Over the next five years, NASA’s ER-2 and Gulfstream V aircraft will fly over parts of California, Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico to collect data that could point to where critical mineral resources are most abundant.

Both aircraft will carry a powerful instrument, NASA’s Airborne Visible / Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), for high-altitude remote sensing. The instrument will measure reflections of light from the Earth’s surface, hyperspectral data that ranges from visible to infrared light. Each mineral reflects light slightly differently, giving it a unique “spectral signature” that can be spotted using these instruments. They’re on the hunt for minerals still in the ground and in mine waste.

Minerals deemed “critical” to the US economy and national security

The goal of the work is to identify the best places to find minerals deemed “critical” to the US economy and national security. The US’s current list of critical minerals includes lithium, nickel, and cobalt, all crucial for making rechargeable batteries, which are used to store renewable energy and power electric vehicles. There’s also tellurium used in solar cells as well as graphite and the rare-earth scandium used in fuel cells — technologies with the potential to produce clean energy.

Global demand for critical minerals is expected to explode over the next few decades as governments work to transition to clean energy economies. An electric vehicle typically requires six times more mineral resources than a gas-guzzling vehicle, for example. Without enough minerals on hand — whether that’s from mining or more recycling, a shortage of these materials could delay clean energy dreams.

The Biden administration has made it a priority to shore up domestic supply chains for clean energy technologies and the materials needed to make batteries, turbines, and solar panels. In March, Biden invoked the Defense Production Act to expand the domestic production and processing of critical minerals used in clean energy industries. The administration has also doled out millions of dollars in funding for mapping, mining, and refining minerals."

Bill Gates Says Preventing People From Eating Meat Is ‘Too Difficult’

Bill Gates has said that it is impractical to insist on reducing meat consumption in order to combat climate change.

“Anyone who says that we will tell people to stop eating meat, or stop wanting to have a nice house, and we’ll just basically change human desires, I think that that’s too difficult,” Gates said in an interview with Bloomberg. The billionaire went on to point out that such things do not necessarily have to play a key role in fighting climate change.

Rich nations only make up a third of global emissions, with the remaining two-thirds coming from “pretty basic” things like shelter, calories, transport, and the use of goods, Gates said.

Even if the “excesses” of rich nations are curbed out of existence, it still won’t be a solution to the climate change issue, he insisted.

“I’m looking at what the world has to do to get to zero, not using climate as a moral crusade,” he said.

Though Gates took a stance against climate activists’ push to stop people from eating meat, he said he supports societies switching to synthetic meat.

In an interview with MIT Technology Review last February, Gates said that he believes all rich countries should move to 100 percent synthetic beef. Though there might be a difference in taste between real and synthetic meat, Gates claimed that companies will make it taste better over time.

“Eventually, that green premium is modest enough that you can sort of change the [behavior of] people or use regulation to totally shift the demand,” he said.

However, Gates added that the poorest 80 nations will likely not be eating synthetic meat. For Africa and other poor nations, the billionaire expects animal genetics to “dramatically” increase the amount of beef per emissions.

Meat Benefits

Eating meat is beneficial to the human body. One study conducted by researchers from the Queensland Brain Institute (QBI), Australia, found that selenium, a mineral found in meat and some other foods, has the potential to reverse the decline in brain function from old age or poor health.

Another study conducted by researchers from the University of Adelaide looked into the health effects of total meat consumption in more than 170 nations. They found that consumption of energy from meat does result in greater life expectancy.

Some studies have linked meat-free diets with improved health. However, nutritionist Yanfei Ge thinks that such research might be biased, according to a Feb. 22 press release.

“Studies looking into the diets of wealthy, highly educated communities, are looking at people who have the purchasing power and the knowledge to select plant-based diets that access the full nutrients normally contained in meat,” Ge said. “Essentially, they have replaced meat with all the same nutrition meat provides.”"
851b3472-32c1-4cfc-8809-284d77983cbf,"""Well, innovation is not just a check-writing process the cost is way greater than what anyone could fund,"" he told Bloomberg Green reporter Akshat Rathi.

On the latest episode of Bloomberg's Zero podcast, Rathi interviewed Gates about climate tech and the Inflation Reduction Act passed this August, which will invest $369 million into climate solutions in order to reduce US carbon emissions by 40% over the next eight years.

The billionaire philanthropist founded the organization Breakthrough Energy in 2015 to invest in clean energy technologies and was instrumental to the bill's passage behind the scenes, Bloomberg reports. The hands-on approach differs from recent charitable donations of other billionaires, a practice that Gates argues is less effective.

""You've also said that we need to do everything we can to accelerate innovation. What's stopping you from giving away all your money to innovation right now?"" Rathi asked Gates on Thursday's podcast.

In response, Gates provided the example of when he became involved in ""reinventing"" nuclear fission through TerraPower, a nuclear reactor design company he founded in 2015.

""I put about a billion dollars into that,"" he said. ""But my key value-add was finding the basic idea for much safer, cheaper, low-waste solutions, and bringing those brilliant people together on the software modeling skills.""

Gates also pointed to the Inflation Reduction Act as a second example of how climate tech innovation is ""not just purely a financial thing.""

""I was personally involved in a lot of what got written into it, and then working with the key senators in the last month to get it to pass that's far greater than any individual fortune. And I'm orchestrating a lot of people,"" he said.

Later in the interview, Gates said he invests around $9 million a year toward climate initiatives."

Gates says he played a key role in the Inflation Reduction Act, which will help cut carbon emissions.

Bill Gates said the climate crisis will not be solved by expecting people to radically change their lifestyle over concerns about the environment.

""Anyone who says telling people to stop eating meat or wanting to have a nice house will basically change human desires, I think, that is too difficult,"" he told Bloomberg's Zero podcast. ""You can make a case for it, but I don't think it's realistic for that to play a central role.""



The billionaire philanthropist discussed the US climate bill in the podcast and said that climate change could not be solved without innovation.



""We're not even trying to make breakthroughs, such as inventing an economic way of making aviation fuel, cement or steel,"" he said. ""The existing tools only apply to areas like electricity generation and don't apply to most of the emissions.""



Gates has long been a supporter of climate change innovation. In 2015 he founded TerraPower, which designs nuclear reactors, and launched Breakthrough Energy, an investment vehicle that has invested in almost 100 clean-energy companies.



He has also funded a number of start-ups including Turntide, which creates energy-efficient electric motors, and lithium start-up Mangrove Lithium. Last year he published a book titled ""How To Avoid A Climate Disaster"" that calls for climate innovation.



The world's fifth-richest person also said in the interview that he played a key role in the Inflation Reduction Act, which has allocated almost $370 billion to help cut US carbon emissions by 40% over the next eight years.



""I am getting governments involved and this latest bill I was personally involved in a lot of what got written into it and working with the key senators in the last month to get it passed,"" he said."
6cb37685-3f9b-4c21-900c-a3831a368c28,"Climate change will never be solved by asking or expecting others to live greener lifestyles, according to Bill Gates.

Speaking on Thursday’s episode of Bloomberg’s Zero podcast, Gates said expectations that people were going to “utterly change their lifestyle because of concerns about climate” were “unrealistic.”

“You can have a cultural revolution where you’re trying to throw everything up, you can create a North Korean–type situation where the state’s in control,” he said. “Other than immense central authority to have people just obey, I think the collective action problem is just completely not solvable.”

Gates, the fifth richest person in the world, has long publicized his interest in bringing the climate crisis under control—by writing a book titled How to Avoid a Climate Disaster, advocating for green innovation, and investing in the space himself.

Although Gates has a long history of working to alleviate the effects of climate change, the Microsoft cofounder stressed in Thursday’s episode of Zero that “not that many people are prepared to be worse off because of climate requirements.”

“Anyone who says that we will tell people to stop eating meat, or stop wanting to have a nice house, and we’ll just basically change human desires, I think that that’s too difficult,” he said on Thursday. “You can make a case for it. But I don’t think it’s realistic for that to play an absolutely central role.”

Possible solutions

Gates, whose foundations have invested hundreds of millions in climate initiatives, said last year that so-called Green Premiums—which offer people the chance to pay more to do or consume the same things without the emissions—could be a viable solution to reducing emissions without demanding people rethink their consumption habits.

The billionaire philanthropist, who said he pays $9 million a year to counteract his carbon footprint, told podcast host Akshat Rathi that a better solution is to invest in green innovations—but he noted that there are various other important social issues competing for funding.

Story continues

“But just having a few rich countries, a few rich companies, and a few rich individuals buy their way out so they can say they’re not part of the problem, that has nothing to do with solving the problem,” he added.

Gates also poured cold water on theories that green energy solutions could reduce Western reliance on Russian natural gas exports anytime soon.

“When people say to me, ‘Hey, we love your climate stuff, because we can tell Putin we don’t need him,’ I say, ‘Yeah, 10 years from now call him up and tell him you don’t need him,’” he told Bloomberg’s Rathi.

979a613f-2f01-4d1f-8644-12e1762472d1,"Hurricane Ian first made landfall in western Cuba as a category 3 storm, wiping out power for 11 million people. It continued northwards over the Gulf of Mexico where it strengthened over exceptionally warm ocean water (which meteorologists describe as “rocket fuel” for hurricanes).

On reaching the coast of Florida, Ian made landfall as a category 4 storm with winds of up to 249km/h (155mph) as well as storm surges and torrential rain.

But Ian wasn’t finished there. The hurricane carved a path of destruction across the state before sweeping back out to sea, where it refuelled and turned northwards, striking South Carolina and driving deeper into the US.

Ian cut power to 2.7 million homes in Florida alone. Millions of people were evacuated ahead of time, but many stayed and the death toll is thought to be high. Though the extent of damage is not yet known, it is probably in the tens of billions of dollars and may exceed a hundred billion dollars, as only a few storms have before.

Devastating hurricanes are often seen as an indication that global warming is intensifying. While this makes a compelling headline, exactly how, where and when climate change affects extreme weather is more complex. Understanding these complexities can help countries and communities decide how to adapt to mounting storms – and when it’s better to make the difficult choice to relocate.

How do hurricanes form?

Most hurricanes in the North Atlantic begin as low-pressure weather systems moving off the west coast of Africa towards the Caribbean.

A specific set of conditions is necessary for these seeds to evolve into hurricanes: warm, moist air, winds that are fairly consistent in the upper and lower atmosphere, and, most importantly, a seawater temperature above 27°C. This is the lifeblood of a hurricane and provides all of its energy.

Warm, moist air and high ocean temperatures are in ample supply in a rapidly warming world. Yet there is no evidence that hurricanes are happening more often, nor do scientists expect this to change with further climate change.

Instead, those that do occur are more likely to be major hurricanes (categories 3 to 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale). Each successive category on this scale has far more destructive potential than the previous one.

Because ocean temperatures are warming everywhere, conditions that breed hurricanes are now found further north and south of the equator than they used to be. And hurricanes form outside the seasons people once expected them.

There is also evidence that they are moving more slowly, and are increasingly likely to completely stall near the coast, leading to more flooding as more rain is dumped over one place. This was one reason why Hurricane Harvey, which struck Texas and Louisiana in 2017, was so destructive.

But what does all of this mean for how people experience hurricanes?

Brave new whirls

It is well-established that a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture – about 7% more for each degree celsius of temperature rise. Combined with the observed slowing, this means hurricanes, which are already responsible for some of the heaviest rainfall on the planet, tend to dump a vast amount of extra water in a warmer world.

Scientists have studied the rainfall from several recent storms and consistently confirmed this pattern. The rainfall totals from Hurricanes Katrina, Irma, Maria, Harvey, Dorian and Florence were all made more intense by climate change.

Together, these storms were responsible for over half a trillion dollars in damage. In the case of Harvey, the amount of extra rain due to climate change was 15% – over twice as much as one would expect from warmer air temperatures alone.

To date, there has been no significant increase in hurricane wind speeds due to climate change. But a landmark study on storms Katrina, Irma and Maria showed that by the end of the century, the wind speeds of similar storms would be around 24km/h (15mph) faster, as hurricanes draw more power from warmer waters and can sustain more intense low pressure in the atmosphere.

Hurricanes that move more slowly also expose people and properties to powerful winds for longer, even if the winds themselves are not amplified.

Hurricane Sandy struck New York and the eastern seaboard of the US in autumn 2012, causing more than US$60 billion (£53.5 billion) in damages. Since that disaster, scientists have calculated that sea level rise due to global warming increased the height of the storm surge significantly. In doing so, it directly affected 71,000 extra people and led to an additional US$8.1 billion in damage.

The elevated surge experienced during Sandy is replicated to some degree in every hurricane. In Florida’s Fort Myers, average sea levels are now around 0.15 metres (half a foot) higher than they were in 1965.

This and neighbouring Cape Coral, known as the “Waterfront Wonderland” for its extensive coastal development, remain two of the US’s fastest growing cities. The latter has been built over mangrove swampland that provides natural storm protection and is one of the greatest natural carbon sinks.

As winds become more powerful, they could whip up even bigger storm surges in the future. In this way, several of the effects of climate change on hurricanes compound one another.

The fossil fuel premium

Scientists are increasingly capable of pinning a price on the influence of greenhouse gas emissions on some extreme weather events. North Atlantic hurricanes are a critical case, both because of the strong evidence for their link to climate change and the sheer scale of the destruction they unleash.

Based on the existing science, we believe it is now reasonable to approximate the damages due to climate change. In the case of each intense hurricane that makes landfall like Ian, especially when it strikes densely populated areas, climate change is probably responsible for extra damages on the order of US$10 billion, as well as disruption to the lives of tens to hundreds of thousands more people.

Florida, like much of the Caribbean and the eastern US, is in a precarious position. Recent efforts to avert coastal flooding will no doubt ameliorate some of the worst effects of Hurricane Ian and pay dividends in storms for years to come. But tackling these symptoms is futile if the ultimate cause – greenhouse gas emissions – remains unaddressed.

Miami Herald (TNS)

MIAMI — It’s a question that follows any natural disaster, especially monster hurricanes like Ian: Was this caused by climate change?

When asked, scientists like Kevin Reed usually push back. Most researchers agree it’s not valid to point to a single storm and say it was “caused” by the warming world. Too many variables.

“That is a question that is really difficult to answer. There is no ‘what would have September 2022 looked like without climate change?’ We don’t have that,” said Reed, an associate professor in the school of marine and atmospheric sciences at Stony Brook University.

But there’s a growing consensus that the sea level rise and higher temperatures in the last hundred years have already impacted storms like Ian, which raked Florida last week, and may continue to do so in the future. At the very least, hotter weather means hotter oceans, which fuel hurricane strength.

“We live in a world that’s over 1 degree warmer (Celsius), there’s no doubt that hurricanes have changed in some respect because of climate change,” he said.

It's complicated: Tom Knutson, a senior scientist at NOAA studying climate and hurricanes, said scientists are most confident in noticing what’s changed about storms in the modern world. But less so about being able to connect those changes to climate change. Predicting what the future could hold is even tougher.

That’s because hurricanes and global weather patterns are devilishly complicated. Some of the changes in the atmosphere and storms, for example, can be attributed to the high levels of physical air pollution, beyond greenhouse gases, spewed into the atmosphere.

Storm-tracking technology also has massively improved in recent centuries. Scientists agree we now are catching many more “junk storms” — short-lived and weak cyclones — than ever. That can skew data, which is why most scientists are cautious when drawing a direct line between a hotter globe and hurricanes numbers.

“It’s quite a complex picture and adding to the complexity, we’re inferring many of these things from climate models which themselves have uncertainty,” Knutson said. “We have to be careful.”

Here’s where the science stands on several fronts:

Higher storm surge likely: Sea levels near South Florida have already risen about eight inches since 1950, according to NOAA tidal gauge data. That means the water is starting from a higher base level, allowing hurricane surge to reach a few inches higher and cover more ground.

Researchers expect sea level rise to accelerate as hotter temperatures cause polar ice sheets to melt faster. Over the next century, South Florida can expect to see more than three feet of sea level rise, according to estimates from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). That will push storm surge higher when hurricanes roll through coastal communities.

One 2020 study modeled what 21 hurricanes that struck between 2000 and 2013 might look like under the climate conditions expected in 2100. The researchers estimated that, on average, floods would have been about 30% worse and covered about a quarter more land.

More extreme rainfall: One of the most straightforward connections between climate change and hurricanes is rain. Like anyone who’s experienced humidity knows, warmer air holds more moisture.

For every 2 degrees Fahrenheit of warming, there is about 8% more water in the atmosphere, and the world has warmed at least 2 degrees Fahrenheit since pre-industrial times.

So perhaps it’s no surprise that one study of the 2020 hurricane season found an average 8% increase in 3-day rainfall totals for hurricanes, and a 5% increase for tropical storms.

The lead author, Stony Brook’s Reed, said they also found that a hotter planet increased the rate of rainfall. In the 2020 season, three-hour rainfall rates would increase 10% or higher for tropical storms and hurricanes.

“If you experience a similar storm in the future it’s going to rain more because of climate change,” he said. “If you had 30 inches of rain, you could say over 2.5 inches of that rain was due to climate change, meaning it would not have rained as much if we hadn’t heated the planet.”

Reed and his colleagues also produced a rapid study of Hurricane Ian on Thursday that suggested a 10% increase in extreme rain rates due to human-caused climate change.

This body of research, known as attribution science, looks to answer the question of how climate change influenced a particular storm. In Reed’s case, he and his colleagues load up a powerful supercomputer weather model with the exact track and data from a modern-day storm, then re-set the clock back to the temperature and atmospheric conditions of the 1850s.

The clearest change they see is the storms are far less wet when set in the past.

Getting stronger faster: One of the most dangerous features of hurricanes is rapid intensification, which is when a storm’s top wind speeds increase 35 mph or more in a single day. It’s also difficult to predict so when a storm suddenly strengthens near the shore, coastal communities have little time to prepare or evacuate.

Early studies suggest climate change has already made rapid intensification more common. A 2021 IPCC report found that “the global frequency of [tropical cyclone] rapid intensification events has likely increased over the past four decades” and added that researchers have “medium confidence” that “none of these changes can be explained by natural variability alone.”

Researchers can say with much more certainty that the conditions that lead to rapid intensification are becoming more common. Sea surface temperatures are rising at a rate of 0.14 degrees Fahrenheit per decade, according to NOAA, and atmospheric moisture is increasing between one and two percent per decade, according to the IPCC. Both of these factors may give future hurricanes more fuel to turbocharge their growth.

Meanwhile, NOAA and Columbia University researchers predict that climate change will weaken vertical wind shear, an atmospheric feature that can pump the brakes on rapid intensification.

“We’ve seen multiple studies that show the conditions in the North Atlantic basin are providing more opportunities for storms to intensify,” said Kieran Bhatia, a former climate researcher at Princeton University who is now a vice president for the climate change perils advisory team at the insurance broker Guy Carpenter.

Fewer hurricanes, but stronger: Climate change might make hurricanes more intense but less frequent.

Reliable global records of hurricane intensity only go back about four decades, when weather satellites began scientists to accurately estimate the strength of storms. In the years since, hurricanes appear to be getting stronger, according to a 2020 paper from researchers at NOAA and the University of Wisconsin. They found that the likelihood that a cyclone will reach Category 3 wind speeds — the threshold to be designated a “major hurricane” — has risen about 25% since 1979, as extra heat in the oceans and atmosphere gives storms more fuel to grow.

But even as climate change makes storms stronger, scientists believe it is weakening the ocean currents that help cyclones form in the first place — particularly the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), which pulls warm surface waters from the tropics across the Atlantic Ocean. The IPCC’s 2021 report says the AMOC, which also powers the Gulf Stream, is “very likely” to weaken over the 21st century.

As a result, hurricanes may become less frequent. A July paper published in Nature Climate Change estimated that tropical cyclones formed 13% less often in the 20th century than they did between 1850 and 1900. Although hurricane data before the satellite era is spotty, the international team of researchers combined real world observations with simulations from climate models to fill in the gaps and estimate the number of hurricanes that may have formed from 1850 to 2012.

“A string of consecutive seasons with Category 5s, that’s something more consistent with what we’d expect in a warmer climate … as opposed to a higher number of storms,” Brian Soden, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, told the Miami Herald in 2020.Slower and wetter storms

Jim Kosin, a climate scientist at the NOAA Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies in Madison, Wisconsin, published a paper in 2018 that suggested that tropical storms and hurricanes around the world had slowed down about 10% between 1949 and 2016, and hit the brakes even harder over land.

It was met with some criticism in the scientific community, but he followed it up with another research paper with NASA’s Timothy Hall in 2019 that narrowed in on the slowdown of storms near the North American coast since 1950.They found that hurricane forward speed has decreased since 1900, which can lead to even more rainfall and flooding as a storm stalls over land.

“More study is needed to determine how much more slowing will occur with continued warming. Still, it’s entirely plausible that local rainfall increases could actually be dominated by this slowdown rather than the expected rain-rate increases due to global warming,” Kossin told a NOAA blog.

Knutson, with NOAA, called it “the most convincing evidence of a trend I’ve seen so far.”

But he cautioned that just because the trend was observed doesn’t automatically mean climate change is to blame. ”That’s an open research question.”

More landfalls may be in future: In the past, many storms at sea went undetected unless reported by vessels unlucky enough to encounter them. But good records go back a century or more on ones that make shore.

New research by Knutson, based on running past data into a computer model, projects what might happen to hurricane paths in the future if global warming continues unchecked. He found that while the number of storms making landfall hasn’t really changed that much in the last century, an increasing fraction could in the future could.

Combined with other research suggesting that fewer but more powerful storms could form in the future, Knutson said his findings suggest that cities are in for fewer, but increasingly intense hits.

“It’s kind of several effects cutting in different directions,” he said.

Ever the careful scientist, Knutson also cautioned that his work was only a prediction.

“That’s in the model. We’ll see what happens in the real world,” he said."

Hurricane Ian, which peaked as a Category 4 storm in the Gulf of Mexico, hammered Southwest Florida this week, flooding the coastal areas around Fort Myers, leaving millions of people without power, and causing an unknown number of deaths. Ian lost some of its intensity as it crossed the state, but began regaining strength over the Atlantic, before veering back inland to slam Georgia and the Carolinas.

Ian is doing what all tropical cyclones are known to do: build up energy when there is a warm water source to pull from. Which is why these types of storms, also known as typhoons or hurricanes, benefit from global warming. Over decades, greenhouse gasses like carbon dioxide have been building up, absorbing heat that is causing temperatures in both the atmosphere (which holds more water vapor when heated) and the oceans to increase. That warming effect is like a performance enhancer for cyclones, giving them optimized fuel to strengthen and then devastate whatever lies in their paths.

One PNAS study from 2020 found that, as of 2017, about 38% of the planet’s tropical cyclone activity reached major intensity (that is, a Category 3, 4, or 5). For North Atlantic hurricanes specifically, the rate was similar at 42%. But those rates have been ticking up over time—particularly in the North Atlantic.

As the below chart shows, it’s 24% more probable today that a cyclone on planet earth will be at major intensity compared with four decades ago. In the North Atlantic, it’s about 260% more probable.



In other words, the likelihood that Ian would be a Category 3 storm or greater was around three times higher than if it had formed back in 1980. While global warming has a lot to do with that uptick, there are other factors at play that contribute to regional differences, says Jim Kossin, senior scientist with The Climate Service, an S&P Global Company, and co-author of the paper.

Story continues

“In addition to greenhouse gasses, which are uniformly mixed around the world, the Atlantic has also had a reduction in pollution aerosols,” Kassin says. “Some of that is a reduction of Saharan dust in the last 40 years,” he explains, referring to the evidence that hotter sea surface temperatures are weakening trade winds from Africa that transport the dust. “And some of it is a reduction in sulfate pollution from industry, after the Clean Air Act passed in the 1970s.”

Read more: See the Devastating Toll of Hurricane Ian in Florida

Effectively, smoggy airborne particles like dust, soot, and sulfates act like an umbrella, dimming the sun’s rays. That cooling effect counteracts some of the heating effects from global warming. As air pollution levels around North America and Europe have dropped, that pollution umbrella has thinned, allowing more sunlight to reach—and warm—the surface in these regions.

To determine how much storm intensity has increased over four decades, Kossin and his co-authors relied on track position data, adjusted using satellite imagery (hence why his analysis goes back to 1978, when there were a sufficient number of weather satellites). They dimmed the resolution on the more recent images in order to compare them against early images, and control for the improved hurricane tracking and measuring technology over time.

Because the position data stretched over the lifetime of each storm, the researchers could see not just the peak intensity of the storm, but also intensity duration along the storm’s path. That method provided a more accurate characterization of each cyclone season than simply counting the number of storms that were Category 3 or more, because hurricane categories are based on maximum sustained near-surface winds, without regard to whether those winds lasted for minutes, hours, or days.

While the data end in 2017—the most recent available at the time of the analysis—it’s likely that the overall trends have continued, or have become even stronger in the years since, says James Done, a project scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research who was not involved in the original study, but who has relied on the underlying data for his own published research on tropical cyclone intensity.

Kossin agrees that today’s trends are likely consistent with his findings, particularly when looking at the global picture. With North Atlantic activity, though, it’s harder to extrapolate out as far into the future, he says. That’s partly because, since the 1970s, hurricane intensity in the region has soared due to both the increase in greenhouse gasses and the loss of pollution. Once the air is clean enough that pollution reduction is no longer a factor, North Atlantic hurricane intensity will be largely driven by one big question: how much greenhouse gas we choose to emit."
d5309d32-85ff-4fdb-94c7-75cc0398c28e,"It’s a question that follows any natural disaster, especially monster hurricanes like Ian: Was this caused by climate change?

When asked, scientists like Kevin Reed usually push back. Most researchers agree it’s not valid to point to a single storm and say it was “caused” by the warming world. Too many variables.

“That is a question that is really difficult to answer. There is no ‘what would have September 2022 looked like without climate change?’ We don’t have that,” said Reed, an associate professor in the school of marine and atmospheric sciences at Stony Brook University.

But there’s a growing consensus that the sea level rise and higher temperatures in the last hundred years have already impacted storms like Ian, which raked Florida last week, and may continue to do so in the future. At the very least, hotter weather means hotter oceans, which fuel hurricane strength.

“We live in a world that’s over 1 degree warmer (Celsius), there’s no doubt that hurricanes have changed in some respect because of climate change,” he said.

Tom Knutson, a senior scientist at NOAA studying climate and hurricanes, said scientists are most confident in noticing what’s changed about storms in the modern world. But less so about being able to connect those changes to climate change. Predicting what the future could hold is even tougher.

That’s because hurricanes and global weather patterns are devilishly complicated. Some of the changes in the atmosphere and storms, for example, can be attributed to the high levels of physical air pollution, beyond greenhouse gasses, spewed into the atmosphere.

Storm-tracking technology also has massively improved in recent centuries. Scientists agree we now are catching many more “junk storms” — short-lived and weak cyclones — than ever. That can skew data, which is why most scientists are cautious when drawing a direct line between a hotter globe and hurricanes numbers.

“It’s quite a complex picture and adding to the complexity, we’re inferring many of these things from climate models which themselves have uncertainty,” Knutson said. “We have to be careful.”

Here’s where the science stands on several fronts:

Higher storm surge likely

Sea levels near South Florida have already risen about eight inches since 1950, according to NOAA tidal gauge data. That means the water is starting from a higher base level, allowing hurricane surge to reach a few inches higher and cover more ground.

Researchers expect sea level rise to accelerate as hotter temperatures cause polar ice sheets to melt faster. Over the next century, South Florida can expect to see more than three feet of sea level rise, according to estimates from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

That will push storm surge higher when hurricanes roll through coastal communities. One 2020 study modeled what 21 hurricanes that struck between 2000 and 2013 might look like under the climate conditions expected in 2100. The researchers estimated that, on average, floods would have been about 30% worse and covered about a quarter more land.

More extreme rainfall

One of the most straightforward connections between climate change and hurricanes is rain. Like anyone who’s experienced humidity knows, warmer air holds more moisture.

For every 2 degrees Fahrenheit of warming, there is about 8% more water in the atmosphere, and the world has warmed at least 2 degrees Fahrenheit since pre-industrial times.

So perhaps it’s no surprise that one study of the 2020 hurricane season found an average 8% increase in three-day rainfall totals for hurricanes, and a 5% increase for tropical storms.

The lead author, Stony Brook’s Reed, said they also found that a hotter planet increased the rate of rainfall. In the 2020 season, three-hour rainfall rates would increase 10% or higher for tropical storms and hurricanes.

“If you experience a similar storm in the future it’s going to rain more because of climate change,” he said. “If you had 30 inches of rain, you could say over 2.5 inches of that rain was due to climate change, meaning it would not have rained as much if we hadn’t heated the planet.”

Reed and his colleagues also produced a rapid study of Hurricane Ian on Thursday that suggested a 10% increase in extreme rain rates due to human-caused climate change.

This body of research, known as attribution science, looks to answer the question of how climate change influenced a particular storm. In Reed’s case, he and his colleagues load up a powerful supercomputer weather model with the exact track and data from a modern-day storm, then re-set the clock back to the temperature and atmospheric conditions of the 1850s.

The clearest change they see is the storms are far less wet when set in the past.

Getting stronger faster

One of the most dangerous features of hurricanes is rapid intensification, which is when a storm’s top wind speeds increase 35 mph or more in a single day. It’s also difficult to predict so when a storm suddenly strengthens near the shore, coastal communities have little time to prepare or evacuate.

Early studies suggest climate change has already made rapid intensification more common. A 2021 IPCC report found that “the global frequency of (tropical cyclone) rapid intensification events has likely increased over the past four decades” and added that researchers have “medium confidence” that “none of these changes can be explained by natural variability alone.”

Researchers can say with much more certainty that the conditions that lead to rapid intensification are becoming more common. Sea surface temperatures are rising at a rate of 0.14 degrees Fahrenheit per decade, according to NOAA, and atmospheric moisture is increasing between 1% and 2% per decade, according to the IPCC. Both of these factors may give future hurricanes more fuel to turbocharge their growth.

Meanwhile, NOAA and Columbia University researchers predict that climate change will weaken vertical wind shear, an atmospheric feature that can pump the brakes on rapid intensification.

“We’ve seen multiple studies that show the conditions in the North Atlantic basin are providing more opportunities for storms to intensify,” said Kieran Bhatia, a former climate researcher at Princeton University who is now a vice president for the climate change perils advisory team at the insurance broker Guy Carpenter.

Fewer hurricanes but stronger

Climate change might make hurricanes more intense but less frequent.

Reliable global records of hurricane intensity only go back about four decades, when weather satellites began helping scientists to accurately estimate the strength of storms. In the years since, hurricanes appear to be getting stronger, according to a 2020 paper from researchers at NOAA and the University of Wisconsin. They found that the likelihood that a cyclone will reach Category 3 wind speeds — the threshold to be designated a “major hurricane” — has risen about 25% since 1979, as extra heat in the oceans and atmosphere gives storms more fuel to grow.

But even as climate change makes storms stronger, scientists believe it is weakening the ocean currents that help cyclones form in the first place — particularly the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), which pulls warm surface waters from the tropics across the Atlantic Ocean. The IPCC’s 2021 report says the AMOC , which also powers the Gulf Stream, is “very likely” to weaken over the 21st century.

As a result, hurricanes may become less frequent. A July paper published in Nature Climate Change estimated that tropical cyclones formed 13% less often in the 20th century than they did between 1850 and 1900. Although hurricane data before the satellite era is spotty, the international team of researchers combined real world observations with simulations from climate models to fill in the gaps and estimate the number of hurricanes that may have formed from 1850 to 2012. “A string of consecutive seasons with Category 5s, that’s something more consistent with what we’d expect in a warmer climate ... as opposed to a higher number of storms,” Brian Soden, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, told the Herald in 2020.

SLOWER AND WETTER STORMS Jim Kosin, a climate scientist at the NOAA Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies in Madison, Wisconsin, published a paper in 2018 that suggested that tropical storms and hurricanes around the world had slowed down about 10% between 1949 and 2016, and hit the brakes even harder over land. It was met with some criticism in the scientific community, but he followed it up with another research paper with NASA’s Timothy Hall in 2019 that narrowed in on the slowdown of storms near the North American coast since 1950. They found that hurricane forward speed has decreased since 1900, which can lead to even more rainfall and flooding as a storm stalls over land.

“More study is needed to determine how much more slowing will occur with continued warming. Still, it’s entirely plausible that local rainfall increases could actually be dominated by this slowdown rather than the expected rain-rate increases due to global warming,” Kossin told a NOAA blog. Knutson, with NOAA, called it “the most convincing evidence of a trend I’ve seen so far.” But he cautioned that just because the trend was observed doesn’t automatically mean climate change is to blame. “That’s an open research question.”

More landfalls may be in the future

In the past, many storms at sea went undetected unless reported by vessels unlucky enough to encounter them. But good records go back a century or more on ones that make shore. New research by Knutson, based on running past data into a computer model, projects what might happen to hurricane paths in the future if global warming continues unchecked. He found that while the number of storms making landfall hasn’t really changed that much in the last century, an increasing fraction could in the future could.

Combined with other research suggesting that fewer but more powerful storms could form in the future, Knutson said his findings suggest that cities are in for fewer, but increasingly intense hits.

“It’s kind of several effects cutting in different directions,” he said. Ever the careful scientist, Knutson also cautioned that his work was only a prediction. “That’s in the model. We’ll see what happens in the real world,” he said.

The event addressed the conflict situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and its links to climate security.

The DRC is a country with the potential to play a pivotal role in international climate and environmental protection and with experience of ongoing conflict dynamics and climate change. This made PRECOP27 Kinshasa an important opportunity to discuss the nexus between security and climate change.

The event aimed to foster dialogue by bringing national, regional and international experts together to discuss the challenges of the global climate transition and the risks and opportunities of this transition for countries like the DRC. The event sought to identify recommendations for climate-sensitive actions that have the potential to transform conflict.

The side event opened with a keynote address by Jennifer Lee Morgan, German State Secretary and Special Envoy for International Climate Action, followed by a high-level panel discussion on the interconnection between climate security and the conflict situation in the DRC. The thematic workshops discussed specific aspects of climate and security in the context of the DRC: minerals and exploitation, protection of the rainforest, and national parks.

The meeting comes within the framework of painstaking efforts exerted by Egypt ahead of the global climate conference, which will be held in the Red Sea resort city of Sharm El Sheikh in November, said Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ahmed Abu Zeid.

PRECOP27 will be hosted by the Congolese capital of Kinshasa on 3-4 October with the attendance of more than 50 climate Ministers for a last consultative round ahead of COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh city.

The meeting is set to focus on the main issues that will be tackled during COP27, including efforts to reduce carbon emissions, climate change adaptation, climate finance, and the adverse impacts of climate change, added the spokesman.

On the sidelines of the meeting, Shoukry is scheduled to attend the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF), according to the spokesman.

The Egyptian top diplomat will also hold bilateral meetings with a host of ministers and envoys concerned with the climate issue.

Shoukry is also scheduled to meet with a number of Congolese officials to discuss relations between the two countries.

Egypt is preparing to host COP27 between 6 and 18 November and has been keen to build on the success of Glasgow summit (COP26) in a bid to turn climate pledges into actions.

The African country has repeatedly affirmed that it will speak for Africa’s aspirations regarding the climate file, with African countries being the most affected with climate change impacts despite being a small contributor to these effects.

Host nation DR Congo on Monday urged rich countries in particular to increase funding to combat climate change during the final meeting ahead of the COP27 climate summit in Egypt next month.

Congolese Environment Minister Eve Bazaiba called on countries to respect past financial pledges and also to endorse proposals to compensate less developed economies for climate-inflicted damage.

""Unless a global effort is made ... no one will escape,"" Bazaiba said in Kinshasa. ""We all breathe the same air.""

Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry stressed the need for more money, specifically mentioning a promise originally dating back to COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009, to provide developing countries with $100 billion (€101.7 billion) per year for projects to combat climate change.

Bazaiba argued that such investments should no longer be classified as development aid by wealthier nations but rather as an investment in humanity's future.

Deputy UN Secretary-General Amina Mohammed warned that ""all indicators on climate are heading in the wrong direction.""

UN's Guterres calls for 'quantum compromise'

Addressing the informal summit via video link from the UN's main buildings in New York City, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for a ""quantum level compromise"" between wealthy countries responsible for much of humanity's carbon emissions and poorer countries that often feel climate change's effects most profoundly.

Guterres listed recent natural disasters and other climatic difficulties around the world, saying humanity faced ""a life-or-death struggle for our own safety today and our survival tomorrow.""

""A third of Pakistan flooded. Europe's hottest summer in 500 years. The Philippines hammered. The whole of Cuba in black-out. And here, in the United States, Hurricane Ian has delivered a brutal reminder that no country and no economy is immune from the climate crisis,"" Guterres said.

Delegates from 50 countries are attending the talks preparing for the major UN summit in Sharm el-Sheikh from November 6-18, including the US's climate envoy John Kerry, who was scheduled to hold talks with Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi on Tuesday.

The hosts' Environment Minister Bazaiba told Reuters news agency before the talks that because ""the G20 is responsible for 80% of the pollution in the world, ... the real debate of this pre-COP and COP27 is the responsibility of the polluting countries.""

Both Guterres and his deputy Amina Mohammed made similar comments on Monday, with the UN's top official saying commitments from the G20 group of the world's biggest economic powers ""are coming far too little, and far too late.""

Delegates at the last COP26 summit in Glasgow had sought action on a mechanism for richer countries to pay compensation for damages attributable to climate change. But richer countries balked at the suggestion and instead a pledge to start a ""dialogue"" on the issue was made.

Congo defends fossil fuel extraction closer to home

Congo is arguing that it can be a ""solution country"" for climate change by protecting its vast rainforests, which act as a carbon sink.

But the central African nation also defended its controversial auction of various oil and gas exploration rights last year — ignoring environmentalists' objections — saying that they could alleviate poverty.

""What should we do in this circumstance,"" Environment Minister Bazaiba asked, ""let our children and small children die of hunger? As much as we need oxygen, we also need bread.""

Congo has also said it will try to minimize the environmental impact by using modern drilling methods and tight regulation.

Probably the main outcome of the previous COP was the pledge to try to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius versus pre-industrial era levels. Egypt has said the main focus of COP27 should be on implementing this pledge.

10d8c9d0-3b5f-4059-87bb-6008b8fe7b5e,"Climate change once seemed a distant threat. No more. We now know its face, and all too well. We see it in every hurricane, torrential rainstorm, flood, heatwave, wildfire and drought. It’s even detectable in our daily weather. Climate disruption has changed the background conditions in which all weather occurs: the oceans and air are warmer, there’s more water vapor in the atmosphere and sea levels are higher. Hurricane Ian is the latest example.

Ian made landfall as one of the five most powerful hurricanes in recorded history to strike the US, and with its 150 mile per hour winds at landfall, it tied with 2004’s Hurricane Charley as the strongest to ever hit the west coast of Florida. In isolation, that might seem like something we could dismiss as an anomaly or fluke. But it’s not – it’s part of a larger pattern of stronger hurricanes, typhoons and superstorms that have emerged as the oceans continue to set record levels of warmth.

Many of the storms of the past five years – Harvey, Maria, Florence, Michael, Ida and Ian – aren’t natural disasters so much as human-made disasters, whose amplified ferocity is fueled by the continued burning of fossil fuels and the increase in heat-trapping carbon pollution, a planet-warming “greenhouse gas”.

No amount of adaptation can shield [us] from the devastating consequences of the continued warming of our planet

This Atlantic hurricane season, although it started out slow, has heated up, thanks to unusually warm ocean waters. Fiona hit Puerto Rico as a category 1 hurricane (subsequently strengthening to a powerful category 4 storm), and hundreds of thousands of people there are still without power. The storm barreled on into the open Atlantic, eventually making landfall in the maritime provinces to become Canada’s strongest ever storm. Then came Ian, which feasted on a deep layer of very warm water in the Gulf of Mexico.

Human-caused warming is not just heating the surface of the oceans; the warmth is diffusing down into the depths of the ocean, leading to year after year of record ocean heat content. That means that storms are less likely to churn up colder waters from below, inhibiting one of the natural mechanisms that dampen strengthening. It also leads to the sort of rapid intensification we increasingly see with these storms, where they balloon into major hurricanes in a matter of hours.

Too often we still hear, even from government scientists, the old saw that we cannot link individual hurricanes to climate change. There was a time when climate scientists believed that to be true. But they don’t any more. We have developed powerful tools to attribute the degree to which global warming affects extreme events. One study found, for example, that the devastating flooding from Hurricane Florence as it made landfall in North Carolina four years ago was as much as 50% greater and 80km (50 miles) larger due to the warmer ocean.

We can also draw upon basic physics, as we explained in Scientific American in 2017. Warmer oceans mean more fuel to strengthen hurricanes, with an average increase in wind speeds of major hurricanes of about 18mph for each 1C (1.8F) of ocean surface warming, a roughly 13% increase. Since the power of the storm increases roughly the wind speed not only squared but raised to the third power, that amounts to a roughly 44% increase in the destructive potential of these storms.

There is also evidence that human-caused warming is increasing the size of these storms. All else being equal, larger storms pile up greater amounts of water, leading to larger storm surges like the 12 to 18 feet estimated for Ian in some locations. Add sea level rise, and that’s the better part of foot of additional coastal flooding baked into every single storm surge. If humanity continues to warm the planet, and destabilize the Greenland and west Antarctic ice sheets, we could see yards, not feet, of eventual sea-level rise. Think of that as a perpetual coastal flooding event.

Then there is the flooding rainfall, like the 20 inches (50cm) of it we’re seeing across a large swath of Florida with Ian. Simple physics tells us that the amount of moisture that evaporates off the ocean into the atmosphere increases about 7% for each 1C of ocean surface warming. That means 7% more moisture to turn into flooding rains. But that’s not the whole story. Stronger storms can entrain more moisture into them – a double whammy that produced the record flooding we saw in Philadelphia a year ago with Hurricane Ida, and the flooding we saw with Harvey in Texas in 2017 and Florence in the Carolinas in 2018, the two worst flooding events on record in the US.

Tampa’s wide shallow coastal shelf, low topography combined with rising sea levels and vulnerable infrastructure make it particularly vulnerable to a landfalling major hurricane. Tampa Bay has dodged multiple bullets in recent years in the form of major hurricanes that ultimately weakened or swerved away from the city. Ian is the latest example, as it passed to the east rather than to the west of Tampa Bay, sparing the sprawling urban population a devastating storm surge that would have flooded the homes of millions.

Unfortunately, Tampa’s luck will eventually run out. We must prepare for the inevitable calamity that will occur when the city is at the receiving end of a losing roll of the weather dice.

It is important to take steps to increase resilience and adapt to the changes that are inevitable, taking all of the precautions we can to spare our coasts from the devastating consequences of sea-level rise combined with stronger, more damaging hurricanes. But no amount of adaptation can shield Florida, or anywhere else, from the devastating consequences of the continued warming of our planet.

Only mitigation – the dramatic reduction of heat-trapping pollution – can prevent things from getting worse. We’ve seen some progress on that front recently, both in the US and globally. The climate provisions of the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act are a great start, but they’re not adequate on their own for the US to meet its obligations to cut carbon emissions in half by 2030.

We need more aggressive climate action to pass Congress. And that means we need politicians who are willing to support that action, rather than act as apologists for powerful fossil fuel interests. That’s something for all Americans to think about as they go to the voting booths in a matter of weeks.

A massive clean-up has begun in Florida, and North and South Carolina, after Hurricane Ian cut a swathe of destruction that left at least 21 people dead.

Ian is one of the most powerful storms ever to hit the U.S. mainland and has caused tens of billions of dollars in damage.

New images from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration show beach cottages and a motel building that lined the shores of Florida’s Sanibel Island now wiped away by the storm surge.

The popular destination for holidaymakers and retirees was cut off when a causeway was rendered impassable.

With a population of about 10,000, the town is a tourist destination known for its oak-lined streets and more than 50 sites on the National Registry of Historic Places.

The town was heavily damaged by 1989’s Hurricane Hugo.

We've started flying over communities affected by Hurricane Ian to assess the damage.

Ian is now a post-tropical cyclone, weakening but still forecast to bring treacherous conditions to parts of the United States on Saturday (local time) including the Carolinas, Virginia and West Virginia.

“Major to record river flooding will continue across central Florida through next week, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.

“Limited flash, urban and small stream flooding is possible across the central Appalachians and the southern Mid-Atlantic this weekend, with minor river flooding expected over the coastal Carolinas.”

The storm struck Florida’s Gulf Coast on Wednesday, turning beach towns into disaster areas.

On Friday, it pummelled waterfront Georgetown, north of the historic city of Charleston in South Carolina, with wind speeds of 140km/h.

Roads were flooded and blocked by trees while a number of piers were damaged.

More than 1.7 million homes and businesses were without power in the Carolinas and Florida on Saturday, according to the tracking website PowerOutage.us.

Both the number of casualties and repair costs remain unclear, but the extent of the damage was becoming apparent as Florida entered its third day after Ian first hit.

There have been reports of at least 21 deaths in Florida, Kevin Guthrie, director of the state’s Division of Emergency Management, said, stressing that some of those remained unconfirmed.

Some 10,000 people were unaccounted for, he said, but many of them were likely in shelters or without power.

“Those older homes that just aren’t as strong built, they got washed into the sea,” Governor Ron DeSantis said.

“If you are hunkering down in that, that is something that I think would be very difficult to be survivable.”

Insurers are bracing for a hit of between $44 billion and $73 billion in what could be the costliest Florida storm since Hurricane Andrew in 1992, according to US property data and analytics company CoreLogic.

US President Joe Biden has approved a disaster declaration, making federal resources available to counties impacted by the storm.

“We’re just beginning to see the scale of that destruction. It’s likely to rank among the worst … in the nation’s history,” he said.

President Biden also declared an emergency in North Carolina.

9ab57ecc-ca51-47e0-8212-e0c32d82b290,"Human-induced climate change increased the extreme rainfall brought by Hurricane Ian, which has devastated parts of Florida, by more than 10%, according to a new preliminary analysis.

Ian has caused widespread damage and at least 21 deaths since crunching into south-west Florida on Wednesday, tearing asunder cities such as Fort Myers and Cape Coral with winds that reached close to 150mph and a storm surge that in places reached 18ft. More than 2 million people have been left without power as the storm has rampaged across the state and moved northwards to the Carolinas.

Much of the damage has been due to torrential rainfall, with the new analysis finding that the heating of the atmosphere and ocean due to human activity has added significantly to the intensity of these downpours.

The study, which is preliminary and yet to be peer reviewed, found that the amount of rain dumped by the storm was 10% higher because of the climate crisis. Scientists used a methodology established in previous research that rainfall during the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season was up to 11% heavier due to global heating.

“That sort of increase in rainfall isn’t small when it’s on top of an already intense storm,” said Kevin Reed, a researcher at Stony Brook University who undertook the new work. “It can really have significant effects, as we’ve seen with the extensive rainfall across Florida. It has had a widespread effect.

“If you’ve got 1ft in rainfall over a day, 10% more adds an inch or so more, which is a lot in itself. It can really amplify the impacts.”

The heating of the atmosphere, through the burning of fossil fuels, has caused it to accumulate more water in many places – about 7% more water for every extra 1C (1.8F) it warms. This can then be unleashed in heavy precipitation events that can quickly inundate houses and businesses.

“These are conservative estimates on the human-induced increases in rain using our peer-reviewed method,” said Michael Wehner, a climate scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory who worked on the new analysis with Reed. “Climate change didn’t cause the storm but it did cause it to be wetter.”

Hurricanes derive much of their strength from heat in the ocean, and the Gulf of Mexico’s water temperature is about 0.8C (1.4F) above the long-term normal, leading scientists to point to a trend of storms rapidly gathering pace, in part due to global heating.

In the case of Ian, what was a tropical storm morphed into a hurricane in less than 24 hours, ballooning further into something that was near to a category 5 storm, the fiercest category of storm, which has winds powerful enough to rip roofs off buildings. This sort of rapid intensification has happened several times in recent years alone the US Gulf coast, such as Hurricane Ida, which caused widespread chaos in Louisiana last year.

“We are seeing much clearer indicators in these events, for sure,” Reed said. “It’s a good reminder that while we’ve had a relatively quiet hurricane season until this storm, we still have two months of the season left and we need to be really prepared.

“The reality is that climate change is here, and it’s altering events here and around the world. It’s important that we realize this when we think about disasters like this.”"
99e5f61c-5dd1-4291-9cc7-6bd70d926011,"“We absolutely expect to have mortality from this hurricane,” DeSantis said. “Just caution, people, there’s a process by where that is confirmed.” He added that “people have said certain things” about casualties that are “not something that has been confirmed at this juncture.”

His comments came after President Joe Biden earlier in the day had said early reports indicate that Ian caused substantial loss of life, saying that “this could be the deadliest hurricane in Florida history.” Florida’s deadliest hurricane on record was the 1928 Okeechobee storm, which killed more than 2,500 in the state.

The sheriff of Lee County, Carmine Marceno, told “Good Morning America” early Thursday morning that fatalities “are in the hundreds.”

Ian, which made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane, unleashed winds of 150 mph when it crashed ashore Wednesday, causing what DeSantis described as a “500-year flood event.” At least 15,000 people were sheltering in place during the storm. Before it made landfall, more than 2.5 million people were under evacuation orders. Nearly 2.5 million people remain without power on Thursday night, though at least 500,000 had power restored.

Floodwaters in some of the hardest-hit areas surpassed 6 feet; videos on social media depicted water bursting through doors and swelling to the second story of homes. Chunks of bridges crumbled into the water, and massive trees fell, contributing to the power outages across the state.

“Lee and Charlotte [counties] are basically off the grid at this point,” DeSantis said Thursday during an earlier press briefing.

DeSantis said the state launched efforts to rescue possibly thousands of people stranded in their homes by the historic flooding. Biden also declared a major disaster in Florida, which brings with it federal aid to supplement state, local and tribal recovery efforts in areas affected by the storm.

“You’re looking at a storm that’s changed the character of a significant part of our state,” DeSantis said. “And this is going to require not just emergency response now in the days or weeks ahead — this is going to require years of efforts to be able to rebuild and come back.”

DeSantis remained optimistic that rescue efforts could reach people stranded by floodwaters.

“We’re obviously hoping that they can be rescued at this point, and I know the folks there locally, those are the areas they want to spring into action to,” DeSantis said.

About 28 Chinook helicopters are performing rescue missions in the hardest-hit areas. The state also deployed 100 engineers to survey damage to bridges, including the Sanibel Causeway and Pine Island Bascule Bridge, which are not passable, DeSantis said.

By Thursday night, the storm had moved into the Atlantic east of Florida and was heading toward Georgia and the Carolinas. It also strengthed back into a hurricane.

In one hospital system in the badly-hit Lee County, Ian shut down the public water supply and caused rampant power outages. Florida Hospital Association CEO Mary Mayhew said Lee Health, which includes the Lee Memorial Hospital in Fort Myers, had to evacuate 1,000 patients on Thursday starting at daybreak. The statewide medical community descended on the area as rescuers moved patients to facilities outside the area that were willing to help.

The governor and Biden spoke Thursday morning about the storm after Biden declared Ian a major disaster, opening up more aid for the state and individual assistance to residents of nine counties. Biden also spoke with Cecil Pendergrass, a commissioner in Lee County.

Biden will send FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell to Florida on Friday to “check in” on the response and gauge where Florida needs more support. “The President and Governor committed to continued close coordination,” White House officials said in a readout of the call.

The federal assistance released by the president could include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low cost loans to cover uninsured property loss and other programs to assist with disaster-recovery.

Criswell said Thursday that “we have some reports on fatalities” in Lee County, including from the sheriff, and that “they expect the number to go up.”

“What I know right now is Lee County was basically ground zero for the impacts that were seen from Hurricane Ian,” Criswell said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” “And we know that we are going to have catastrophic impacts to that area.”

The FEMA administrator said officials would gather post-storm imagery as soon as it’s safe to fly to further assess the greatest areas of impact and “get boots on the ground in the areas of greatest need.”

The White House said in its disaster declaration that damage assessments are continuing in other areas of the state, ”and additional areas may be designated for assistance after the assessments are fully completed.”

Biden’s approval comes a day after DeSantis officially requested the disaster declaration for the entire state. The entire Florida congressional delegation also wrote to Biden in support of DeSantis’ request.

“This historic hurricane will continue to impact the state for some time, and the full extent of damage will not be known for days. However, approving this declaration request will allow Floridians to be better prepared for the recovery phase,” the lawmakers said in a letter, led by Republican Sens. Marco Rubio and Rick Scott.

The state activated 5,000 National Guard troops to assist in the recovery efforts. At least 40,000 workers were on standby to help restore power.

About 3,000 rescue efforts were underway in Lee County, Scott said Thursday. In Naples, Scott said, the “whole city” was flooded, with water “from the bay to the gulf,” and local first responders already lost two brand new fire trucks in the flooding.

“So the process right now — unfortunately, I’ve done this enough times I can tell you the process — first thing you got to keep everybody safe, you got to rescue everybody,” Scott said.

Karen Baughman, 81, of Fort Myers, couldn’t evacuate her home before the hurricane struck and was hunkered down in her home on Wednesday. She said she felt safe and didn’t have any flooding in her neighborhood.

“I’ve been through three hurricanes here and only once did I have to go to a shelter,” she said in an interview. “My home felt safe. It’s always sounded worse — the predictions — than it’s been. And I didn’t really know where I would go.”

Global average per-capita emissions reached about 6 tonnes of carbon-dioxyde equivalent (tCO 2 e) in 2019. To have high chances of staying below +1.5 °C global temperature increase, average per-capita emissions should be 1.9 tCO 2 e between now and 2050 (that is, the equivalent of an economy-class round-trip flight between London and New York) and zero afterwards (Supplementary Information section 3).

Inequalities in average per-capita emissions ‘between’ world regions remain large, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 1. On top of these gaps, important inequalities in carbon footprints are observed within regions. Figure 1 presents the carbon footprints of the bottom 50% of emitters, the middle 40% and the top 10% of the population within regions according to my benchmark results. Emission levels and shares for other groups are presented in Supplementary Information (section 7).

Fig. 1: Per-capita emissions by group in 2019 (tCO 2 e per capita). Per-capita emissions include emissions from domestic consumption, public and private investments, and imports and exports of carbon embedded in goods and services traded with the rest of the world. Benchmark scenario with modelled estimates is based on the systematic combination of tax data, household surveys and input-output tables. Emissions are split equally within households. Error bars show estimates for extreme scenarios (with α = 0.4 in one case and α = 0.8 in the other). MENA refers to Middle-East North Africa. Source and series: see Methods and Supplementary Information sections 5–7. Source data Full size image

In East Asia, the poorest 50% emit on average 2.9 tCO 2 e per annum, while the middle 40% emit nearly 8 t, and the top 10% almost 40 t. This contrasts sharply with North America, where the bottom 50% emit fewer than 10 t, the middle 40% around 22 t and the top 10% around 69 tCO 2 e. This in turn can be contrasted with the emissions in Europe, where the bottom 50% emit 5 t, the middle 40% around 10.5 tCO 2 e and the top 10% around 30 tCO 2 e. Emission levels in South and Southeast Asia are notably lower than in the other regions, from around 1 tCO 2 e for the bottom 50% to 11 t on average for the top 10%.

It is striking that the poorest half of the population in the United States has emission levels comparable with the European middle 40%, despite being almost twice as poor as this group in purchasing power parity terms17. Conversely, the top 10% of the population in East Asia emits notably more than its European counterpart (40 tCO 2 e vs 29 tCO 2 e, respectively). It also appears that Russia and Central Asia have an emissions distribution broadly similar to that of Europe, but with higher top 10% emissions (mainly due to higher income and wealth inequalities in Russia and Central Asia) and lower bottom 50% emissions. Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind, with the bottom 50% emitting around 0.5 t per capita and per year, and the top 10% emitting around 7.5 t.

Global carbon inequality between individuals

Figure 2 presents the inequality of carbon emissions between individuals at the world level. The global bottom 50% emit on average 1.4 tCO 2 e per year and contribute to 11.5% of the total. The middle 40% emit 6.1 t on average, making up 40.5% of the total. The top 10% emit 28.7 t (48% of the total). The top 1% emits 101 t (16.9% of the total). Global carbon emissions inequality thus appears to be great: close to half of all emissions are released by one-tenth of the global population, and just one-hundredth of the world population (77 million individuals) emits about 50% more than the entire bottom half of the population (3.8 billion individuals).

The evolution of individual carbon emission inequalities

How has global emissions inequality changed over the past few decades? In Fig. 3a, global polluters are ranked from the least emitting to the highest on the X axis, and their per-capita emissions growth rate between 1990 and 2019 is presented on the Y axis. Since 1990, average global emissions per capita grew by 2.3% (and overall emissions grew by about 50%, see Supplementary Information Table 6.1). The per-capita emissions of the bottom 50% grew faster than the average (26%), while those of the middle 40% as a whole was negative (−1.2%), and some percentiles of the global distribution actually saw a reduction in their emissions of between 5 and 25%. Per-capita emissions of the top 1% emissions grew by 26% and top 0.01% emissions by 80%. One striking result shown in Fig. 3a is the reduction in the emissions of about 5–15% for percentiles p75 to p95. This segment of the world population largely corresponds to the lower- and middle-income groups of the rich countries and contrasts with the emissions of the top 1%, which have markedly increased.

Personal carbon footprints include emissions from domestic consumption, public and private investments, as well as imports and exports of carbon embedded in goods and services traded with the rest of the world. Modelled estimates are based on the systematic combination of tax data, household surveys and input-output tables. Benchmark scenario.

Dotted lines represent scenarios with α = 0.4 and α = 0.8. Source and series: Author, see Methods and Supplementary Information sections 5–7. Source data Full size image

Per-capita emissions matter but understanding the contribution of each group to the overall share of total emissions growth is also crucial. The bottom half of the global population actually contributed only 16% of the growth in emissions observed since then, while the top 1% (77 million individuals in 2019) was responsible for 23% of total emissions growth. The top 0.1% (7.7 million individuals in 2019) contributed about two-thirds of the entire growth in emissions associated with the poorest half of the global population (3,855 million individuals in 2019). Supplementary Information Table 7.1 presents the evolution of the Theil and Gini indices of global emissions inequality.

Global carbon inequality dynamics are governed by two forces: the evolution of average emission levels ‘between’ countries and the evolution of emission inequalities ‘within’ countries. Which of these two forces has been driving the dynamics of global carbon inequality over the past few decades? Fig. 3b compares the share of global emissions due to within-country differences with the between-country differences using a Theil-index decomposition. In 1990, most global carbon inequality (62%) was due to differences between countries in my benchmark estimates: back then, the average citizen of a rich country polluted unequivocally more than the rest of the world, and income inequalities within countries were on average lower across the globe than today. The situation has entirely reversed in 30 years. Within-country emission inequalities now account for nearly two-thirds of global emissions inequality. To be clear: this does not mean that important inequalities in emissions between countries and regions have disappeared. On the contrary, it means that on top of the great inter-national inequality in carbon emissions, there are also even greater emission inequalities between individuals within countries. To provide another insight into this result, Fig. 4ab presents a geographical breakdown of global emitter groups: it reveals that top global emitters come from all world regions.

GHG emissions measured correspond to individual footprints, that is, they include indirect emissions produced abroad and embedded in individual consumption.

Investments and the carbon footprints of wealthy individuals

In the framework developed, personal carbon footprints can be split into emissions generated by private consumption, investments and government spending. Consumption-related emissions come from the carbon released by the direct use of energy (for example, fuel in a car) or its indirect use (for example, energy embedded in the production of goods and services consumed by individuals). Investment-related emissions are emissions associated with choices made by capital owners about investments in the production process (that is, emissions involved in the construction of machines, factories and so on). Emissions from government spending correspond to collective consumption expenditure or investments (government administration, public roads, defense, etc.).

Focusing on the breakdown between consumption and investment emissions, I find that the bulk of the emissions generated by the global top 1% comes from their investments rather than their consumption (Fig. 5b) (over 70% in 2019 in the benchmark scenario). The weight of investments in the per-capita footprint of the top groups has been rising since the 1990s. This appears to be due to the rise in overall emissions associated with investments over the period (Supplementary Table 1.1) as well as to the rise in wealth inequality: wealth and investments are more concentrated today than they were in 1990 in many countries."
4636f9f9-83a0-43d5-a6a0-a83f78b243a2,"All humans contribute to climate change. Net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reached an equivalent of 7.8 tons of carbon dioxide (tCO 2 e) per person in 2019 (ref. 1). To limit global warming to 2 °C, emissions have to fall by more than 60% by 2050. But not all humans contribute equally. Emissions in North America are more than twice the global average, at 19 tCO 2 e per person, while emissions in Africa are around half the global average, at 4 tCO 2 e per person1. These figures hide large differences within regions. Knowing who is responsible for GHG emissions can inform targeted climate policy and tell us who bears the cost of emissions cuts. Now, writing in Nature Sustainability, Lucas Chancel2 quantifies carbon footprints worldwide, finding high and persistent inequality."

NATO Asserts Sabotage in Damage to Nord Stream Pipelines

Commentary

Using a language, tone, and tenor not seen in many years, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) released a statement on the damage to the Nord Stream pipelines in the Baltic Sea. In the release, NATO cites that willful sabotage was the likely cause, but didn’t affix blame on a nation or group. Voice of America added the interpretation that NATO “vowed retaliation” over this episode.

The situation is fraught with questions of motive, intent, and capability of the perpetrators. Much of this evolving situation doesn’t make sense, and more must be revealed to fully understand the who, how, and why of this dramatic event.

The Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines have been prominently in the news since the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine. Inexplicably, Europe continues to consume vast quantities of Russian gas and oil, while reducing their domestic energy options and declining to seek expanded energy options from the United States.

The Nord Stream pipelines are the most efficient and direct ways for Russia to provide gas to Germany. Nord Stream 1 has been in operation since 2011. Nord Stream 2, which doubles the capacity, was subject to opposition from the Trump administration, while the Biden administration caused considerable confusion by waiving sanctions against this pipeline in May 2021. As the Ukrainian conflict began to develop in February, President Joe Biden made comments about stopping Nord Stream 2 if necessary.

Tremors Detected

The breaks in the two pipelines (now apparently at four locations) appear to be to the southeast and northeast of Bornholm, a Danish island to the east of Denmark, in between Sweden and Poland, and at the point where both pipelines turn to the southwest in their final run to Germany.

The force of each blast that is thought to have damaged the pipelines was estimated at more than 1,000 pounds of explosives, based on seismic readings. For comparative purposes, that’s the equivalent of four large aircraft-dropped bombs (which is likely beyond the ability of scuba divers to transport and place).

The waters where the breaks occurred appear to be in the 200- to 300-foot range. The depths of the last leg of the pipelines as they turn toward Germany from Bornholm are much shallower, and the preponderance of the Baltic Sea traffic transiting the area seems to run on the north/northwest side of Bornholm, according to the Baltic Sea traffic system.

Remotely operated undersea drones have become routine for any construction, inspection, or recovery below shallow scuba depth. These are often deployed by nondescript, oceangoing work vessels to support commercial, scientific, or military projects.

The NATO statement cites that the attack was conducted against “critical infrastructure.” Another way to attack critical infrastructure is through the cyber domain. Cyber capabilities can often be projected through the remote maintenance monitoring equipment that’s normally part of most critical infrastructure. The ability to reach in and essentially destroy critical infrastructure through cyber methods was demonstrated in the Stuxnet attack on the Iranian nuclear efforts.

Recent Surge of NATO Naval Presence in Baltics

Recently (in August and September), the USS Kearsarge amphibious ready group (ARG) was in the Baltic Sea. This naval task force conducted operations with Finnish forces and visited the three Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Then, the Kearsarge ARG conducted training with Swedish military units, and it just recently exited the Baltic, going right past Bornholm and the area of the sabotage, and appears to currently be somewhere around Great Britain.

The USS Kearsarge is essentially a medium-sized aircraft carrier, in other words, a very large warship. The Russians have a large enclave in Kaliningrad on the Baltic coast (between Poland and Lithuania) and come to high alert when NATO surges resources in the Baltic.

Kaliningrad has been held by the Russians since the end of World War II. The Russians consider this enclave both sacred (they have vowed to always occupy this cut-off region due to the perception that this is the historic birthplace of Prussianism) as well as strategic, and they allegedly keep nuclear missiles here, a sore point with NATO.

The Russians become agitated whenever NATO projects military forces around Kaliningrad. The NATO surge of forces, essentially simultaneously with the Nord Stream attacks, adds to the questions around this episode.

There are clearly more questions than answers now, and more are likely to emerge from the high-stakes drama unfolding in the Baltic.

a839b404-de8d-4a39-9426-d5a5c4c05b36,"WHITEHORSE, YT, Nov. 25, 2022 /CNW/ - Fighting climate change and protecting communities from the damages of wildfire has never been more important. As part of Canada's National Adaptation Strategy, communities from coast to coast to coast are developing tools and programs to increase resilience to climate change impacts while investing in clean solutions.

Today, Brendan Hanley, Member of Parliament for Yukon, on behalf of the Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, Minister of Natural Resources, announced $3.5 million in support for the Yukon First Nations Wildfire project for training 10 instructors and 120 wildland firefighters under the Indigenous Firefighter and Multi-Hazard Training Initiative. This pilot project will support the Yukon First Nations Wildfire's vision to incorporate traditional Indigenous knowledge in wildland firefighting and help to inform the Wildfire Training Program.

Support for the Yukon First Nations Wildfire project is built on investments in Budget 2022, which provided Natural Resources Canada with $37.9 million over five years to train 1,000 firefighters and incorporate Indigenous traditional knowledge in fire management under the Fighting and Managing Wildfires in a Changing Climate Program.

Working with Indigenous organizations to develop and expand the employment and training supports to a broader range of recipients will build wildfire response capacity across Canada and inform the establishment of a responsive and inclusive-by-design Wildfire Training program. The Wildfire Training program will be fully launched in 2024–2025.

Yesterday, in Prince Edward Island, the Honourable Bill Blair, President of the King's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Emergency Preparedness, on behalf of the Honourable Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Environment and Climate Change, released Canada's first-ever National Adaptation Strategy: Building Resilient Communities and a Strong Economy.

Following this, the Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, Minister of Natural Resources, also highlighted new funding that is being provided to three federal programs that form part of the Action Plan and will be delivered by Natural Resources Canada for Canadians across the country: a Flood Hazard Identification and Mapping Program, a Wildfire Resilient Futures Initiative and a Climate Resilient Coastal and Northern Communities Program.

Story continues

The National Adaptation Strategy establishes a common direction for preparing for climate change events across five key systems: disaster resilience; health and well-being; nature and biodiversity; infrastructure; and economy and workers.

The Strategy is now open to the provinces, territories and National Indigenous Organizations for a final 90 days of engagement on the Strategy's common goals and specific measurable targets and objectives. The Strategy is a result of extensive engagement since 2021 and presents a shared vision for climate resilience in the country and a framework to measure progress nationally.

Making adaptation investments now will have major economy-wide benefits later. Expert research suggests that every dollar invested in prevention and preparation can save up to $15 in costs. Adapting to climate change requires that all orders of government, the private sector and Canadians work together to build resilient communities and a stronger economy, ultimately ensuring Canadians continue to thrive into the future.

The Canadian government on Thursday unveiled a CAN$1.6 billion (US$1.2 billion) plan to help the country deal with the looming dangers of a warming world, such as floods, wildfires and extreme heat.

The so-called climate adaptation strategy will fund programs to help Canadians shield themselves from heat waves, protect coastlines from rising seas and safeguard infrastructure, including in the far north, which is facing the thaw of permafrost, officials said.

""Climate change is hitting all communities right across Canada,"" Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair told a news conference from Prince Edward Island, a province hit hard by Hurricane Fiona in September.

The storm—said to be the costliest to hit Canada's Atlantic coast—was just a taste of what's to come, according to the government, which forecasts annual costs of natural disasters in Canada to rise to Can$15.4 billion by 2030.

""We are seeing in the last few years, not just in Canada but around the world, an increase in the frequency and severity of climate related events,"" said Blair, citing extreme weather events that killed hundreds and devastated communities across the country.

The adaptation strategy, which the government presented as a work-in-progress, was hailed as a ""great step forward"" by Greenpeace, while the Insurance Bureau of Canada, which represents home, car and business insurers, called it ""ambitious.""

Its goals also include making Canadians more aware of the risks of natural disasters in their communities, establishing 15 new urban national parks, conserving 30 percent of Canada's lands and waters to stem biodiversity loss, and preventing all future deaths from extreme heat.

Adaptation measures, according to a government statement, could result in up to Can$15 in savings for every dollar spent.

New construction standards in fire and flood zones alone would save an estimated Can$4.7 billion a year, the government said, while noting that urban forests in Toronto—Canada's largest city—have lowered cooling costs, improved air quality and reduced strains on stormwater sewers.

The new funding builds on more than Can$8 billion already committed by Ottawa for adaptation and disaster relief since 2009.

A fraught United Nations climate summit wrapped up on Sunday with a landmark deal on funding to help vulnerable countries cope with devastating climate impacts.

But it failed to push ahead on further cutting emissions in order to keep alive the aspirational goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels.

Feds to Spend $1.6 Billion on New National Climate Adaptation Strategy

The federal government has announced it will spend $1.6 billion on its newly unveiled “National Adaptation Strategy,” which it says is a commitment to a “whole-of-society approach” to tackling climate change.

The funding will go to local communities for the purpose of reinforcing infrastructure, such as bridges and roads, so that communities can survive “extreme weather events” like forest fires and floods.

It will also “enable engagement and work with Indigenous communities on the development of region-specific health initiatives linked to changing climate conditions,” the government said in a statement on Nov. 24.

The funding announcement comes along with existing federal commitments to spend over $8 billion on climate adaption measures, including natural disaster response measures.

Along with the funding, the new national plan implements federal “objectives and targets” that are meant to “focus policy and spending on measurable results.” The government did not elaborate on all the targets, but said it has opened the strategy to the provinces and territories over the next 90 days for consultation.

“We must not only reduce the emissions that cause climate change, we must also adapt to the changes that are upon us,” Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault said in the statement.

The National Adaptation Strategy was unveiled Nov. 24 in St. Peter’s Bay, Prince Edward Island, and was attended Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair and Veterans Affairs Minister Lawrence MacAulay, while Ginette Petitpas Taylor, the minister responsible for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, attended by videoconference.

MacAulay said extreme weather events in Canada have recently been “made worse by climate change.”

“The destruction—it’s heartbreaking,” MacAulay said in reference to the aftermath of Hurricane Fiona, which struck Atlantic Canada in September.

The government says flooding is Canada’s most expensive hazard, with “average residential costs” reaching $2.9 billion annually. The government also estimates average annual losses from natural disasters to reach $15.4 billion by 2030, which it claims can be significantly reduced by spending on adaptation measures.

“Climate change is the single biggest threat to human health,” said Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos in a statement. “Adapting to and mitigating the inevitable effects of a changing climate is crucial to improving public health.”

Response

NDP and Green Party MPs voiced support for the national adaptation strategy, although Green Party MP Mike Morrice said he would like to see even more investments made by the federal government to fight climate change.

“We continue to pursue the governing party,” he told Parliament Hill reporters on Nov. 24.

Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre is yet to comment on the new adaptation strategy, but has previously said that the Liberals’ climate action initiatives are merely part of a “tax plan.”

Poilievre has been especially critical of the federal carbon tax, which is set to increase in March 2023.

“[The prime minister’s] carbon tax has not hit a single, solitary emissions reduction target. It has not worked,” he said in the House of Commons on Oct. 5.

“He has a tax plan, not a climate plan, that has raised money for his government but it’s not reduced emissions or hit targets.”

The government’s current climate plan seeks to reach net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions across the country by 2050."

Following the release of the National Adaptation Strategy, Craig Stewart, Vice-President, Climate Change and Federal Issues, Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC), issued the following statement:

""Canada's first National Adaptation Strategy is brave and ambitious. No other country has proposed such a comprehensive suite of adaptation targets. We commend Ministers Bill Blair, Steven Guilbeault and Jonathan Wilkinson and their teams on this significant accomplishment.

""The elements proposed in this strategy, especially the use of clear risk-reduction goals and outcome-based targets, are truly world-leading and are critical to both the resilience of our country and to the protection of Canadians.

""The gauntlet is now thrown. The federal government has shown the necessary leadership and rightly expects all of us to step up to help them prioritize and action these elements.

""IBC has long advocated for a National Adaptation Strategy that will result in tangible, short-term measures to improve Canada's climate defence and for government to prioritize investments that reduce the impact of these severe weather events on families and communities. With the use of outcome-based targets, Canada is rightly setting a clear focus on its climate defences in the near-term to protect Canadians. The proposed investments in infrastructure in this National Adaptation Strategy will be a welcome down payment on the actions needed to deliver on these targets.

""Over the past 15 years, insurance claims from severe weather have more than quadrupled. In today's world of extreme weather events, the new normal for yearly insured catastrophic losses in Canada has become $2 billion – most of this due to water-related damage. Between 1983 to 2008, Canadian insurers paid out an average of about $422 million a year in losses related to severe weather. The time to act is now and we're proud to see this National Adaptation Strategy present opportunity for action.""

9fa1819b-ce4f-4066-8b2b-c7330c011d6d,"ST. PETER'S BAY, P.E.I. — A national climate adaptation strategy released Thursday includes $1.6 billion in new spending to help communities faced with risks ranging from deadly heat waves and wildfires to floods and storms.

ST. PETER'S BAY, P.E.I. — A national climate adaptation strategy released Thursday includes $1.6 billion in new spending to help communities faced with risks ranging from deadly heat waves and wildfires to floods and storms.

Bill Blair, the federal minister of emergency preparedness, announced the plan in Prince Edward Island, where post-tropical storm Fiona caused widespread damage to the power system, farms and the fishing industry when it swept through the region on Sept. 24.

During a tour of Red Head Harbour just before the news conference, Blair heard from a harbour master about how the resulting storm surge demolished the wharf, and fishers described their uncertainty about when they could return to work.

""What we're seeing in the last few years … is an increase in frequency and severity of climate-related events, and it demands action from us, not just actions from one order of government but from all of us, from every Canadian,"" Blair told the news conference.

The federal funding mostly tops up existing programs and won't cover the costs of major projects, such as the proposal to raise dikes that safeguard the land link between Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.

However, the plan adds $489 million to the federal disaster adaptation fund over 10 years, helping with smaller projects that address issues such as the risk to coastlines from rising seas and collapsing infrastructure due to permafrost thaw.

There is also $284 million over five years to strengthen wildfire management through measures such as the creation of larger fire breaks between forests and communities.

In addition, Ottawa will spend $164 million over five years on flood mapping and work with provinces and territories to expand a system that identifies areas at high risk of flooding. There is also $60 million over five years to update standards for new infrastructure and $95 million over five years to provide climate tool kits for citizens and local governments.

The plan includes $30 million over five years to expand Health Canada programs helping people protect themselves from extreme heat, and $13 million over five years to expand other health programs tied to the effects of climate change.

In climate change policy, mitigation refers to actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which trap heat in the atmosphere and lead to global warming. Adaptation refers to actions adjusting to the reality of a warming planet.

Scientific assessments say that since 1948, annual average temperatures in Canada have increased by 1.7 C and 2.3 C in the North. Oceanographers have indicated that warmer waters added to the intensity of Fiona when it struck the Atlantic region, creating an estimated $660 million in insured damage.

The Insurance Bureau of Canada and the Federation of Canadian Municipalities have estimated that the three levels of government will need to spend about $5.3 billion annually to cope with climate adaptation.

However, experts say that figure could be lower if Canadians adapt to the climate we're facing now, instead of continuing to live in a country built for the climate of the past. The adaptation plan released by Blair sets targets to start this shift, though achieving these milestones would depend on co-operation from the provinces, territories and Indigenous communities.

For example, the strategy says that within three years, the goal is to have 80 per cent of health authorities across the country put in place measures to protect citizens from extreme heat, and by 2040 have systems in place to eliminate those types of deaths. Blair noted that British Columbia saw about 619 deaths during the heat wave in the summer of 2021.

The plan also calls for a clear set of codes and standards for infrastructure projects — from highways to water drainage systems — to be in place by 2030. The adaptation plan also suggests that preserving natural systems can help Canada reduce the effects of global warming, and it sets a target of conserving one-quarter of the country's lands and waters by 2025.

Louise Comeau, director of climate solutions at the Conservation Council of New Brunswick, said she's pleased the plan sets ambitious goals — including that six in 10 Canadians become ""aware of the disaster risks facing their household"" two years from now.

However, she said more details need to be provided on how these goals will be achieved, and she said provinces and territories should be required to agree to meet pre-set objectives before they receive the federal money.

""The $1.6 billion won't go very far … so they better be efficient with the money,"" she said.

44b93185-66eb-43cd-a36f-4015f836f40a,"NORTH VANCOUVER, BC, Nov. 24, 2022 /CNW/ - Canadians are feeling the devastating impacts of climate change across the country — from illnesses worsened by heat and air pollution to fires and floods in major cities and regions to damages to coastal communities due to extreme weather events. Climate change is warming southern Canada at twice the global average and approximately three times as quickly in the North.

Earlier today on Prince Edward Island, the Honourable Bill Blair, President of the King's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Emergency Preparedness, on behalf of the Honourable Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Environment and Climate Change, released Canada's first-ever National Adaptation Strategy: Building Resilient Communities and a Strong Economy. The Strategy establishes a common direction for preparing for climate change events across five key systems: disaster resilience; health and well-being; nature and biodiversity; infrastructure; and economy and workers.

Minister Blair also released the Government of Canada Adaptation Action Plan, which sets out the federal role in preparing Canadians for climate hazards and outlines specific investments, programs and initiatives that are making Canada more resilient to climate impacts. Minister Blair announced over $1.6 billion in new federal spending to support climate adaptation.

To underscore the importance of the Strategy for Canadians in Western and Northern Canada, the Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, Minister of Natural Resources, today highlighted new funding that is being provided to three federal programs that form part of the Action Plan and will be delivered by Natural Resources Canada for Canadians across the country:

Boosting the Flood Hazard Identification and Mapping Program to:

Launching a Wildfire Resilient Futures Initiative to:

Launching a Climate Resilient Coastal and Northern Communities program to:

The Strategy is now open to the provinces, territories and National Indigenous Organizations for a final 90 days of engagement on the Strategy's common goals and specific measurable targets and objectives. The Strategy is a result of extensive engagement since 2021 and presents a shared vision for climate resilience in the country and a framework to measure progress nationally.

Story continues

Making adaptation investments now will have major economy-wide benefits later. Expert research suggests that every dollar invested in prevention and preparation can save up to 15 dollars in costs. Adapting to climate change requires that all orders of government, the private sector and Canadians work together to build resilient communities and a stronger economy, ultimately ensuring Canadians continue to thrive into the future.

Quotes

""Canadians in every region of the country are already feeling the effects of climate change, and the costs of these impacts are projected to rise to $25 billion by 2025 and to the range of $100 billion annually by 2050. Inaction is not an option. Through the National Adaptation Strategy, we will advance key resilience and adaptation measures to mitigate these changes, preserve livelihoods and protect our communities and the critical infrastructure we depend on. The result will be a stronger, safer and more prosperous place to call home.""

The Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson

Minister of Natural Resources

""Canada is warming at twice the global rate and approximately three times the global average in the North. While we must keep fighting climate change, we must also be better prepared for the changes we are already seeing. Adaptation is about reducing the impacts of climate change on Canadians and communities and being better prepared to respond and recover. Canada's National Adaptation Strategy gives us a world-leading and unified path forward not only to adapt but also to thrive under changing conditions.""

The Honourable Steven Guilbeault

Minister of Environment and Climate Change

Quick Facts

Canada launched a Map of Adaptation Actions in 2019 that provides engineers, public health professionals, urban planners, mayors and anyone else involved in long-term planning with user-friendly climate change information, data, resources and tools. Visit www.climatedata.ca to learn more.

Some of the Government of Canada's most significant existing spending measures to support climate adaptation include:

By 2025, climate impacts will slow Canada's economic growth by $25 billion annually, which is equal to 50 percent of projected GDP growth.

By 2030, the average annual losses from disasters is forecast to reach $15.4 billion — a forecast that can be reduced by ambitious adaptation action.

Flooding is Canada's costliest hazard, with average residential costs of $2.9 billion per year.

Analyses of adaptation actions across Canada revealed that, on average, every dollar invested in adaptation generates significant benefits. Some examples include:

The Government of Canada is continuing to invest in making life more affordable for families across the country by helping homeowners switch from expensive home heating oil to energy-efficient cold-climate heat pumps through a $250 million investment for the Oil to Heat Pump Affordability Grant , a new stream to add to the existing Canada Greener Homes Initiative .

3e298194-6c34-4afa-b009-30e290d51f6e,"(Adds comment from climate think-tank)

By Nia Williams

Nov 24 (Reuters) - Canada published its first ever national climate adaptation strategy on Thursday, including C$1.6 billion ($1.2 billion) in new federal funding commitments to help protect communities against the increasing impacts of global warming.

Like many countries around the world, Canada is seeing a rise in extreme weather caused by climate change, with average annual losses from disasters forecast to reach C$15.4 billion by 2030, according to the government.

The goal of the adaptation strategy is to help reduce those losses with federal policy and investment. Research shows that every dollar spent on adaptation measures saves up to C$15 in costs, including both direct and indirect economy-wide benefits, the government said.

""The fight against climate change has reached our doorstep. We must not only reduce the emissions that cause climate change, we must also adapt to the changes that are upon us,"" federal Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault said in a statement.

Canada is the world's fourth-largest oil producer and the second-highest carbon emitter among the Group of 20 major economies on a per capita basis, according to research from the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR).

Implementing new flooding and wildfire standards for new construction, for example, could save Canada an estimated C$4.7 billion a year, according to the statement, while urban forests in the city of Toronto have lowered cooling costs, improved air quality, and reduced strains on stormwater infrastructure.

The strategy focuses on five priorities: improving health, building and maintaining resilient public infrastructure, protecting nature and biodiversity, supporting the economy, and reducing the impact of climate-related disasters.

The C$1.6 billion in new funding takes Ottawa's total spending earmarked for adaptation and resilience to more than C$8 billion.

Story continues

The federal government spent two years consulting on the strategy with provinces, territories, municipalities and Indigenous groups, which will now have 90 days to comment.

The Canadian Climate Institute (CCI), a think tank, said the move represents a major step forward, but it still needs more detail on how the overall goals of the strategy address Canada's biggest climate risks, and processes for coordinating action plans are unclear.

""This new strategy gives us a fighting chance to staunch the bleeding,"" said CCI president Rick Smith. ""While there is still more to do to ensure this strategy drives meaningful progress, its implementation will help Canada prepare for the threats ahead.""

e122d0dd-72a2-4db8-a2a8-cdd912f83a02,"This summer, I descended more than 6.7 miles to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean in a two-seat submarine to the world’s deepest undersea chasm, the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench.

My goal was to explore a previously unvisited area of the trench and use high-resolution sonar to map that part of our planet in never-before-seen detail. We remarkably have far more detailed maps of the moon, Mars and Venus than we do of our own oceans.

The timing is critical. The ocean has absorbed more than 90% of the extra heat we’ve created since 1955 and 25% of our carbon dioxide emissions. But this capacity has limits, and the warming ocean can only take in so much of our emissions before it becomes more acidic and leaks carbon dioxide more quickly into the atmosphere. Using geographic information system (GIS) technology allows us to map these limits and solve a much larger puzzle: mapping the entirety of the ocean in detail by 2030.

GIS technology is perhaps “the most important weapon we have to fight climate change,” in the words of the White House’s special assistant to the president for climate policy. How could maps have such significant impact?

Every day, satellites capture an image of each square foot of land on Earth. The number of images taken is so large that the flood of data is beyond human comprehension. GIS takes in these images and translates the data into observations humans can understand, allowing us to more closely track large-scale changes to our climate. It pulls in data from spreadsheets, satellites and drone photos and displays it on “smart maps” that show us relationships, patterns and risks we may not have otherwise recognized.

The sonar data we collected in the Mariana Trench will be stitched together to create an elevation model as well as a visualization that resembles an aerial photograph, showing the shape of our deep seafloor. The bottom of the ocean is vital to our climate because heat travels through the undulating waters via paths shaped by the ocean floor’s topography. GIS makes it possible to map ocean terrain so that we can better understand how heat is moving. That, in turn, tells us how the heat will affect the water above and, eventually, the atmosphere and weather. More information on heat cycling through the ocean will help us understand when it fuels hurricanes, which research indicates have been intensified by climate change.

Beyond our waters, GIS can also show us where average temperatures are rising, by how much and what to do about it. It shows, for example, that by 2050 the most viable land for corn production in the U.S. will move from in and around Iowa — where temperatures are expected to rise by 7 degrees — some 350 miles northeast to Wisconsin.

We have this technology now. It’s not a gamble that needs to be built from scratch — scientists have been using it since 1963. But we have just recently begun to translate its potential into a crucial tool: publicly-funded online climate portals. These climate portals are digital collections in a single place, such as a website, that make environmental data and models publicly available.

California is already seeing the benefits of this approach with CA Nature, the public data site from the California Natural Resources Agency. It uses GIS to share and analyze data about land that’s already conserved, as well as land that could be conserved and would most help foster desperately needed biodiversity that is threatened by climate change.

California should share maps that include even more thorough data, extending to our oceans and tailored to the context of living in, working in and sustaining the world’s sixth-largest economy. The White House’s recently launched Climate Mapping for Resilience and Adaptation Portal lets users search climate data by address, census tract and county. Detailed state-level portals could complement this federal data to help tribes, regions and communities visualize local climate threats. Such information can connect areas seeking fixes with those that have already put solutions into practice to foster collaborations.

That’s what I’ve hoped to do in my undersea research. With a rare seat alongside explorer Victor Vescovo to dive to Challenger Deep, I helped carry forward the work of many co-collaborators aiming to better understand the entirety of our seas by 2030.

The dive also gave me a close-up view of something else, sitting in sediment at the bottom of the ocean at the Earth’s deepest point: a beer bottle. It had traveled more than 6.7 miles to the darkest depths of the Pacific, label still intact. This discarded trash had managed to reach an unsullied part of our world before we actually did — a symbol of how deeply and irrevocably humans are affecting the natural world.

Using mapping technology, we must get to know all the nooks, crannies, chasms and crevices of this planet, together, to fully understand the challenges in our changing world — and clearly see solutions.

Dawn Wright is the chief scientist at the digital mapping technology company Esri, a professor of geography and oceanography at Oregon State University and a member of the National Academy of Sciences. She is one of few individuals — and the first Black person — to visit Challenger Deep. Her latest book is “GIS for Science: Maps for Saving the Planet.”"
d722a203-507e-425d-911e-f44ee2316c0b,"Today, every issue is a climate issue. It's no longer just higher temperatures, wildfires, and rising sea levels, but issues we previously thought had nothing to do with climate change—like the severity of the seasonal flu or invasive species in our farmlands. The way we prepare for annual hurricane seasons or flooding in certain parts of the world will all have to change. Problems formerly considered purely social or economic are now climate problems, and how we deal with them will resonate for generations. This is literally humanity's greatest challenge.

That's why we're hosting RE:WIRED Green, a one-day event bringing together creative individuals from a wide array of fields who are working on these challenges and have solutions in hand. From food insecurity and inequity to comprehensive energy solutions, all the way to technologies both new and old that can help reduce the impact of our already warming climate.

We're gathering scientists, entrepreneurs, innovators, and activists to discuss everything from carbon capture and de-extinction to synthetic foods and youth activism. Our goal is to highlight ways that human ingenuity can help secure our future. By the end of the day, we will have heard about actionable, useful steps on every level—personal, local, and global—where we can all make a tangible difference.

The day's activities are organized around three big themes:

In our first programming block of the day, we focus on what people can do today, right now, to minimize the negative impacts of climate change across the globe, and how today's changes can ease us into greater, more substantial change on a broad scale.

WIRED senior writer Lauren Goode will host a series of talks and conversations with people like paleontologist and explorer Kenneth Lacovara, who'll discuss the fragile history of life on Earth, and photographer Camille Seaman, who has spent years documenting our changing world through her lens and will share some of her most striking work with us."
045fc9a5-d551-4ed8-8e14-e149249fc09f,"With a pivotal gathering of international climate delegates in Egypt just six weeks away, tides of international business people, government officials, and non-profit staff convened in New York City event spaces and auditoriums last week for perhaps the year’s second-most ballyhooed climate event: Climate Week NYC. The program centered on businesses, and a survey of name tags at the week’s opening ceremony revealed a who’s who of international banks and corporations.

The event started out on a somber tone, with the chief of the World Meteorological Organization, Petteri Taalas, warning that the world faced a 50-50 chance of exceeding 1.5 degrees of warming in the next five years. His report was followed by something more positive: a presentation from McKinsey & Company consultant Laura Corb, who described—with a healthy dose of business jargon and corporate leadership metaphors—the “opportunities” the energy transition would bring for businesses.

It was a strange choice for such a prominent role, though perhaps unsurprising, considering McKinsey sponsored the event. In recent years, the management consultancy has endured a drumbeat of criticism for its role in exacerbating America’s opioid crisis and advancing the interests of autocratic governments like China and Saudi Arabia. The company has also consulted for some of the world’s worst polluters, helping to maximize profits for companies like ExxonMobil, Russia’s Gazprom, and Saudi Aramco. As recently as 2019, it worked to help “improve productivity” at Teck Resources, one of the world’s largest coal companies, according to the New York Times. But these topics weren’t broached during an on-stage interview with Corb conducted by Helen Clarkson, CEO of Climate Group, which organized Climate Week NYC. When I approached Corb after the event, she politely suggested I talk to McKinsey’s public relations representatives. (Over email, they referred me to an op-ed defending McKinsey’s work with polluters.)

Organizers had made clear that Climate Week NYC was supposed to be a positive event. “Threats of doom and destruction do not motivate people,” Clarkson told attendees during her opening address. “What does motivate people is hearing about work that’s being done to tackle the crisis at all levels.” And while event attendees from the scientific or advocacy community were unlikely to be sanguine about the current state of climate progress, representatives from the world’s most powerful corporations were more than happy to comply. Amazon announced it would begin using low-emission electrofuels to power its long haul trucks. PepsiCo and food processing giant ADM promoted their collaboration on regenerative agriculture. National Grid, one of the event’s “headline partners” unveiled a plan for a clean energy and hydrogen hub on Long Island.

More from TIME

There has been progress on climate action in recent years. But the fact is that the world has not moved nearly fast enough to keep the atmosphere from warming to catastrophic levels. Global emissions are still going in the wrong direction, rising 6% in 2021. Many big companies have made commitments to zero out their emissions by 2050, but few have presented adequate details of how they’re planning to get there. “That’s actually worse, in a way,” says Catherine McKenna, chair of the UN High-Level Expert Group on Net-Zero Commitments of Non-State Entities. “It makes us all feel good, but we’re not actually doing the work.”

Some of the very companies represented at Climate Week are part of the problem, but they took the opportunity to frame less-than-stellar climate progress as game changing environmental breakthroughs, or, worse, to greenwash active efforts to slow the energy transition. National Grid’s proposed hydrogen project, for instance, contains a controversial provision to use piped hydrogen to heat homes, a move regarded by many in the environmental community as a preposterous waste of resources compared to simply rolling out electric heat pumps. (Over email, a representative from National Grid said that the company is not against electrification, but favors “a hybrid approach.”) National Grid is also on the steering committee of New Yorkers for Affordable Energy, which advocates against state efforts to cut natural gas use through Facebook posts, local op-eds, and, recently, a six-figure ad campaign to drum up opposition against clean energy legislation in the state. Clarkson says Climate Group does “a lot of due diligence” on sponsors like McKinsey and National Grid.

“We are members of many coalitions,” the National Grid representative wrote over email. “While we may not agree with every point of view, it is important for us to be part of the conversation.”

The theme of this year’s Climate Week—“Getting it done”—seemed to try and tackle concerns around inaction by focusing in large part on how companies could turn their climate goals into actual emissions reductions in the near term. But some observers said the tone of the event felt out of touch with the urgency of the crisis. Abbie Dillen, president of environmental nonprofit Earthjustice, says she noticed that many executives at Climate Week tended to speak mostly in generalities, avoiding the hard specifics of exactly how and when they will implement emissions cuts. “We don’t want to be in the triage room talking philosophy,” she says. “We want to be ordering the scalpels and scissors.”

Part of that lack of urgency may have to do with who wasn’t present at Climate Week: people on the frontlines of climate change—like workers contending with extreme heat, or families fleeing immense floods—whose lives might well be directly impacted by decisions made by the executives present, but who often felt a million miles away from the event’s heady corporate presentations. Among Climate Week organizers, the logic is that closed-door sessions between business leaders can encourage them to take positive action and share important ideas about sustainability. Clarkson, the Climate Group CEO, told TIME that she isn’t concerned about the dearth of representation from outside the business community and high levels of government. “It’s not that we’re trying to exclude those people,” she said. “It’s being pragmatic about what makes change happen.” She noted that executives and other decision makers already understand the stakes of the climate crisis because they read the news.

The issue, though, is that there are few forums where people outside circles of money and power can get a say over what powerful companies are doing in the name of sustainability. In the Midwest United States, for example, a vast network of carbon capture projects is being planned despite outcry from landowners opposed to having the carbon dioxide pipelines crossing their land. At Climate Week, a panel on carbon capture brought in experts from Credit Suisse, Citi Bank, the U.S. Department of Energy, and the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers. Not present, though, was anyone from the communities that might actually be affected by their plans.

And sometimes at Climate Week, there simply wasn’t a chance to challenge companies’ version of things. In a panel discussion on climate communications, an executive from Meta (formerly Facebook) talked up the platform’s fact checking partnerships, describing how the company was “inoculating” people against misinformation on its platform. Standing in the back of the room, I waited for a chance to ask about the millions of dollars the company had received in recent years to show ads promoting fossil fuels. Then, without taking questions from the audience, the organizers ended the panel discussion and moved on. The company did not respond to requests for comment over email.

According to conclusions of the study, in this climate change scenario, the instability of marine-based ice sheets —those that flow directly into the ocean— was instrumental in accelerating global warming. The article is based on a research project co-led by Isabel Cacho, professor at the Department of Earth and Ocean Dynamics of the Faculty of Earth Sciences of the University of Barcelona and member of the UB Consolidated Research Group in Marine Geosciences, together with Heather M. Stoll, professor at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (Switzerland).

Knowing precisely the speed of the melting process of large polar ice masses is one of the great scientific challenges regarding climate change. The study of past ice meltings — although they are not analogous to the current situation— provides an experimental scenario for analysing the speed of response of these ice masses.

To study the melting processes on the planet, until now only solid chronologies were available for the last deglaciation, a climatic period that lasted about 9,000 years. The study, partially carried out at the Scientific and Technological Centres of the UB (CCiTUB), now presents the first record of the melting of the penultimate deglaciation with a robust and contrasted chronology, and it reveals that this melting was concentrated over a period of about 5,000 years —from 135,000 to 130,000 years before the present—, introducing significant changes in the chronologies that had been accepted until now.

Stalagmites on the Cantabrian mountains to study climate change

The penultimate deglaciation is a period that is difficult to date using marine records, always based on indirect techniques that are very imprecise for analysing changes in the climate system on a time scale of decades, centuries or even millennia. This study is based on the analysis of stalagmites from the caves of the Cantabrian mountains in the Iberian Peninsula, climate archives that reveal changes in the salinity of the North Atlantic derived from the melting of large polar ice sheets and, in addition, they provide information on the evolution of atmospheric temperatures in the region in the past.

""To date, this penultimate deglaciation was only well dated in cave records from tropical areas (Asia and South America) but in no case were they able to capture the melting signal over the North Atlantic"", says Isabel Cacho, ICREA Academia researcher at the UB.

The use of stalagmites as climate sensors makes it possible to establish chronologies with high scientific accuracy. But, in addition, the chemistry of the carbonate that forms the stalagmites picks up climatic variables that are decisive in reconstructing the climate. In the case of the caves in this study, rainfalls in the North Atlantic transfer the melting signal to the carbonate, while the biological activity of the land fixes the air temperature signal to the chemistry of the water percolating into the cave.

Ocean, atmosphere and cryosphere

The integration of these three elements —solid chronologies, ice melt and temperature indicators— gives the published records a unique character of extraordinary value for understanding the processes of atmosphere-ocean interaction during phases of global planetary warming. These results have allowed us to reformulate previously accepted hypotheses and to outline a novel chronological framework that has been transferred to existing marine records, providing a new perspective on the speed of the processes at work during the penultimate deglaciation.

“Our study establishes an anchor point in the chronology from the beginning to the end of the melting, confirming the long-accepted hypothesis that changes in insolation controlled by the Earth’s orbital movements are the triggers of this major climate change”, says Isabel Cacho. “But it allows us to establish —she continues— for the first time a robust chronology of the oceanic and atmospheric feedback processes triggered by this initial insolation change, a change that was very modest regarding the Earth’s energy balance”.

“Therefore, the intensity of the last deglaciation’s warming was not controlled by the insolation changes but by climate feedback processes between the ocean, the atmosphere and the cryosphere or the ice mass”, she adds.

The fragility of marine-based ice sheets

Sea-based ice sheets were instrumental in accelerating the warming process of the penultimate deglaciation. ""Marine currents contribute to the melting of the base of these glaciers, and as these structures become more fluid and fragile, the rate of glacier progression accelerates, and the ice is discharged directly into the sea at a rate that does not allow the glacier to regenerate,"" explains Professor Judit Torner, a member of the UB Consolidated Research Group in Marine Geosciences and co-author of the study.

However, the direct discharge of ice into the ocean has a direct impact on ocean currents and it caused an abrupt slowdown of marine circulation in the North Atlantic. ""This has happened repeatedly in the past, but our study indicates that this process was particularly intense, rapid and prolonged during the penultimate deglaciation"", Torner adds.

This change in circulation was decisive in climate evolution as it directly affected the oceanic carbon cycle, with an increase in atmospheric CO2 levels and, therefore, in the greenhouse effect of the atmosphere. “This caused an enormous amplification of the warming process during this penultimate deglaciation”, the researchers point out.

Glaciers of the past, lessons of the present

Today, much of the glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica have a marine base that shows signs of melting and destabilisation. Another cause for concern is that the oceanic and atmospheric processes that reacted to the melting described in the article are not different from those described in other deglaciations, ""but the penultimate deglaciation —says Isabel Cacho—is unique in the sense that it gave way to an interglacial period that was warmer than the current one (about 0.5-1.5ºC warmer than pre-industrial temperatures)”. These conditions lasted for centuries and caused a superior melting of ice in Greenland and Antarctica, raising sea levels by 5-6 metres above present levels. ""This suggests that not only the feedback processes themselves, but the speed with which they react, are capable of shaping the intensity of climate change"", adds Isabel Cacho.

""This is very worrying, as we are currently experiencing the most rapid climate change in the history of our planet. Our observations of past climates confirm available climate projections, urging us to put measures in place to contain global warming to below 1.5°C and thus slow down a series of changes that will come at a high cost to us and the ecosystems that sustain us. But containing climate change requires immediate action at all levels"", the researchers conclude."

ce1a57e5-0c80-4c11-aafd-207e9d7eff7b,"Climate policy can sometimes seem like it is being spoken in a different language. Take the issue of the moment in Australia: the safeguard mechanism.

For people deeply embedded in the mechanics of how governments plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the safeguard mechanism has become a reasonably familiar subject since it was introduced by the Coalition six years ago – even though the Morrison government and its predecessors didn’t like to talk about it much.

Its relevance increased significantly in May, when the Albanese government was elected promising to make it a centrepiece of its pledge to ramp up climate action. But I suspect for most people, even those paying regular attention, the details are hazy.

From the time it was created under then prime minister Tony Abbott, the story of the safeguard has been one of obfuscation and marketing.

Its awkward name is a relic from the era when Abbott and his environment minister, Greg Hunt, were pledging “direct action” on climate change. Their promise was that farmers and businesses would be paid by the government to store carbon dioxide, mostly in vegetation and soil. The cash would be drawn from an emissions reduction fund, then worth $2.5bn.

The safeguard mechanism was meant to stop pollution at industrial sites from increasing and cancelling out any cuts paid for through the fund. It set a baseline – a limit – on the biggest 215 polluting facilities based on their historic emissions. The idea was the limits would safeguard the reductions bought by the government.

Polluters that emitted more than their baseline would have to pay, either by buying carbon offsets or facing a fine. Hunt’s plan was that this would eventually evolve into an emissions trading scheme. Polluters that emitted below their limits would earn carbon credits and could sell them to companies that pumped out more than their limit, creating an incentive to act.

In 2015, Hunt declared the safeguard would be used to cut emissions by 200m tonnes between 2020 and 2030. But his Coalition colleagues didn’t agree, and the evolution never happened. Instead, companies were often allowed to increase emissions without penalty. RepuTex, the firm that modelled Labor’s climate policies, found industrial emissions under the safeguard jumped 7% under the Coalition. Which, not unreasonably, led industry leaders and climate activists to wonder what the point was.

Labor decided there could be a point, and last year promised to transform the safeguard mechanism into something that actually cut pollution. The ALP didn’t necessarily believe the safeguard mechanism was the best possible policy. It made a political decision about how it could minimise the chance of a dishonest scare campaign over climate before the election, and give it something to work with if it won. So it adopted a suggestion by the Business Council of Australia that it should take the failing Coalition policy – an emissions trading scheme in all but name – and make it functional.

Achieving that will likely mean withstanding the sort of rent-seeking claims by industry that hindered Labor’s development of carbon pricing systems more than a decade ago.

The good news is the world has moved significantly since then. A majority of industrial polluters now have commitments to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Are they going to argue they need handouts or carve outs to protect them change they have already promised? Almost certainly, but it will be a harder case to make.

The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, has set a short deadline to revamp the scheme, promising a new model will be in place by July. Submissions to the government from experts and interest groups are rolling in, and setting out a long list of difficult issues to unpick. But a few stand out.

The government says it expects emissions covered by the safeguard mechanism to be reduced by between 3.5% and 6% a year by gradually reducing baselines. A major question will be who carries this load, and who doesn’t.

The Investor Group on Climate Change, which represents funds that manage more than $3tn, is one of several groups arguing that the cost will be higher on everyone else if unsustainable industries that will inevitably shrink in a net zero economy – coal and gas mining and production – are protected from short-term action on the grounds they compete in overseas markets.

They say assistance should be mostly limited to industries that have a future - renewable energy, critical minerals and green steel, hydrogen and aluminium – and designed to drive transformational change that starts now, rather than delays it.

The second issue sounds redundant but history has shown is worth asking. Will Labor’s changes guarantee that industrial emissions start to come down?

The government appears to favour a design that sets a limit for polluting facilities based not on their absolute emissions, but their emissions intensity – that is, how much they emit per unit of production. At first blush, this sounds a bizarre step, given it could lead to companies that expand operations increasing their emissions even if they become more efficient. But there are arguments for it.

Many companies have had baselines set well above what they actually emit. Resetting baselines based on emissions intensity could be a relatively simple way to remove this “headroom” and ensure limits are real before a path is set to reduce them to zero. An emissions intensity baselines also mean companies are not rewarded if pollution falls due to a slump in production. Instead, they would have to make genuine changes in how they operate to stay within their limits.

The downside is that it could still lead to emissions increases in the short-term. The Australian Conservation Foundation argues a way around this would be to set two baselines for each facility – one based on emissions intensity and the other absolute emissions – and require companies to meet whichever was lower or pay for their excess pollution.

A third substantial issue is what to do about new coal and gas developments. There are several fossil fuel proposals in the pipeline, and Labor has rejected calls for a moratorium. An alternative put forward by some groups would be to set sector-wide emissions limits that are reduced over time so that any new project would have to fit into a declining industry total, not add to it. Otherwise, hopes of meeting emissions targets could quickly evaporate.

Managing these and other thorny questions about the safeguard’s design – including the extent to which companies should be allowed to rely on carbon credits, rather than cut pollution onsite – will be politically challenging.

The ultimate test, though, will be whether the final model is robust enough to help Australia play its part in meeting the goal that Bowen stressed in a speech in the US on Friday - limiting the rise in global heating since pre-industrial times to as close to 1.5C as possible.

That will require it to be able to be ratcheted up to deliver faster cuts in emissions than currently proposed. We will get a sense pretty soon whether it is up to the task."

Big investors want the Australian government to make it less risky to invest in a cleaner economy, backed by deeper cuts in national emissions.

Unless climate change is addressed in an orderly and fair way, the long-term retirement savings of millions of Australians are under threat, according to the Investor Group on Climate Change.

The group, whose members manage more than $3 trillion in Australian funds, issued a report on Wednesday detailing the federal action they say will protect returns and unlock essential private capital.

Climate change will be a crucial factor in long-term financial returns, and the biggest benefit will come from limiting economic damage from global warming, according to the group’s CEO Rebecca Mikula-Wright.

Emissions milestones for 2030, 2035 and 2040 are needed to avoid putting at risk the communities and financial and environmental systems that investors operate within, the report said.

A national target aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees would require emissions to be reduced by approximately three-quarters (75 per cent) by 2035.

Newly set federal policy under the Albanese government will see emissions cut by 43 per cent this decade, with no commitment to deeper cuts by 2035.

Ms Mikula-Wright said institutional investors have the capital to finance a less harmful economy run on clean energy.

“Governments can’t finance this transformation itself, but they can set policies that will unlock billions in private investment,” Ms Mikula-Wright said.

The report found unstable policy around investment in new technologies, goods, and services was the biggest barrier.

Climate change has become a mainstream consideration in global capital markets during Australia’s “climate wars” as successive governments changed policies and created uncertainty for investors.

Australia should commit to phasing out all fossil fuel subsidies by 2025, in consultation with investors, business and people who will need new jobs, the report said.

A mandatory climate risk disclosure regime that is consistent with international best practice and fit for purpose for Australia’s emissions-intensive economy is also on the wishlist.

The regime should be aligned with the global Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and signal that international sustainability standards for accounting will be adopted in Australia.

The investors also call for an incentive across the electricity market to help replace coal-fired plants, and more effort to grow demand for alternative fuels such as green hydrogen.

Australia can’t avoid significant change across most industries and regions, and costs and opportunities must be spread fairly, the report warns.

Without community support, the transition to net-zero emissions could be slower and more costly.

But, did anyone ever think that global climate change might wreak havoc on observatories? It turns out the answer is “yes.”

We’re all familiar with the predictions about global climate change. It will make hot places hotter, cold places colder, and bring wilder weather to places around the planet. Economically, its effects already make a dent in global trading and are changing living conditions for millions of people. And, inevitably, it will change astronomy and the places where astronomers do their work.

Observatories Need Dry, Clear Air

Observations from ground-based telescopes are incredibly sensitive to local atmospheric conditions. Most observatories are located well above sea level. Less atmosphere to peek through means better astronomical data. And, there are other factors, too. For example, observatories on the Big Island of Hawai’i sit atop a 4,000-meter volcano. Infrared-sensitive instruments, like those at the Subaru and Gemini observatories, function very effectively there. That’s because there is so little water vapor in the high-altitude air and near-infrared light can slip right through. Many telescopes are also built in deserts, which also have less cloudy nights and lower water vapor content. Those observing sites are much more sensitive to climate change. Wilder conditions will adversely affect observatories long before their instrument lifetimes are up.

Back when these places were planned and built, selection committees only looked at shorter-term atmospheric analyses (like five years or so of weather data). They also used older climate models to project future conditions at the sites. As astronomy faces the challenges of global climate change, it looks like it’ll have to improve its site selection criteria and look at longer-term climate predictions.

That’s the conclusion a team of researchers came to, led by Caroline Haslebacher at the University of Bern and the National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) PlanetS. They analyzed environmental conditions at a number of the world’s sites. The group also looked at the site selection process for each facility. Team members recommend that planners use longer timeframes and newer climate models to predict atmospheric conditions at new sites.

Climate Change and Ground-based Observatories

So, how will things change for astronomy in the age of anthropogenic climate change? For one thing, global warming has the effect of putting more water into the atmosphere. To be specific, major astronomical observatories from Hawai’i to the Canary Islands, Chile, Mexico, South Africa, and Australia will experience an increase in temperature and atmospheric water content by 2050. Those changes will affect observing time and the quality of data they obtain.

“Nowadays, astronomical observatories are designed to work under the current site conditions and only have a few possibilities for adaptation,” said Haslebacher, the lead author of the study. “Potential consequences of the climatic conditions for telescopes, therefore, include a higher risk of condensation due to an increased dew point or malfunctioning cooling systems, which can lead to more air turbulence in the telescope dome.”

It’s likely that the technology and observing practices in current facilities can adjust to these conditions in the short term. However, for future observatories, planners should use better atmospheric models in site selection criteria. Haslebacher points out that improved data is the key to avoiding the degradation of ground-based astronomy. “Even though telescopes usually have a lifetime of several decades, site selection processes only consider the atmospheric conditions over a short timeframe. Usually over the past five years – too short to capture long-term trends, let alone future changes caused by global warming,” she said.

What’s Next for Observatories in an Age of Climate Change?

The fact that past planners didn’t take the effects of climate change into account was not simply an oversight. They had to plan with the information they had. Study co-author Marie-Estelle Demory (of the Wyss Academy at the University of Bern, Switzerland) points out that state-of-the-art climate models are incredibly important for future observatory sites. “Thanks to the higher resolution of the global climate models developed through the Horizon 2020 PRIMAVERA project, we were able to examine the conditions at various locations of the globe with great fidelity,” she said. “This is something that we were unable to do with conventional models. These models are valuable tools for the work we do at the Wyss Academy.”

Global climate change isn’t going away. It’s something that we’ll all have to deal with in the coming decades. For astronomers, it’s yet another challenge to face. The silver lining is that the data are there to help, according to Haslebacher. “This now allows us to say with certainty that anthropogenic climate change must be taken into account in the site selection for next-generation telescopes, and in the construction and maintenance of astronomical facilities,” she said.

The quality of ground-based astronomical observations delicately depends on the clarity of the atmosphere above the location from which they are made. Sites for telescopes are therefore very carefully selected. They are often high above sea level, so that less atmosphere stands between them and their targets. Many telescopes are also built in deserts, as clouds and even water vapor hinder a clear view of the night sky.

A team of researchers led by the University of Bern and the National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) PlanetS shows in a study, published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics and presented at the Europlanet Science Congress 2022 in Granada, how one of the major challenges of our time—anthropogenic climate change—now even affects our view of the cosmos.

A blind spot in the selection process

""Even though telescopes usually have a lifetime of several decades, site selection processes only consider the atmospheric conditions over a short timeframe. Usually over the past five years—too short to capture long-term trends, let alone future changes caused by global warming,"" Caroline Haslebacher, lead author of the study and researcher at the NCCR PlanetS at the University of Bern, points out.

The team of researchers from the University of Bern and the NCCR PlanetS, ETH Zurich, the European Southern Observatory (ESO) as well as the University of Reading in the UK therefore took it upon themselves to show the long-term perspective.

Worsening conditions around the globe

Their analysis of future climate trends, based on high resolution global climate models, shows that major astronomical observatories from Hawaii to the Canary Islands, Chile, Mexico, South Africa and Australia will likely experience an increase in temperature and atmospheric water content by 2050. This, in turn, could mean a loss in observing time as well as a loss of quality in the observations.

""Nowadays, astronomical observatories are designed to work under the current site conditions and only have a few possibilities for adaptation. Potential consequences of the climatic conditions for telescopes therefore include a higher risk of condensation due to an increased dew point or malfunctioning cooling systems, which can lead to more air turbulence in the telescope dome,"" Haslebacher says.

The fact that the effects of climate change on observatories had not been taken into account before was not an oversight, as study co-author Marie-Estelle Demory says, but more due to modeling limitations.

55079d59-2161-4808-867b-b58b485da689,"New research out of UC San Diego and the University of Texas shows certain types of air pollution can have significant climate-related impacts depending on where that pollution is emitted.

The study, published in the journal Science Advances, is the first to examine the link between aerosol pollution and climate effects.

Aerosols are tiny particles of material like soot from wildfires, or droplets of water from smokestacks or tailpipes. Aerosol emissions can also affect economic and agricultural productivity depending on where they are released.

Researchers have long known that the particle pollution impacts health. But, the new findings show aerosols also increase the climate effects of greenhouse gas emissions.

“It is not surprising to see that they have a big impact on societal damages compared to carbon dioxide,” said co-author Geeta Persad, a researcher at the University of Texas in Austin. “What was surprising to me was to see how different those societal damages are, depending on who emits the aerosol.”

And where those emissions happen. The impact is also tied to geography.

“The total number of infant deaths that we get from a given amount of aerosol emissions, say coming from India, is about 100 times more than emitting the same amount of aerosol from the U.S.,” Persad said.

The pollution is often released at the same time as carbon dioxide, which carries a cumulative impact on the climate. The more carbon released into the atmosphere, the warmer the planet’s climate becomes.

Aerosols act differently. Their effect tends to happen close to where they were emitted making it harder to measure widespread climate impacts.

“Aerosols that are co-emitted, with carbon dioxide and greenhouse gasses have all sorts of additional negative effects globally and so we should probably be keeping track of that as well,” said co-author Jennifer Burney, a researcher at UC San Diego.

But scientists did measure regional impacts in eight key regions: Brazil, China, East Africa, Western Europe, India, Indonesia, South Africa, and the United States.

They found that aerosol pollution could boost the regional climate impact of greenhouse gas emissions by more than 60%.

Some aerosols have reflective properties prompting researchers to ask if there were any climate benefits. The study found the emissions were always bad for the region where the pollution was created and the overall health of the planet.

Burney suggested shifting the public policy focus from just managing the pollution to managing the pollution and climate.

“The big fight in the U.S. is can the EPA think of air pollution, climate change and greenhouse gasses holistically,” Burney said. ""Are we going to let the EPA do that, this has been the policy fight.”"

The landmark decision was delivered by the committee late last week and agreed with a complaint first filed by the group in 2019. The complaint was the first legal action brought by climate-vulnerable inhabitants of low-lying islands against a nation-state.

The Torres Strait Islanders ‘Group of Eight’ claimed Australia failed to take measures such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and upgrading seawalls on the islands. The UN upheld the complaint and said the claimants should be compensated.

This decision is a breakthrough in Indigenous rights and climate justice, including by opening up new pathways for Indigenous communities – who are often on the frontline of the climate crisis – to defend their rights.

The Albanese government, which has stated its commitment to work with the Torres Strait on climate change, must now meet this moment of possibility and challenge.

Why is this so significant?

Eight Torres Strait Islanders and six of their children lodged the complaint with the UN in 2019, saying climate change was damaging their way of life, culture and livelihoods.

It was the first time people from a low-lying island exposed to rising sea levels had taken action against a government.

The Torres Strait Islanders hailed from four islands - Boigu, Poruma, Warraber and Masig. In their complaint, they described how heavy rain and storms associated with climate change had devastated their homes and food crops. Rising seas had also flooded family grave sites.

The evidence was backed by findings from the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, which called for urgent action to protect the vulnerable region.

Significantly, deep Indigenous cultural and ecological knowledge, rather than Western climate science, proved key to this UN decision. This marks a departure from broad international climate politics where Indigenous laws, cultures, knowledges and practices are often sidelined or underrepresented.

Major legal breakthrough for Indigenous rights

The UN human rights committee found Australia had failed to protect Torres Strait Islanders against the impacts of climate change and violated their right to enjoy their culture, and to be free from arbitrary interference to privacy, family and home.

These rights respectively form Article 27 and 17 of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The complaint also argued on grounds of Article 6, the right to life, but this was not upheld.

In its decision, the UN considered Torres Strait Islanders’ close connection to traditional lands and the central place of healthy ecosystems for the maintenance of cultural practices. Connection to healthy country across land and seas as well as to culture, and the ability to maintain these, were determined to be human rights.

The committee said despite some action from Australia, such as new seawalls for the four islands by next year, additional measures were required to prevent potential loss of life.

Responding to the outcome, Yessie Mosby, one of the Group of Eight and a Traditional Owner of Masig said:

I know that our ancestors are rejoicing knowing that Torres Strait Islander voices are being heard throughout the world through this landmark case […] This win gives us hope that we can protect our island homes, culture and traditions for our kids and future generations to come.

ClientEarth lawyer Sophie Marjanac, who acted for the claimants, said the outcome set a number of precedents. Specifically, it’s the first time an international tribunal has found:

a country has violated human rights law through inadequate climate policy

a nation state is responsible for their greenhouse gas emissions under international human rights law

peoples’ right to culture is at risk from climate impacts.

The decision comes just months before this year’s COP27 climate talks in Egypt, and will add weight to growing international demands for loss and damages to be meaningfully included in international climate negotiations.

Among these are calls to include recognition of and compensation for kinds of loss and damage other than economic, such as health and wellbeing, ways of being, cultural sites and sacred places.

The rise of Indigenous rights climate litigation

The Torres Strait Islands claim is part of a rapidly growing climate litigation space. Globally, climate change-related cases doubled between 2015 and 2022.

National governments are a key target of legal action. This latest decision is likely to spark more such cases in Australia and elsewhere. As UN Committee member Hélène Tigroudja said when explaining the decision:

States that fail to protect individuals under their jurisdiction from the adverse effects of climate change may be violating their human rights under international law.

The Group of Eight’s win joins similar Australian cases involving Indigenous rights. In the Tiwi Islands, for example, Indigenous people succeeded in stopping a proposal by energy giant Santos to drill for gas offshore from their islands.

Meanwhile, Youth Verdict’s success in the Queensland Land Court ensured First Nations evidence of the impacts of climate change would be heard on Country in their case against Clive Palmer’s Waratah Coal mine.

How will the new Australian government respond?

The UN committee said the Australian government should compensate Torres Strait Islanders for the harms already suffered. They called for meaningful consultation with Torres Strait communities and measures to secure their safety, such as building seawalls.

So will the UN’s decision advance an Indigenous rights agenda in Australia as the climate crisis grows?

Attorney General Mark Dreyfus said the government will consider the decision and respond in due course.

The development puts the onus on the Albanese government to ensure Indigenous rights are upheld as part of climate policy and planning.

It also sends a clear signal that governments must act on climate change. This means not just reducing emissions, but helping more vulnerable regions to adapt to the damage already done.

The United Nations has determined Australia is violating its human rights obligations to Torres Strait Islanders by failing to act on climate change in a “ground-breaking decision” on Friday.

A complaint by eight adults and six children from Boigu, Poruma, Warraber, and Masig was first filed in 2019 to the UN Human Rights Committee (UNHRC) over how Australia’s emission reduction targets weren’t sufficient enough to protect the islands from climate change damage, along with a lack of coastal defence and resilience measures like seawalls being installed.

More than three years on, it was then determined that the Federal Government was infringing on the Indigenous group’s ability to “enjoy their culture, and be free from arbitrary interferences with their private life, family, and home”.

“This morning when I woke up on Masig, I saw that the sky was full of frigate birds,” said one of the claimants, Yessie Mosby in a statement on Saturday. “In my culture, we take this as a sign from my ancestors that we would be hearing good news very soon about this case.”

“I know that our ancestors are rejoicing knowing that Torres Strait Islander voices are being heard throughout the world through this landmark case.”

Changes to weather patterns and severe flooding in recent years had destroyed family graves, and left human remains scattered across the islands, while important cultural ceremonies that need to be performed in the community’s native lands are also currently at risk.

Additionally, land degradation is affecting the amount of food available from fishing to farming, affecting traditional diet.

The outcome obliges Australia to do whatever it can in its power to ensure the safe existence of the Torres Strait Islands, and sets precedent for Indigenous Peoples internationally, according to the Our Islands Our Home campaign.

“As remedies, the Committee asked Australia to compensate the indigenous Islanders for the harm suffered, engage in meaningful consultations with their communities to assess their needs, and take measures to continue to secure the communities’ safe existence for their respective islands,” said the UNHRC."

""Accordingly, the State party is obligated, inter alia, to provide adequate compensation, to the authors for the harm that they have suffered,"" the decision on Friday said.

Eight of the Indigenous inhabitants of the Torres-Strait Islands had turned to the committee, arguing that their lives and culture are being threatened by rising sea levels and more common floods.

The UN Committee took into account that a government program for the construction of dams has been in place on the islands since 2019. However, the measures came too late, the committee said.

Fruit trees, gardens, and cemeteries are already being destroyed by rising waters, threatening the inhabitants' way of life. Minority rights, the right to a home, to family, and to privacy have been violated, the committee said.

e37b3b7f-91e4-4b49-8b20-9b922bb25276,"When we consider termites, we may think of the danger they can pose to our houses once they settle in and start eating wood.

But in fact, only about 4 percent of termite species worldwide are considered pests that might, at some point, eat your house.

In nature, wood-eating termites play a broad and important role in warm tropical and sub-tropical ecosystems.

In feeding on wood, they recycle essential nutrients to the soil and release carbon back to the atmosphere.

Our new research, published today in Science, quantified for the first time just how much termites love the warmth.

The results are striking: We found termites eat deadwood much faster in warmer conditions. For example, termites in a region with temperatures of 30°C will eat wood seven times faster than in a place with temperatures of 20°C.

Our results also point to an expanding role for termites in the coming decades, as climate change increases their potential habitat across the planet.

And this, in turn, could see more carbon stored in deadwood released into the atmosphere.

Deadwood in the global carbon cycle

Trees play a pivotal role in the global carbon cycle. They absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis, and roughly half of this carbon is incorporated into new plant mass.

While most trees grow slowly in height and diameter each year, a small proportion die. Their remains then enter the deadwood pool.

Here carbon accumulates, until the deadwood is either burned or decayed through consumption by microbes (fungi and bacteria), or insects such as termites.

If the deadwood pool is consumed quickly, then the carbon stored there will rapidly be released back to the atmosphere. But if decay is slow, then the size of deadwood pool can increase, slowing the accumulation of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere.

For this reason, understanding the dynamics of the community of organisms that decay deadwood is vital, as it can help scientists predict the impacts of climate change on the carbon stored in land ecosystems.

This is important as releasing deadwood carbon to the atmosphere could speed up the pace of climate change. Storing it for longer could slow climate change down.

Testing how fast termites eat deadwood

Scientists generally understand the conditions that favor microbes' consumption of deadwood. We know their activity typically doubles with each 10°C increase in temperature. Microbial decay of deadwood is also typically faster in moist conditions.

On the other hand, scientists knew relatively little about the global distribution of deadwood-eating termites, or how this distribution would respond to different temperatures and moisture levels in different parts of the world.

To better understand this, we first developed a protocol for assessing termite consumption rates of deadwood, and tested it in a savannah and a rainforest ecosystem in northeast Queensland.

Our method involved placing a series of mesh-covered wood blocks on the soil surface in a few locations.

Half the blocks had small holes in the mesh, giving termites access. The other half didn't have such holes, so only microbes could access the blocks through the mesh.

We collected wood blocks every six months and found the blocks covered by mesh with holes decayed faster than those without, meaning the contribution of termites to this decay was, in fact, significant.

But while the test run told us about termites in Queensland, it didn't tell us what they might do elsewhere.

Our next step was to reach out to colleagues who could deploy the wood block protocol at their study sites around the world, and they enthusiastically took up the invitation.

In the end, more than 100 collaborators joined the effort at more than 130 sites in a variety of habitats, spread across six continents.

This broad coverage let us assess how wood consumption rates by termites varied with climatic factors, such as mean annual temperature and rainfall.

Termites love the warmth, and not too much rain

For the wood blocks accessible to only microbes, we confirmed what scientists already knew – that decay rates approximately doubled across sites for each 10°C increase in mean annual temperature.

Decay rates further increased when sites had higher annual rainfall, such as in Queensland's rainforests.

For the termites' wood blocks, we observed a much steeper relationship between decay rates and temperature – deadwood generally decayed almost seven times faster at sites that were 10°C hotter than others.

To put this in context, termite activity meant wood blocks near tropical Darwin at the northern edge of Australia decayed more than ten times faster than those in temperate Tasmania.

Our analyses also showed termite consumption of the wood blocks was highest in warm areas with low to intermediate mean annual rainfall.

For example, termite decay was five times faster in a sub-tropical desert in South Africa than in a tropical rainforest in Puerto Rico.

This might be because termites safe in their mounds are able to access water deep in the soil in dry times, while waterlogging can limit their ability to forage for deadwood.

Termites and climate change

Our results were synthesized in a model to predict how termite consumption of deadwood might change globally in response to climate change.

Over the coming decades, we predict greater termite activity as climate change projections show suitable termite habitat will expand north and south of the equator.

This will mean carbon cycling through the deadwood pool will get faster, returning carbon dioxide fixed by trees to the atmosphere, which could limit the storage of carbon in these ecosystems.

Reducing the amount of carbon stored on land could then start a feedback loop to accelerate the pace of climate change.

We have long known human-caused climate change would favor a few winners but leave many losers.

It would appear the humble termite is likely to be one such winner, about to experience a significant global expansion in its prime habitat.

Warming temperatures cause heatwaves and drought, while severe storms ravage our coasts. Our ever-warming planet, however, is experiencing an unexpected benefit to the enemies of wooden houses everywhere: termites.

Termites — which are actually a specialized type of cockroach — live on every continent besides Antarctica and are a vital part of the natural world. Described as “soil engineers” by researcher Pascal Jouquet in the European Journal of Soil Biology , termite activity affects all members of their ecosystem, from the smallest microbes to the largest elephants. Their domain, called the “termitosphere,” comprises a large part of the soil column. The termitosphere intersects with the domain of the humble earthworm, delightfully referred to as the “drilosphere.”

Jouquet detailed how termite activity in the termitosphere affects the amount of water retained in the soil and changes the soil structure, increasing vegetation growth and cover. Termites even affect the biodiversity of animals in their community. Their mounds provide food and shelters for many animals in times of drought and scarcity, protecting organisms from local extinction.

Above all, termites are important decomposers. Feeding on dead plant material including wood and leaf litter, the impact of termites is especially pronounced in arid and dry conditions. The lack of humidity prevents other decomposers such as flies from doing their jobs, but termites have a secret weapon in the form of their mound. A termite mound can essentially be temperature and humidity controlled, allowing termites to efficiently decompose natural materials throughout harsh conditions.

Historically, termite range has been limited by temperature and humidity. According to a new study from Amy Zanne and her international team of researchers, climate change may increase termites' range significantly as average temperatures rise.

Termite wood discovery, where termite colonies locate a new resource, and consumption are heavily dependent on temperature. Zanne’s team found that discovery increased dramatically with temperature, increasing over seven times per 10 degree Celsius increase in temperature. Overall, discovery was greatest, but highly variable, at low latitudes and elevations where temperature and precipitation were high. The same pattern was also observed in reverse, where discovery was west in cool, temperate biomes.

Zanne's team's research estimates termite expansion could increase by 50% from 2041 to 2060 based on current climate predictions. This expansion will affect carbon cycling and wood decomposition in ways we will continue to study in the future.

Termites, however, may become a new threat — or boon — to many tropical ecosystems in the coming years. Termites are here to stay.

Most people think termites are a nuisance that consume wood in homes and businesses. But, these termites represent less than 4 percent of all termite species worldwide.

Termites are critical in natural ecosystems—especially in the tropics—because they help recycle dead wood from trees. Without such decayers, the world would be piled high with dead plants and animals.

But these energetic wood-consuming insects could soon be moving toward the North and South poles as global temperatures warm from climate change, new research indicates.

In a new international study led by University of Miami biology professor Amy Zanne, researchers learned that termites are pivotal when it comes to breaking down wood, contributing to the earth's carbon cycle. They also learned that termites are very sensitive to temperature and rainfall, so as temperatures heat up, the insect's role in wood decay will likely expand beyond the tropics.

""With temperatures warming, the impact of termites on the planet could be huge,"" said Zanne, the Aresty Chair of Tropical Ecology in the College of Arts and Sciences' Department of Biology.

For the study, published in the journal Science, Zanne, along with more than 100 collaborators, studied locations across the globe where bacteria and fungi (microbes) and termites consume dead wood. They also investigated how temperature and rainfall could impact the discovery and decay of wood by using the same experimental set up at more than 130 sites in a variety of habitats across six continents. Their results suggest that areas with high termite activity should increase as the earth becomes warmer and drier.

""Termites had their biggest effects in places like tropical savannas and seasonal forests and subtropical deserts,"" Zanne added. ""These systems are often underappreciated in terms of their contributions to the global carbon budget.""

Amy Austin, associate professor of ecology at Universidad de Buenos Aires, and a collaborator of Zanne's, said the global study helped scientists glean broader insight about wood decay.

""The inclusion of arid, hot bioregions, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere, where termites are often plentiful and active, allowed for novel insight into their role in carbon turnover,"" Austin said. ""As ecologists, we may need to broaden our consideration of woody ecosystems beyond a closed-canopy forest and recognize that woody carbon stores in drier ecosystems are an important component of the global carbon cycle.""

Although microbes and termites both decompose dead wood, there are important differences between them. While microbes need water to grow and consume wood, termites can function at relatively low moisture levels. In fact, termites can search for their next meal even if it is dry out and carry what they want back to their mounds, or even move their colony into the wood they are consuming.

""Microbes are globally important when it comes to wood decay, but we have largely overlooked the role of termites in this process. This means we are not accounting for the massive effect these insects could pose for future carbon cycling and interactions with climate change,"" Zanne added.

Like little cows, termites release carbon from the wood as methane and carbon dioxide, which are two of the most important greenhouse gases. Therefore, Zanne said that termites may increasingly contribute to greenhouse gas emissions with climate change.

""I am fascinated by how microbial and termite wood decay affect how carbon is being released back into the environment,"" added Zanne, who has been studying the feedbacks from wood-based carbon release for more than a decade.

Zanne began her research on termites in 2008, connecting with other wood decay experts as she attended a working group in Sydney, Australia. That led to a large research project in Queensland, Australia, which even included collaborating with artist Donna Davis to portray termites, microbes, and decaying wood.

She expanded the study globally through social media and word of mouth, including researchers across career stages and locations with everyone running the same experiment using locally-sourced materials.

André M. D'Angioli, a Brazilian biologist, collaborated on the project as part of his doctoral dissertation at Universidade Estadual de Campinas.

""Being involved in the global wood project was a major step for my research,"" he said. ""It was fascinating to see how the regional-scale data I collected in Brazil was related to the global patterns found in this paper.""

Zanne said the chance to spearhead a global-scale research endeavor was extremely rewarding.

""This is one of the most incredible projects I've worked on,"" said Zanne. ""It was a truly international collaboration. Our ability to better understand wood decay and parts of the carbon cycle at a global scale is now stronger because of this research.""

The study, ""Termites sensitivity to temperature affects global wood decay rates,"" was published in the Sept. 23 edition of Science.

Organizers also urged voters to always cast their ballot with climate in mind.

Climat GO had two further demands: massively tax the rich and reinvest that money into social programs to ensure decent conditions for all and ban all fossil fuels by 2030.

In front of the lofty Gothic architecture of the Peace Tower, two Algonquin leaders celebrated the demonstrators acting on behalf of the land, waters and future generations.

“I’m out here to speak specifically about the water and how important the water is,” Kyoki Whiteduck, a community member from Kitigan Zibi Anishinabeg and food and climate educator for the Ajashki food security project, said. “Water is life.”

“It’s overlooked here in Canada… People disregard it so much because we have so much,” he added.

Whiteduck’s advocacy comes from the teachings of his grandmother, who was a water keeper in charge of all water ceremonies and advocated for its importance.

“Indigenous rights is environmentalism,” he said, pointing to a desire for First Nations Peoples to have clean water and clean hunting grounds.

For Elder Claudette Commanda, who gave a passionate speech with two eagle feathers and a pouch of tobacco clutched in her hand, the climate is all of creation, including us.

“For me, as an Anishinaabe person, when you say climate, when you say environment, it means the land and all of every creation that’s attached to the land,” Commanda told Canada’s National Observer.

“Nature was the first creation here, so when you destroy nature, you're destroying yourself.”

It’s refreshing for Commanda to see so many non-Indigenous folks advocate not just for the land but also for Indigenous Peoples’ relationship to the land. It’s a change in the environmentalist movement she’s seen in her lifetime.

Years ago, Indigenous Peoples weren’t even included, she said, but now environmentalists are reaching out because they have no choice. Indigenous Peoples’ knowledge and understanding of natural law, given by the Creator, make them an essential voice in the movement, she said. “[Environmentalists] couldn’t create awareness or make change without our people.”

For Alex Silas, regional executive vice-president of the Public Service Alliance of Canada, labour organizers must put themselves front and centre in the environmental movement. In a speech at Confederation Park, he warned the crowd about bad-faith corporate greenwashing and privatized solutions to the climate crisis.

“As workers, we can’t let the green future be led by the corporate class,” Silas said. “We need to go into a direction grounded on communities, on families and on workers.”

It’s important for labour advocates to remain engaged in the struggle for a green transition to ensure it includes unionized jobs and decent work conditions, he said.

Labour’s organizing power can push for a just transition away from fossil fuels, Silas added.

“If you look at any major progressive change in society throughout history, the labour movement has to be right there,” he said. “This has to be a movement based on people and based on workers.”

Kaia Thomas, a 17-year-old student at Glebe Collegiate, can’t vote yet, but she can protest on Parliament Hill in front of hundreds of people to make her voice heard.

Not being able to cast a ballot in federal elections “really motivated me to want to speak,” she said.

“I don’t think people understand how dire the situation is. Hopefully, I inspired people to vote for climate, to vote for people who care about these issues.”

f4298a5e-6d9f-476c-bb15-8ff016a854b2,"Evanston Township High School students joined others to participate in a global climate strike in Chicago on Friday. The protesters advocated for investment in sustainable solutions.

Evanston Township High School students joined about 250 people to protest for divestment from fossil fuels at this year’s Fridays For Future global climate strike at Pritzker Park.

Activist Greta Thunberg’s youth-led climate organization, Fridays For Future, sponsored the global strike that took place across the globe. Friday’s strike in Chicago was centered around the theme “#PeopleNotProfit.”

Demonstrators marched downtown to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago to protest the role of banks in the climate crisis. They called for divestment from fossil fuels, regulation of fossil fuel financing and investment in sustainable climate change solutions. The protesters stopped at the Federal Plaza and adjacent Chase Bank before returning to Pritzker Park.

Danica Sun, co-head of the Fridays for Future Chicago chapter and Climate Chicago Youth Coalition, said the protest was also specifically advocating against a bill recently introduced by Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV). Sun said the current legislation would invest in fossil fuel infrastructure.

“We were really urging people to call their representatives and tell them to vote that (bill) out,” Sun said.

Erris Maguire, a leader of ETHS-based climate activist group E-Town Sunrise, said there was a large youth presence at Friday’s protest from multiple Chicago-area schools. Maguire’s group works locally with the city government and community to advocate for better climate legislation that creates lasting change, she said.

It is important for youth to organize, she said, because they are the ones that will bear the brunt of future catastrophic climate events.

“Our generation as a whole is really afraid and really concerned for the future,” Magurie said. “I know that everyone in our group really cares a lot about Evanston and wants to see Evanston taking real steps to fight the climate crisis.”

The climate strike began with a staged flash mob to the song “Stayin’ Alive” by the Bee Gees. Maguire said the song choice was intentional to emphasize that the climate crisis is about life and death. The protesters then performed a “die-in,” lying on the ground for two minutes. Participants stood in solidarity with people who have died from natural disasters and climate related issues, Maguire said.

After she led chants at Friday’s protest for two hours, Sun said she felt high school students should not have to protest against climate change. But adults in power failed to protect the environment, she added, so participating in strikes and advocacy events is now necessary for the future of the planet.

“(Generations before us) created an environment where my generation doesn’t feel like we have a safe and sustainable future, so we have to step up and do what they aren’t doing,” Sun said.

Carla Winterbottom, a protester with the environmental group Extinction Rebellion, said that the world is experiencing the effects of climate change.

As she protests alongside groups of students and young people, Winterbottom said she is heartbroken for the next generation. She said that the current state of the climate often leads people to experience anxiety and fear for the future.

“Action addresses eco-anxiety,” Winterbottom said. “It’s not the environment. It’s our environment. We all need to gather together.”

NEW YORK (AP) — Frustrated, anxious but also a tad hopeful, young activists staged a coordinated “global climate strike” Friday to highlight the effects of global warming and demand more aid for poor countries hit by wild weather.

In New York, as leaders of developing disaster-struck nations pleaded their cases at the United Nations, more than a thousand protesters, many of them skipping school, marched through the streets to tell their leaders they were sick of inaction on climate.

""The oceans are rising and so are we,” they chanted. Protesters also took to the streets in Jakarta, Tokyo, Rome, Berlin and Montreal carrying banners and posters with slogans such as, “It’s not too late.”

“It’s one thing to worry about the future, and it’s another to get out there and do something about it,” said 16-year-old Lucia Dec-Prat at the protest in New York. “I honestly feel that the adults aren’t listening.”

Dinah Landsman, 17, said every day she asks herself about what kind of future she'll have as she grows up because of climate change. Her generation has to act, she said.

“No one else is going to do it,” said Landsman, also in New York. “It's us who have the most at stake.”

The protests follow warnings from scientists that countries aren’t doing enough to meet the 2015 Paris climate accord’s top-line target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) this century compared to preindustrial times.

Michael Taft, a 27-year-old graduate student in New York, said “a lot of kids here are scared about what the next 20 years are going to look like for them.”

But Taft said he still has hope. He looks around at those listening to the speakers and said they aren’t like past generations. They aren’t looking to become finance majors and make lots of money.

“They’re all here because they’re motivated to make change,” Taft said. “And probably one of the people here or in another climate rally in a different country is going to be the person that has a massive role in change and fixing this.""

The demonstrations were organized by the Fridays for Future movement that took its cue from activist Greta Thunberg, who began protesting alone outside the Swedish parliament in 2018.

“We're striking all over the world because the governments in charge are still doing too little for climate justice,"" said Darya Sotoodeh, a spokesperson for the group's chapter in Germany.

“People all over the world are suffering from this crisis, and it's going to get worse if we don't act on time,"" she said.

Police said some 20,000 people attended the rally in Berlin, which featured calls for the German government to establish a 100-billion-euro fund for tackling climate change.

In Rome, some 5,000 young people turned out for a march that ended near the Colosseum.

One placard read: “The climate is changing. Why aren’t we?” Students highlighted among their priorities the need to rethink Italy’s transport policies. The country's ratio of cars to inhabitant is one of the highest in Europe.

In Italy’s election campaign, which wraps up on Friday evening ahead of the Sept. 25 vote for Parliament, climate change policies didn’t figure heavily at candidates’ rallies.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told world leaders this week that the fossil fuel industry, which is responsible for a large share of planet-warming gases, is “feasting on hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies and windfall profits while household budgets shrink and our planet burns.""

Guterres urged rich countries to tax the profits of energy companies and redirect the funds to both “countries suffering loss and damage caused by the climate crisis” and those struggling with the rising cost of living.

Demands for poor nations to receive greater financial help to cope with global warming, including the destruction already wrought by deadly weather events such as the floods in Pakistan, have grown louder in the run-up to this year's U.N. climate summit.

Youth activists across the world have staged a coordinated ‘global climate strike’ to highlight their fears about the effects of global warming and demand more aid for poor countries hit by wild weather.

Protesters in Jakarta, Tokyo, Rome and Berlin took part in a series of organised walkouts around the world, taking to the streets to demand rich countries pay for the damage global heating is inflicting on the poor’.

The demonstrations were organised by the Fridays For Future youth movement, which planned protests in over 450 locations worldwide.

The youth-led group of climate activists take their cue from Greta Thunberg, who began protesting alone outside the Swedish parliament in 2018.

The group has since organised a number of ‘school strikes’ around the world in which they encourage students to skip school on Friday’s in order to participate in demonstrations against climate change and the fossil fuel industry.

‘We’re striking all over the world because the governments in charge are still doing too little for climate justice,’ said Darya Sotoodeh, a spokesperson for the group’s chapter in Germany.

‘People all over the world are suffering from this crisis and it’s going to get worse if we don’t act on time,’ she said.

‘One day, it could be my house that gets flooded,’ 15-year-old Park Chae-yun, one of about 200 student who turned up to protest in Seoul, South Korea.

‘I’m living with a sense of crisis, so I think it is more important to deliver my concerns to the government to take preventive measures rather than going to school’, he told the Guardian.

The biggest strike of the day took place in Berlin, which saw an estimated 20,000 people flood the streets to demand the government establish an emergency €100 billion fund to tackle climate change.

The protests follow warnings from scientists that countries are not doing enough to meet the 2015 Paris climate accord’s top-line target of limiting global warming to 1.5C this century compared to pre-industrial times.

b0d57caf-4d0d-4236-afe8-bb648d96c55d,"“H armony: a new way of Looking At The World” is an arresting read. Published in 2010, the book by Prince Charles, now King Charles, is a peculiar work stretching from ecology to economics, via ancient philosophy and sacred geometry. At times Charles comes across as a regal Jordan Peterson, who researched symbolism before switching to life advice for teenage boys. In one section, the then heir to the throne discusses how often the shape of “the female organ of birth—the doorway or window between two worlds”, as the future king delicately puts it, appears in art, architecture and nature.

But the sections on economic growth stick with the reader longer than Charles’s Freudian analysis of the shape of an almond. Mankind is on a path to misery, expanding gross domestic product at the expense of the environment, argues Charles. An addiction to consumption leaves people stressed. gdp is a 20th-century measure in a 21st-century world. Unfortunately for the new king, a person who takes the opposite view now sits in Downing Street.

Liz Truss has made growth the be-all of her premiership. Boosting trend growth to 2.5% per year, as the government intends, may be a bloodless cry. But it is a loud one. Speaking at the United Nations in New York, Ms Truss hailed gdp as the route to power as well as prosperity, with democracies able to fend off the likes of Vladimir Putin only if they become richer. For Charles, economic growth is the problem. For the prime minister, it is the solution.

Some aspects of the Carolean view are reasonable. Boosting the economy while ignoring environmental harm would be bonkers. Charles notes that increases in gdp stop correlating with increased happiness above a certain level. Sometimes the problem is the messenger more than the message. Arguing that there is more to life than money is a platitude. It is, however, a strange sentiment from a man who lives in a palace.

Ms Truss takes a hard-nosed view of increasing wealth. Charles approvingly quotes Gandhi at his most trite: “Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony”. By contrast, during the leadership campaign, Ms Truss said: “Happiness is a faster-growing private sector than public sector.” The prime minister’s line is unlikely to end up on a fridge magnet, but it is at least feasible.

Consumption is a cause of our ills, argues Charles: “Poverty, stress and ill health…seem reluctant to respond to the cure of yet more consumption.” Economic growth has failed to alleviate these symptoms, he laments. Ms Truss sees consumption as the cure. It is such a fundamental aspect of her ideology that, even with the possibility of blackouts this winter, the government dares not ask people to turn down their thermostats and throw on jumpers. “Ever since I can remember, the environment has been presented as something worthy,” complained Ms Truss in a speech she made while environment secretary in 2014. “Feel guilty about buying more stuff. Take fewer flights. It’s all been about having less but it can—and should—be about having more.” (It is a mark of the straitened times that keeping the heat on has replaced flying as an aspiration.)

Ms Truss is right that unless Britain boosts its lousy growth rate, decline will follow. But the unelected monarch is, unfortunately, with the people in opposing the measures that would do just that. Strict planning laws make it difficult to build, which is just the way voters want it. Ms Truss cheered as towers sprang up across Britain’s cities; Charles led a popular backlash against them. Many voters like to say, as he did, that they are happy to give up on growth if it means a greener future.

Politicians of all stripes console themselves with the notion that Britons voted to leave the eu in 2016 because they were misled by other, less upstanding politicians. “No one voted to be poorer,” runs the refrain. A scarier possibility is that people knew perfectly well what they voted for. Brexit will create a smaller economy, but voters simply did not care. Palace-dwellers are not the only people who are insulated from economic shocks. Home-owning pensioners are pretty well protected, too.

It is little wonder that previous governments placed growth as a second-order issue to a higher purpose. Margaret Thatcher sold her radical reshaping of the state as something that went far beyond economics. “Economics are the method,” she said. “The object is to change the heart and soul.” Improved public services was the primary focus under Tony Blair’s government, economic growth simply the means of paying for it. Under David Cameron, economic growth would be a happy consequence of cutting the deficit. For Ms Truss, growth is the only goal. It is unlikely to be an innately popular one.

Give me growth or give me death

Ms Truss professes to be unfussed about a backlash. “Not every measure will be popular,” she said. “And there are always vested interests, people who oppose measures that increase economic growth.” So corporation taxes will be cut, and a popular (though foolish) cap on bankers’ bonuses will go. Plans to overhaul planning rules are mooted. Individually, each policy would turn a focus group into a lynch mob; doing all of them together is brave to the point of foolhardy. Ms Truss resembles a neoliberal kamikaze pilot, prepared to blow herself up for a righteous cause.

Criticism will not come from the new occupant of Buckingham Palace. Charles is wiser than that. A Prince of Wales has a limited right to sound off on topics such as the environment or the joys of organic marmalade, but a monarch must keep quiet. Charles has promised he will keep his views on economic growth, the curves of a Stradivarius and the merits of Thomas Malthus to himself. Some causes may miss his voice. But when it comes to growth-boosting reforms, Charles has no need to pipe up. Most likely, the voters will do it for him. ■

e86d38b0-2c7d-43e2-a6b2-9f57bd7a3096,"Andrew Marr, the former BBC political editor and presenter, is a man I like and admire.

So it saddens me to see that he appears to have launched a campaign to encourage our new King to become the focal point of opposition to the policies of our equally new Prime Minister.

In his column for the preeminent left-of-centre magazine, the New Statesman, Marr declared that the current state of politics in the UK had caused him to 'rethink some of what I have written before about the man who is now King Charles. Like many, I've always argued that on the throne he must relinquish his previous views and campaigning… a King who meddles in politics would seem to be in particular danger'.

A friend who knows both Truss and King Charles quite well explained to me just how diametrically opposed the two are in their world view: 'He is a romantic pastoralist. She is all about ruthless efficiency, and has no great attachment to the countryside: she sees it purely as a means of production'

Now, however, Marr has decided that 'to put it bluntly, Right-wing ministers thinking about a difficult election in 2024 and with a record of hostility to 'green c**p', can't be trusted. A King who feels differently … might be the best short-term argument for the monarchy'.

A week later, Marr spied the opportunity for Sir Keir Starmer to identify Labour's opposition to Liz Truss's policies with Buckingham Palace.

Prophet

This would be achieved, he said, not just by opening the party's annual conference with a rendition of God Save The King (now done) but also 'the apparent determination of the new government to ditch net zero [carbon emissions] — something the King will loathe — gives Labour a great opportunity'.

The King's Party, no less. But the leader of the Liberal Democrat Party, Sir Ed Davey, is also bidding for the political equivalent of a royal warrant.

Television cameras recorded the opening of his meeting (along with other opposition party leaders) with Charles III in the week of the Queen's death. The BBC's microphones picked up the opening words between the two men.

King Charles: 'I have not seen you for far too long.' Sir Ed Davey: 'I would love to come to talk to you about similar issues on the environment and climate change in due course.'

Those are the issues which have long gripped the King, and on which he counts himself as a prophet, so this was doubtless music to royal ears.

Andrew Marr, the former BBC political editor and presenter, is a man I like and admire. So it saddens me to see that he appears to have launched a campaign to encourage our new King to become the focal point of opposition to the policies of our equally new Prime Minister

As Energy and Climate Change Secretary in the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government, it was Davey who, in 2012, imposed the regulation which required companies fracking for gas to halt work if their drilling triggered tremors over 0.5 magnitude on the Richter scale.

That is vastly more restrictive than the limits imposed on other extractive industries, and put a stop to the whole business. Indeed, in 2019 Davey told a Channel 4 interviewer: 'I'm very proud that you're looking at the person who basically stopped the fracking industry in this country.'

But Liz Truss has immediately scrapped that rule, as part of her drive to boost British gas production: sensibly so, as the logical response to the crisis caused by over-reliance in Europe on gas from Russia is to produce more of our own.

The new Truss administration has also ditched schemes intended to block North Sea oil and gas projects deemed 'incompatible' with our 'net zero' commitments.

No doubt, all this will give King Charles conniptions — and even more if Truss agrees to the onshore gas companies' request that their projects are designated as 'nationally strategic infrastructure', which would short-circuit the otherwise painfully slow planning process.

Sir Ed Davey meeting Prince Charles on September 10. The monarch opened their conversation by saying: 'I have not seen you for far too long.' Sir Ed responded: 'I would love to come to talk to you about similar issues on the environment and climate change in due course'

This would be in line with what the Chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, announced last week: a total of 40 new 'investment zones' across England, where existing habitat planning regulations would be eased, to promote growth.

This, along with other de-regulation promised by Liz Truss, provoked the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds to issue the following (hysterical) statement: 'Where you live, the wildlife and places you love, from the shires to the cities — all under threat from bulldozers, from concrete.'

Romantic

That might tear at King Charles's heartstrings but it will bother Truss not one whit. In yesterday's Mail on Sunday, she wrote that her administration would be 'focusing relentlessly on economic growth… Everything we do will be tested against whether it helps our economy to grow or holds it back'.

For King Charles, however, growth is the problem, not the solution. He has long believed this, declaring in a speech in 2009 that 'nature' could not survive the quest for 'unlimited growth' and that 'poverty, stress and ill-health … seem reluctant to respond to the cure of yet more consumption'.

Five years later, as Environment Secretary, Liz Truss issued a pointed rebuttal to that philosophy, criticising the call to 'feel guilty about buying more stuff', and adding: 'It's all been about having less, but it can — and should — be about having more.'

As this former declared republican (when a student politician) might have been thinking, but wouldn't say: it's easy for people living in inheritance tax-exempt palaces to denounce 'having more'; but how can the state fund the better public services the public demands, if not through economic growth?

A friend who knows both Truss and King Charles quite well explained to me just how diametrically opposed the two are in their world view: 'He is a romantic pastoralist. She is all about ruthless efficiency, and has no great attachment to the countryside: she sees it purely as a means of production.'

But will this provoke Charles to play the role demanded by Andrew Marr and the ecologically-minded British journalist Aris Roussinos? He wrote on the UnHerd website last week that 'our constitution grants our monarch greater power than the Queen chose to exercise, and we are fortunate that our new King possesses a willingness to intercede in public life'.

My friend, who has experience of the interactions between Buckingham Palace and the Palace of Westminster, thinks not: 'Charles will try very hard to restrain himself. And his team will help him try to hide the strength of his feelings. He will take the advice to be circumspect.

Dangerous

'The thing is, even if he felt particularly upset by the policies of his Prime Minister, what could he actually do? Even if he was being implored by the RSPB or the Wildfowl And Wetland Trust to stop her plans to demolish obstacles to development in rural areas, what could he do? He might grumble over a drink with Rory Stewart [the former Tory cabinet minister who tutored Princes William and Harry], but nothing would happen.'

We have Charles's word for that. In a television interview to mark his 70th birthday in 2018, asked if he would intervene in issues as King, in the way he did as Prince of Wales, he responded: 'I'm not that stupid. I do realise that it is a separate exercise, being Sovereign. I understand entirely how that should operate.'

And in the week his mother died, Charles pledged to 'maintain the precious principles of constitutional government which lie at the heart of our nation'. That, as Winston Churchill once summarised it, is 'the separation of pomp from power'.

It would be immensely dangerous, above all for the institution of the monarchy, if Charles were seduced by Marr, or any of the King's many admirers within the environmentalist movement, into putting what they regard as duty to the planet ahead of duty to the democratic constitutional order he has sworn to uphold.

It is true the new King has a mystical view of monarchy and its connections with the eternal interests of humanity as a whole. But a previous King Charles, convinced of the imperative of his own divine insights, paid the ultimate price for challenging Parliament.

And while it is fashionable to point out that Truss has not won a general election, her status legitimately rests on being the leader of a parliamentary majority.

The man wore a white shirt with the words ""end UK private jets"" written on it. He was quickly escorted off the court after the fire was put out by officials.

The protest temporarily halted the singles match between Stefanos Tsitsipas and Diego Schwartzman. He reportedly ran onto the court after Tsitsipas won the first set and set his arm on fire before security grabbed him. After officials determined the fire did not alter the court, the match resumed and Tsitsipas won the second set to clinch the victory.

“It came out of nowhere. I have no idea what this is all about. I never had an incident like this happen on court. I hope he is all right,” Tsitsipas said, according to The Guardian. “I wanted to proceed the match without having any minor changes to the court and to make sure it was playable, especially that area. It also got in my way of viewing experience, the way I saw the court later. There was a big mark over there and I just wanted to get it cleared up.”

01e4921f-4690-4ee6-b9c3-07c7765d9d80,"Roger Federer was unable to bring the curtain down on his illustrious career with one final victory after he suffered defeat in the doubles at the Laver Cup to ensure a dramatic opening day ended level at 2-2.

The 20-time grand-slam champion teamed up with old-rival Rafael Nadal for his 'last dance' in London but saw his dream finale ruined by Jack Sock and Frances Tiafoe, who won 4-6 7-6 (7-2) 11-9 to dampen spirits at the O2.

Spectators inside the venue had been stunned earlier in the day when a protester ran onto the court and set fire to his arm in a protest against private jets being used in the UK.

It was a distant memory by the time Federer had started to roll back the years but he could not maintain a strong start with Team World able to level up the scores after Team Europe had opened up a 2-0 lead at the start of the day.

This Ryder Cup-style team competition was the brainchild of the Swiss star and first started in 2017 with a format which sees six of the best players from Europe take on six counterparts from the rest of the world across a mixture of singles' and doubles' contests over three days.

Federer had to bend his own rules to feature in only a doubles contest due to his troublesome knee injury but produced several highlights in two hours and 14 minutes of action before he bowed out from competitive tennis following a lengthy hug with old adversary Nadal and another standing ovation.

A marathon two-hour-and-29-minute clash between Andy Murray and Alex de Minaur kicked off the evening session with the Team World player winning 5-7 6-3 10-7 to get the visitors on the board.

Double Wimbledon champion Murray had displayed plenty of his trademark defence during a lengthy battle but it was the Australian who held his nerve in the 10-point tie-breaker.

""I just wanted to do anything I could to get the win for my team and I managed to find a way,"" de Minaur said on-court.

""I don't know how much tactics were out there. It was be ready for a battle and for however long it took. Andy is a hell of a player, he has done so much for the sport and it is just great to have him around.""

A protester had grabbed the headlines during the afternoon session when he set fire to his arm in an act to highlight the climate issues surrounding private jets being used in the UK.

It was during a changeover between sets in Stefanos Tsitsipas' 6-2 6-1 win over Diego Schwartzman that the spectator raced onto the black court and briefly had his arm ablaze before security were able to step in.

Tsitsipas admitted: ""It came out of nowhere. I have no idea what this is all about. I never had an incident like this happen on court. I hope he is all right.""

Victory for Tsitsipas followed up Casper Ruud's thrilling 6-4 5-7 10-7 success over Sock at the beginning of day one .

Ruud received in-game coaching from his Team Europe colleagues, notably Nadal, and said: ""Obviously I was focused about the match and trying to win it but it is fun, you turn around and have Rafa on one side and Roger on the other trying to help."""

A protester lit a portion of the court and his arm on fire during a match at the Laver Cup tennis event Friday, hours before Roger Federer was scheduled to play for the final time before retiring.

The episode briefly delayed the action at the start of the second set of Stefanos Tsitsipas' 6-2, 6-1 victory for Team Europe over Diego Schwartzman of Team World at the O2 Arena.

The activist, carrying a lighter and wearing a white T-shirt with a message about private jets, made his way onto the black court and sat down near the net. The person eventually was carried away by security guards.

“It came out of nowhere. ... I never had an incident like this happen on court,” Tsitsipas, the runner-up at the 2021 French Open, said afterward. “I hope he's all right.”

Tsitsipas spoke to the chair umpire to make sure it would be safe to continue to play and asked that a mark left on the court be cleaned up.

The protester “has been arrested and the situation is being handled by the police,” Laver Cup organisers said in a statement.

Federer, a 20-time Grand Slam champion, was slated to compete hours later Friday, teaming up with longtime rival Rafael Nadal in a doubles match.

The 41-year-old Federer hasn't played an official match since Wimbledon in July 2021 and is ending his playing career after a series of operations on his right knee.

There have been other instances of high-profile tennis matches being interrupted in recent years, including during the 2009 final at Roland Roland Garros, when a man went up to Federer and tried to put a hat on his head.

At this year's French Open, in June, a protester wearing a T-shirt with the message “We have 1028 days left” interrupted the men’s semifinal between Casper Ruud and 2014 U.S. Open champion Marin Cilic by attaching herself to the net with metal wires and glue and kneeling on the court.

The incident unfolded at London’s O2 during the opening session of the Laver Cup match between Stefanos Tsitsipas and Diego Schwartzman, with a man running on court at changeover after the first set.

Wearing a T-shirt which read “End UK Private Jets”, the man sparked the fire on the playing surface near the net. It then spread to his arm, but luckily did not go any further and was soon out.

One of three security workers used their jacket to extinguish the fire still burning on the court before the man was carried out of the arena.

Local police said the man, who was taken to hospital as a precaution, was arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass.

It failed to knock world No.6 Tsitsipas off his stride with the Greek despatching Schwartzman 6-2 6-1, but Tsitsipas admitted he was shocked.

“It came out of nowhere. I have no idea what this is all about. I never had an incident like this happen on court. I hope he is all right,” Tsitsipas said.

Despite a promising start in which they claimed the first set, the star duo was eventually overcome by the US pairing of Jack Sock and Frances Tiafoe in three: 4-6 7-6 (7-2) 11-9.

It brought a close to Federer’s stunning career, which includes 20 grand slams, at the age of 41.

Earlier Aussie Alex de Minaur overcame Andy Murray in a marathon Laver Cup tie to break local hearts.

The Australian won 5-7 6-3 10-7 in two hours and 29 minutes to open the account of Team World against Team Europe, reducing the deficit at 2-1 to Europe after three singles ties on day one.

Both players were evenly matched with Minaur winning just one more point in the match, but the world No.22 converted three of five break points compared to Murray’s two from seven."

The United Nations has ruled Australia failed to protect Torres Strait Islanders against the impacts of climate change and thus violated their right to enjoy their culture.

The decision, by the UN's human rights committee, follows a 2019 complaint by eight Australian nationals and six of their children from four small, low-lying islands.

The inhabitants of Boigu, Poruma, Warraber and Masig claimed their rights had been violated as the Morrison government failed to adapt to upgrade seawalls on the islands and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

'The committee has created a pathway for individuals to assert claims where national systems have failed to take appropriate measures to protect those most vulnerable to the negative impacts of climate change on the enjoyment of their human rights,' committee member Hélène Tigroudja said on Friday evening.

The decision, by the UN's human rights committee, follows a 2019 complaint by eight Australian nationals and six of their children from four small, low-lying islands

The Islanders claimed changes in weather patterns have had direct harmful consequences on their livelihood, culture and traditional way of life.

Flooding caused by tidal surges has destroyed graves and left human remains scattered across the islands, while heavy rain and storms have degraded the land reduced food available from fishing and farming.

On Masig Island, the rising sea has caused saltwater to seep into the soil and coconut trees to become diseased.

The committee said despite Australia's construction of new seawalls on the four islands expected to be completed by 2023, additional measures were required.

The UN has asked Australia to compensate the Islanders for harm suffered, consult to assess their needs and take measures to continue to secure the communities' safe existence.

The committee's decision demonstrated an international concern that policy should be led by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's solutions, the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Service said.

The inhabitants of Boigu, Poruma, Warraber and Masig claimed their rights had been violated as the Morrison government failed to adapt to upgrade seawalls on the islands and reduce greenhouse gas emissions

'We have a right to culture.

'What needs to be in reverence is the principle that culture is a strengthening agent and that should underpin the delivery of services, policy and legislation that affects Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People.

'There should be nothing about us or our country, without us'.

The Climate Council welcomed the ruling, with director of research Dr Simon Bradshaw saying the loss and damage experienced by Torres Islanders 'epitomises the injustice at the the heart of the climate crisis'.

Climate change undermines not only physical security but is a profound threat to culture and the deep connections of communities to their land and sea, he said.

'The Australian government must do everything it can to limit future harms by ensuring Australia's emissions plummet this decade, leaving fossil fuels in the ground and providing far greater support to communities in the Torres Strait with adapting to the impacts of climate change.'"

Australia violated the human rights of a group of islanders off its north coast by failing to adequately protect them from the effects of climate change, a United Nations committee has found.

The complaint, filed more than three years ago by eight Torres Strait Islanders and their children, is one of a growing body of climate cases being brought around the world on human rights grounds, and the ruling is expected to embolden others.

Rising sea levels have already damaged food sources and ancestral burial sites, scattering human remains, the islanders argued, saying their homes are at risk of being submerged.

The committee said Australia violated two of the three human rights set out in a UN Treaty, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966), pertaining to culture and family life, but not article 6 on the right to life, media reports on Friday revealed.

It called for Australia to provide the islanders with an effective remedy.

“This decision marks a significant development as the committee has created a pathway for individuals to assert claims where national systems have failed to take appropriate measures to protect those most vulnerable to the negative impacts of climate change on the enjoyment of their human rights,” UN committee member Hélène Tigroudja said.

A spokesperson for Australia’s energy and climate change ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

No enforcement mechanism

Torres Strait Islanders are part of Australia’s Indigenous population, along with Aboriginal people, who live on small clusters of low-lying islands dotted between Australia and Papua New Guinea.

The case was filed when the former conservative government – seen as a laggard in the battle against climate change – was in power. Since then, parliament has passed legislation on emissions cuts and Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen has visited the islands this year.

Some 173 of the 193 UN member states have ratified the Covenant, including Australia. There is no enforcement mechanism but there are follow-up steps and states generally comply with the committee’s findings.

GENEVA, Sept 23 (Reuters) - A United Nations committee found on Friday that Australia had violated the human rights of a group of islanders off its north coast by failing to adequately protect them from the impacts of climate change, such as by cutting greenhouse gas emissions.

The complaint, filed over three years ago by eight Torres Strait Islanders and their children, is one of a growing body of climate cases being brought around the world on human rights grounds, and the ruling is expected to embolden others.

Rising sea levels have already damaged food sources and ancestral burial sites, scattering human remains, the islanders argued, saying their homes are at risk of being submerged.

""I know that our ancestors are rejoicing knowing that Torres Strait Islander voices are being heard throughout the world through this landmark case,"" said Yessie Mosby, a Kulkalgal man and Traditional Owner on the island of Masig who is a claimant in the case. ""This win gives us hope that we can protect our island homes, culture and traditions for our kids and future generations to come,"" he said.

Environmental charity ClientEarth working with the claimants said it was the first legal action brought by climate-vulnerable inhabitants of small islands against a nation state, setting several precedents.

The Committee said Australia had violated two of the three human rights set out in a U.N. Treaty, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966), pertaining to culture and family life, but not article 6 on the right to life.

It called for Australia to provide the islanders with an effective remedy.

Australia's Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus said in emailed comments to Reuters that the government was working with the islanders on climate change and stressed that the case predated the current administration.

""The Australian Government is considering the Committee's views and will provide its response in due course,"" he added.

31e3e5fa-68a3-4bb2-bfe1-8cbfab79f677,"David Malpass, president of the World Bank, faces an uncertain future this week, after the White House joined a chorus of influential figures in condemning his apparent climate denialism.

Malpass remains in post for now but under severe pressure, despite issuing an apology and trying to explain his refusal last week to publicly acknowledge the human role in the climate crisis.

The Biden administration stepped into the row on Friday evening, when the press secretary for the US president told journalists: “We disagree with the comments made by president Malpass. We expect the World Bank to be a global leader of climate ambition and mobilisation, as well as significantly more finance for developing countries… We condemn the words of the president.”

Such strong words from the White House come as a major blow to Malpass, who was appointed to the role in 2019 by Donald Trump, under a longstanding convention by which the World Bank chief is chosen by the US president. Biden’s spokesperson left open the possibility that Malpass could be removed, if other countries agree.

Joe Biden’s press secretary said: ‘We disagree with the comments made by president Malpass.’

Mark Malloch-Brown, president of the Open Society Foundations, former administrator of the UN Development Programme and deputy secretary-general of the UN, told the Observer: “We are relieved to see World Bank president David Malpass apologise for his statements. But a real apology would be much greater action by the World Bank to tackle climate change. The Bank is being far too conservative in its approach to financing, and far too unambitious in its leadership in addressing this existential crisis.”

The World Bank holds its annual meetings in three weeks, where Malpass can expect a further barrage of criticism, if he is still in post.

Talk had circulated for years that Malpass, like many Trump supporters, was a dismisser of climate science. He had already lost the confidence of many key figures in climate diplomacy, because of the World Bank’s failure in the last few years to mobilise the billions of dollars needed to help developing countries cut their greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of global heating.

The open row began on Tuesday, when former US vice-president Al Gore publicly complained at a New York Times event on the fringes of the UN General Assembly in New York that it was “ridiculous to have a climate denier as head of the World Bank”. Malpass was then confronted at a later event that day by New York Times journalist David Gelles, who asked him whether he accepted climate science.

Malpass tried to bat away Gelles’ questions, but eventually answered: “I don’t even know, I am not a scientist and that is not a question.”

Concerns over the direction of the World Bank have sprung from its repeated failures to adopt a strong action plan on the climate crisis, despite pleas from the UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres for the Bank to lead on climate finance.

Hundreds of billions of dollars in investment are needed to shift the world to a low-carbon footing, but these investments could also transform the fortunes of developing countries by improving their infrastructure and economies, as well as people’s health and wellbeing. Most development economists and developing nations see the World Bank as the prime institution for leading such investment, a position embraced by the previous president Jim Yong Kim, appointed by Barack Obama.

Under Malpass, many felt the Bank seemed to step back from this role, and continued to fund fossil fuels.

Privately, staff at the Bank are understood to be dismayed at the distraction, and the lack of support and leadership they feel from the top.

A spokesperson for the World Bank told the Observer: “The World Bank Group is the largest multilateral funder of climate investments in developing countries. Under the leadership of David Malpass, the World Bank Group more than doubled its climate finance, published an ambitious Climate Change Action Plan, and initiated country level diagnostics to support countries’ climate and development goals.”"

John Kerry, the United States special presidential envoy for climate, signaled Tuesday that the Biden administration is working behind the scenes to remove the president of the World Bank, Trump appointee David Malpass. Kerry’s comments came hours after Al Gore, the former US vice president and longtime climate activist, called Malpass “a climate denier” and called on President Joe Biden “to get rid of” him and “put new leadership in” at the world’s largest development bank.

Kerry and Gore were speaking at an event hosted by The New York Times as part of Climate Week NYC, an annual series of public events coinciding with the United Nations General Assembly that aims to galvanize climate action. Malpass, appearing separately from Kerry and Gore at the event, called Gore’s call for his removal “very odd.” On stage, Malpass was asked three times whether he “accepted the scientific consensus that the man-made burning of fossil fuels is rapidly and dangerously warming the planet.” Each time, the World Bank president declined to answer before finally saying, “I don’t even know, and I’m not a scientist.”

“We need to get a new head of the World Bank, for god’s sake,” Gore said before a live audience while answering questions from Somini Sengupta, the Times’ international climate correspondent. In a heated tone, Gore said that “it’s ridiculous to have a climate denier at the head of the World Bank” at a time when poorer countries need affordable loans to install solar and wind facilities rather than burning more coal and other fossil fuels. Covering Climate Now Can Gen Z Save the Midterms for Democrats? Mark Hertsgaard Journalism Turns a Corner on Climate Change Mark Hertsgaard and Kyle Pope Does the Climate Bill Throw Environmental Justice Under the Bus? Mark Hertsgaard More in this series

“If you’re in Nigeria and you want to privately finance a new solar farm,” Gore explained, “you have to pay an interest rate seven times higher than what the OECD [i.e, wealthy] countries pay. If you want to build a wind farm in Brazil, you have to pay interest three times higher than what the US pays.” With 90 percent of future heat-trapping emissions projected to come from developing countries, such unaffordable interest rates imperil the Paris Agreement goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, as scientists say is imperative to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.

Providing loans at more favorable interest rates is “the job of the World Bank, and they’re simply not doing it,” Gore said. “We need to get rid of that leadership and put new leadership in, and I hope President Biden will take that initial step.”

“We will hear from the World Bank president later [today],” Sengupta said.

“Good! Tell him I said hello,” Gore replied, provoking chuckles from the audience. Current Issue View our current issue

“Actually, tell him I said goodbye,” Gore added as the chuckles turned into laughter.

Appearing hours later on the same stage, Kerry made it clear the Biden administration shares Gore’s displeasure with Malpass, whom Trump nominated to head the World Bank in 2019. Formerly the chief economist at Bear Stearns, an investment bank that collapsed during the 2008 financial crisis, Malpass was an economic adviser to Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and later served as President Trump’s undersecretary for international affairs at the Treasury.

Posing a question from the audience, this reporter told Kerry that his former Senate colleague Gore had called on the Biden administration to get Malpass removed before asking Kerry, “Does the administration have confidence in David Malpass as the head of the World Bank?”

“I can’t comment on what the status is of an individual, that is the president’s decision,” Kerry replied. “I will tell you this, though. I have been pushing for months, along with others in the administration, and it’s an open door, not pushing against a shut door…. Earlier today in a meeting we had with a big group of nations talking about development, we made it crystal clear that we need to have major reform and a major restructuring with respect to the multinational development banks.”

Kerry added that the African Development Bank now allocates about 67 percent of its lending to climate, and that the Asia Development Bank is “doing pretty well,” as is the European Development Bank. Notably missing from his list was the World Bank, an absence Kerry alluded to when he added, “If I keep going, you will get a feel for where I am.” Again, laughter rippled through the crowd.

The United States cannot unilaterally remove Malpass; the World Bank’s governing board has the sole authority to select and remove the bank’s president. But Kerry pointed out that the US is the World Bank’s “largest shareholder,” and historically the US has exercised decisive influence over the governing board’s decisions. Citing “the Europeans, our friends, the Germans, the French, the Brits,” Kerry said, “It is up to us to pull people together and get that reform. And [there is] a lot of discussion about doing that right now.”"

Power stations are not included under the safeguard mechanism, which covers industrial plants emitting more than 100,000 tonnes a year of carbon dioxide, but suppliers such as AGL will be affected as an energy supplier to those plants, and because of the government’s economy wide commitments to emissions reduction that also include electricity generation.

AGL accounts for about 8 per cent of Australia’s total carbon emissions, of which more than 95 per cent come from burning coal for the generation of electricity for customers.

The debate over the safeguard mechanism, which covers plants that emit about 28 per cent of the country’s emissions, comes as AGL is struggling to set a fresh strategy to align its business with international climate goals. Its biggest shareholder, software billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes, is pushing for a faster exit from coal power, by 2035, which would bring forward closure dates by up to 10 years in the case of its huge Loy Yang A plant in Victoria.

The embattled generator and retailer is in the middle of a board shake-up, appointing director Patricia McKenzie on Monday as chairman after an original external choice was rebuffed by some major shareholders. An update is due next week on a strategic review it embarked on after the collapse of a demerger plan in late May, which triggered the resignation of then chairman Peter Botten and CEO Graeme Hunt.

On emissions-intensive, trade-exposed (EITE) plants AGL opposed allowing for complex, individually tailored treatment, saying that would be “complicated, expensive, and inefficient”.

It said that while decarbonisation pathways were not clear for some facilities while maintaining full production, that should not justify exemptions from emissions reduction commitments. In that case, further discussion should take place on support mechanisms that could drive the technological innovation to drive down emissions.

AGL also noted it would be critical for additional policies to work alongside the safeguard mechanism to cover emissions from the transport and land sectors and industrial plants not covered by the mechanism so they “can also meaningfully contribute to the overall economy-wide task”.

AGL also warned of the consequences if the safeguard mechanism drives industrial plants to convert Scope 1 emissions from burning fuels such as gas to uncovered Scope 2 emissions from electricity, and provides credits for doing that.

“This could shift a part of the decarbonisation burden onto the electricity sector and risks carbon leakage from the Safeguard if not sufficiently monitored,” it said.

AGL said incentives were needed to drive new renewable energy projects to support the decarbonisation of Scope 2 emissions and suggested that extending the Renewable Energy Target beyond 2030 could help.

The Australian Energy Council, which represents large electricity and gas suppliers, told the government that emissions reduction is “a collective effort” and so the burden needs to be evenly shared across facilities as far as possible.

It said baselines for industrial plants should be set to incentivise the uptake of electrification technologies and criticised the existing policy for providing “excessive headroom” in the baselines that created “a lagging effect” on the uptake of new technologies.

Baselines should therefore be set in a way that “avoids unreasonable headroom being randomly allocated to some facilities”.

“The AEC accepts the need to maintain international competitiveness, but notes the EITE exemption process is ultimately subjective, and an exemption scheme that is too lenient risks placing disproportionate burden on non-EITE facilities that may not be efficient,” AEC policy adviser Rhys Thomas said in the group’s submission."
6bd7921b-bbf6-4686-84c3-6f1d307e1450,"“This will encourage decarbonisation projects investment but allow for the time lag needed for technology development and implementation.”

The Council says special treatment would also prevent so-called “leakage” of emissions, where manufacturing activity that would otherwise happen in Australia would occur overseas where there are no carbon constraints.

Back ‘winners, not losers’

The position puts aluminium producers on a collision course with other sectors and businesses that fall under the safeguard mechanism, which captures 215 of the nation’s biggest carbon emitters. After years of rising emissions under the safeguard, Mr Bowen has promised to make the scheme deliver real reductions as the government pushes to meet its newly legislated 43 per cent emissions reduction target by 2030.

In a submission to the government, the Investor Group on Climate Change said on Thursday that Mr Bowen should support only trade-exposed businesses that have a clear future, and avoid shielding oil and gas.

Erwin Jackson, director of policy at the IGCC, said any safeguard mechanism changes that placed additional unnecessary burdens on other parts of the economy were ultimately against the long-term interests of investors.

“Getting to net zero is challenging and needs a laser focus, and government resources are limited.

“They should be backing the winners in a net-zero world and not the losers.”

The investor group argues that any transitional competitive measures – including direct payments – under the safeguard mechanism changes should be directed at sectors that “have a clear future in an Australian net-zero emissions economy”.

These include renewable energy, critical minerals, and green steel, hydrogen and aluminium.

Support should “not be provided to industries that will decline in a net-zero economy, such as coal and LNG”.

“Support towards these sectors should be limited to the development of near-zero emissions technologies and collaboration to support a just transition for affected employees and communities.”

Australia has four aluminium smelters, as well as downstream processing, that make the metal the nation’s biggest manufacturing export, employing more than 17,000 workers and supporting 60,000 more, according to the Australian Aluminium Council.

‘Substantial’ investment needed

The council said the industry already had some of the lowest emissions in the world, and would need large sources of renewable energy or hydrogen to shift away from gas power and meet zero emissions goals.

“It is hoped that some technologies for refinery digestion may be able to be deployed prior to 2030, however, access to the required infrastructure outside the facility could be the rate-limiting step in the electrification process,” it said in its submission.

“The investment required to implement this transformational abatement will be substantial.

“The focus of policy design for safeguard mechanism should be on establishing a framework to maintain industry, jobs and competitiveness while also decarbonising, through the period to 2030 and beyond to achieve net zero by 2050.

“The success of this policy will not be measured in 2030 alone, but in the transformation of Australia’s industry in the biggest clean industrial and economic revolution this country has seen.”

No longer a need for carve-outs

Mr Jackson countered that the justification for special treatment for trade-exposed facilities had declined in recent years as more economies shifted to carbon pricing.

“We’ve seen an acceleration globally of national policies to drive decarbonisation,” he said. “It’s patchy but it’s accelerating. We’re also seeing the majority of the world’s largest emitting companies commit themselves to net zero by 2050, and also commit to lobby for action that is consistent with limiting warming to 1.5 degrees.”

Mr Jackson said many of the companies captured by the safeguard mechanism had for years been stress-testing their businesses to withstand carbon prices in the order of $100 per tonne.

“They’ve been telling the market and telling investors that it’s not a material concern.”

He said the direct cost of the safeguard mechanism changes would be far lower than a direct carbon price.

Emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries covered by the safeguard – a policy introduced by the former Coalition government in 2016 – account for 78 per cent of the total emissions covered by the scheme and 56 per cent of facilities.

According to Reputex, which modelled Labor’s pre-election climate change plan, the safeguard currently provides assistance to industries dominated by aluminium, iron and steel, petroleum refining, LNG production, and cement.

“Given their contribution to covered emissions, the loosening of constraints for these industries (such as slower baseline decline rates) could undermine Australia’s low-carbon transition, while placing a heavier burden on domestic, non-trade exposed industries, such as domestic airlines and domestic gas, which are themselves ‘hard to abate’,” Reputex said in its submission."

These dangers infect wellbeing, health, and functioning of the occupants of the structure, including hospitals, clinics, businesses, office buildings, and schools. AeroClean has an answer.

“Indoor air quality (IAQ) is in focus because of this realization that there can be airborne threats that not only are not healthy, and people can get sick, and even die, but it also threatens everyone's way of life.” Jason DiBona, CEO of AeroClean Technologies tells Infection Control Today® (ICT®) in an exclusive interview. “[It is] something that can be transmitted in the air, whether you're at home or in your offices, or anywhere where you share indoor air. When you think about air quality, specifically indoor air quality, is becoming even more important.”

Video Highlights Beginning: introduction of Jason DiBona and Aeroclean Technologies 1:21 Why is indoor air quality so important in medical facilities? 6:48 Will you explain Pūrgo? What is it, how did it come about, and why is It important? Picture of Pūrgo at 7:00 or so. 13:00 Independent testing, especially with UV-C is important and shows which companies are to be trusted.

What does that mean? 22:42 How is the Pūrgo is improving indoor air quality in the spaces it's currently installed? 30:26 Is there any further testing expected? 33:42 Do you have anything else to add?

DiBona explains “In the United States alone, somewhere in the range of 2 million hospital acquired infections happened. There are health care associated infections, not just in hospitals, but in the health care span. Somewhere around 100,000 people who get those infections die on an annual basis. Some portion of that can be attributed to airborne or aerosolized pathogens. So indoor air quality, specifically, infectious airborne control in medical facilities, has life-changing consequences.”

Within a hospital, hospital rooms, operating rooms, and other acute care rooms must be filtrated with a HEPA filter, but as DiBona mentions, other areas are at risk too, like waiting rooms and elevators.

When you're cooking or cleaning inside your home, what chemicals are you breathing, and are they potentially harmful? Colorado State University chemists have given us a solid start on the answer.

A large, collaborative research experiment that attempted to map the airborne chemistry of a typical home took place in 2018 and was co-led by Delphine Farmer, associate professor in the Department of Chemistry at CSU. The experiment, called HOMEChem, brought 60 scientists from 13 universities to a test house at the University of Texas at Austin to perform typical home activities like cooking and cleaning and to use sophisticated instrumentation to document the chemistry that resulted.

In a new paper in Environmental Science & Technology, Farmer's team at CSU has taken the massive amounts of data collected during HOMEChem and sorted it out by health effects. They identified how many compounds they observed that are known human toxins, or, based on newer Environmental Protection Agency models, predicted to be likely human toxins. Most such compounds are emitted in low quantities and can be cleared through proper ventilation. But the health impacts of both the individual compounds and their complex mixtures indoors are not well understood by scientists.

The bottom line? ""Indoor air isn't going to kill you, but we do find that indoor air has many more—and often times at higher levels—known and potential air toxics versus outdoors, particularly when you're cooking,"" said Farmer, an atmospheric chemist who, before this experiment, had spent the majority of her career measuring more ""traditional,"" outdoor air toxics.

Data management

The feat of data management for meaningfully connecting the data from HOMEChem to toxins databases was led by co-author Anna Hodshire, a former CSU postdoctoral researcher with skill in analyzing data from atmospheric instrumentation.

""I think it's very interesting that there are so many compounds emitted from common household activities, and that the majority of these compounds have not been studied from a toxicity perspective,"" Hodshire said. ""This doesn't automatically mean that all of these compounds are toxic—but it does point to the fact that a lot more work needs to be done to assess some of the compounds that are emitted frequently in high concentrations from household activities.""

From the vast array of compounds measured during HOMEChem, there emerged the usual suspects, like benzene and formaldehyde, in varying quantities. The lesser-known acrolein, which is a pulmonary toxicant emitted by lumber and heating of fats, came to light as a potential compound of interest for further investigation, Farmer said. Another compound that emerged from Hodshire's analysis was isocyanic acid, which is not well studied and is known to react with proteins in the human body.

The researchers found that cooking activities produced larger amounts of potentially toxic compounds, similar to some seen in wildfire smoke—which made sense to Farmer, when you think of a wildfire as just an ""extreme form of cooking.""

Gaps in understanding of everyday toxins

Contributing to the body of knowledge around indoor air chemistry through the HOMEChem experiment has given Farmer and her team a newfound appreciation of just how much is missing of our understanding of our everyday exposures to potential toxins.

""We have done our part now, and hopefully there's enough information for others to pick up the charge and see what compounds are important to study,"" Farmer said.

Farmer and collaborator Marina Vance from the University of Colorado Boulder led a follow-up experiment to HOMEChem in 2022 called CASA, which delved further into how chemicals emitted indoors react with surfaces such as floors, walls and furniture. Results from that experiment are forthcoming.

Coral reefs can adapt to climate change if given the chance to evolve, according to a study led by Coral Reef Alliance, Rutgers University, the University of Washington and other institutions.

The recent study, published in Nature Ecology and Evolution, finds that coral reefs can evolve and adapt to the effects of climate change—but only if we protect a sufficient diversity of coral reefs, particularly when it comes to temperatures.

""Evolution happens when corals that have already adapted to new environmental conditions breed with corals that have not yet adapted,"" said Malin Pinsky, associate professor at Rutgers and a coauthor of the study. ""As ocean temperatures rise, we need to keep corals in hotter waters healthy and protected so they can reproduce and spread their heat tolerance to other coral reef areas.""

The study advocates for a conservation approach that protects coral reefs at local, regional and global scales, in a way that allows heat tolerance to spread.

The authors of the study said if humanity takes rapid and effective action to keep coral reefs healthy at local scales and addresses climate change, coral reef ecosystems may recover over the next century and thrive in the future.

""The best part about these results are that they underscore the importance of our actions at local scales—we don't have to just sit back and watch coral reefs suffer as our climate changes,"" said Madhavi Colton, lead author of the study and former executive director of the Coral Reef Alliance. ""This study provides guidance on how to design local conservation solutions that will have real, lasting impacts well into the future.""

Coral reefs cover less than 1% of the Earth's surface, but they are one of the most biodiverse ecosystems on our planet. Home to about 25% of all marine life, coral reefs support an estimated one billion people with food, income and coastal protection. But threats to coral reefs continue to mount. Today, nearly 75% of all coral reefs are threatened by climate change and localized human activities.

Scientists predict 99% of coral reefs will be lost by the end of this century without concerted efforts to protect them.

""We simply cannot afford to lose coral reefs,"" said Helen Fox, conservation science director at the Coral Reef Alliance and a collaborating author on the study. ""It is imperative that we do what we can to save coral reefs now because we will be faced with combined global economic, humanitarian, and biodiversity crises if we do not.""

cdc79235-aa84-4470-bf1d-a556f10f6d86,"Yvon Chouinard’s bold donation of his $3bn company for the public good (Yvon Chouinard – the ‘existential dirtbag’ who founded and gifted Patagonia, 15 September) felt like oxygen to all of us working to ensure a livable planet for the future – and raised questions about which moneyed leaders might follow. But how should such investments be made in humanity’s and the planet’s future?

As I and my colleagues argued in the World Scientists’ Warnings series of papers and action framework, our planetary and societal crises are just symptoms of overshoot, with relatively simple root-cause solutions: stabilising and reducing human numbers and appetites. Climate change, road rage, water insecurity and plastics pollution aren’t independent crises – we shouldn’t be fighting them as if they are.

Capitalism may incentivise scattershot approaches, but bold, unifying steps are needed in the vanishing time available. Five unifying global actions on biodiversity and climate change should shape environmental investments:

Stringent global ecosystem protection – especially carbon-rich systems, a very rapid end to logging, and strict proforestation (mature forest protection).

Rapid global ecosystem restoration, especially in areas shifting from carbon sinks to carbon sources like forests, savannahs and wetlands.

Rapid and equitability-focused post-growth economics. Our appetites and numbers overwhelm virtually every action taken for the good of people and planet.

Focused climate restoration – accelerated nature-based technology to remove greenhouse gases from our atmosphere – can buy time to transition our economy, politics and mindsets to a post-carbon future and a habitable planet for our children.

Explicit intergenerational and fair-start rights – such as those of Wales and other wellbeing economy governments – will require future generations’ and other species’ rights to be taken into account.

Patagonia’s actions are a powerful step to kickstart the transition of our broken civilisation and economy to a wiser, kinder, more sustainable future. Literally everything that we know and love is at stake.

Our planet is 1.2°C (2.2°F) hotter today than in 1908, when Henry Ford debuted the world’s first mass-market automobile. Without a dramatic course correction, there is a 50-50 chance of planetary warming surpassing 1.5°C (2.7°F) in the next five years. If we reach that point, 90 percent of coral reefs could die off, extreme heat waves will become nine times more common, and sea levels will rise several feet. Historically, the conversation around climate solutions has focused on decarbonization—reducing fossil fuel use and investing in renewables. Though this is critical, it is not sufficient. Even if we transition to 100 percent clean energy, temperatures will continue to rise unless we also address our unsustainable relationship with nature.

Earth’s forests, grasslands and marshes are natural climate regulators, thanks to the silent miracle of photosynthesis. But when we degrade that land—through deforestation, over-grazing and over-farming—we release the carbon stored in those ecosystems, while reducing their capacity to store future emissions. Already, we have converted 50 percent of all nature to agricultural land, cities, and roads. This is deeply concerning, as intact nature absorbs 25 percent of our carbon emissions from fossil fuel use—that number is falling every year as nature is further degraded. Unsustainable land use and agriculture is the source of approximately one-quarter of all greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. Human-managed lands could be a powerful tool for mitigating the climate crisis; instead, they are accelerating it.

This month, scientists from Conservation International and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research released the Exponential Roadmap for Natural Climate Solutions, a first-of-its-kind blueprint for maximizing nature’s climate-stabilizing potential. In this report, we propose a new guiding principle known as the Carbon Law for Nature: To limit planetary warming and keep 1.50C within sight, we must reach net-zero land-sector emissions by 2030, then reach 10 billion tons of annual negative emissions by 2050. No doubt, this is an ambitious target, but we have a realistic plan for achieving it. Our plan does not call for unproven technologies or science-fiction geoengineering projects. Instead, it relies on a toolkit of proven conservation measures, many of which are centuries-old and can be rapidly scaled.

First, protect the carbon-rich ecosystems that remain intact, prioritizing “irrecoverable” places that cannot regrow—e.g., the Amazon rainforest and the Congo Basin peatlands—within our lifetimes.

Second, restore high-carbon ecosystems that have already been lost, particularly coastal mangrove forests, peatlands, and rainforests.

Third, we must fix how we manage working lands: farmland, timberland and grazing lands. Roughly 80 percent land-based emissions reductions are contingent on transforming the global food system, the largest driver of deforestation and a major driver of emissions. This transformation must be both top-down and bottom-up—nearly everyone has a role to play. Large corporations must re-examine their supply chains, while financial institutions shift capital away from companies that degrade and destroy and towards those that regenerate and restore. At the same time, governments must use economic incentives to reward good behavior and discourage bad; this includes redirecting subsidies away from heavy industry, investing in climate-smart agriculture and grazing, and passing import restrictions on unsustainable commodities.

At the grassroots level, modest changes by landowners and managers can have enormous aggregate effects. Farmers, for example, can do their part—and improve livelihoods at the same time—by integrating trees into cropland, using fertilizers more efficiently and adopting low-till soil management. If just 20 percent of global forests, farms and pastures switched to greener practices, the climate impact would be akin to removing 1.7 billion automobiles from the road. Notably, many climate-smart agriculture practices do not reduce crop yields—in many cases, they can bolster production by increasing resilience against heat waves and drought.

If all three components of this plan—protection, management, and restoration—are adopted in earnest, they will not only help fight climate change; they will also protect wildlife, reduce disease spillover, promote food and water security and grow rural economies. This is the true potential of bold climate action: A world that is more prosperous, more equitable, and more abundant.

The human race is wildly destructive, causing enormous damage to the environment around us. According to the European Commission, mankind is estimated to be responsible for approximately 15 per cent of the current excessive warming of global temperatures. And according to the organization Client Earth, “an increase in average global temperatures above 1.5C risks sea level rise, extreme weather and the loss of species and habitats as well as food scarcity and increasing poverty for millions of people worldwide.”

Pollutants in the air break down the Ozone Layer, which is supposed to protect us from harmful rays infiltrating the upper atmospheres. With a damaged Ozone Layer, the polar ice caps are heating up and satellite images show that major ice floes are melting at a dangerously rapid rate. The polar ice caps, being white, reflect sunlight — and heat — back into space. Without this incredible help from nature, the sunlight is instead getting absorbed, thereby heating the atmosphere.

US President Joe Biden has appointed former Secretary of State John Kerry as his climate czar with the mission to tackle climate change and develop ways to solve some of the problems contributing to this ever-worsening catastrophe. Some experts believe one of the ways to tackle the problem of climate change is through Machine Learning (ML) which “can be a powerful tool in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and helping society adapt to a changing climate.”

These experts explain that the effects of climate change are “increasingly visible” through storms, droughts, fires, and flooding, which have “become stronger and more frequent.” They cite the 2018 intergovernmental report on climate change, which estimated that the world “will face catastrophic consequences unless global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are eliminated within 30 years. Yet year after year, these emissions rise.”

They add that addressing climate change “involves mitigation (reducing emissions) and adaptation (preparing for unavoidable consequences).” These two approaches are crucial for understanding and solving the issues related to climate change. Mitigating the causes of climate change is the first important step toward reducing our massive carbon footprint.

Renewable energy is the first solution that comes to mind of course, but it isn’t as simple as it sounds. Wind farms take up space on land, are known to injure and kill birds, and are only useful when it is windy. Solar farms take up huge tracts of land and are only useful when it is sunny. Electric Vehicles (EV) are becoming more popular, but their energy still comes from electricity which is generated by carbon-producing power plants. The state of California recently announced a policy to ban the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035. Some popular suggestions in recent years include keeping fossil fuels in the ground, investing in renewable energy, and switching to sustainable transport.

It is clear that there is no one solution that will fix climate change. There must be a combined effort on the part of individuals, businesses and governments, which, in time, can potentially reduce the damage being done. Not everyone needs to do what Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard did, which is give away his entire apparel company worth $3 billion for the climate change cause.

There is no shortage of climate-change-thumping activists who preach to the public and then callously turn around to climb aboard their carbon-emissions-producing private jets. And even if the United States government implements strict laws and regulations regarding factory emissions, it will have no effect on the mind-blowing pollution produced by factories in China and India.

Greenpeace notes that in 2015, world leaders signed the Paris agreement, to put climate change solutions into practice. “Core to all climate change solutions is reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which must get to zero as soon as possible. Because both forests and oceans play vitally important roles in regulating our climate, increasing the natural ability of forests and oceans to absorb carbon dioxide can also help stop global warming.”

Greenpeace also notes that “major oil and gas companies including BP, Exxon and Shell have spent hundreds of millions of pounds trying to delay or stop government policies that would have helped tackle the climate crisis.”

Preventing lobbyists from influencing lawmakers and introducing tougher laws and regulations is the only way to ensure true action on the ground. While it is unlikely that India or China will be willing, at least in the immediate future, to make any changes, the US can and should implement its own changes. A next step could be the creation of incentives by western countries including the US and EU, to encourage other countries to follow suit and create a cleaner future for the next generations."

7f921283-a196-45de-8d21-c3cac415d9eb,"Youth groups in Africa are preparing to embark on a series of climate demonstrations on Friday to highlight the problem of “loss and damage” to poor countries blighted by climate breakdown, as only one rich country has so far stepped up with funding for the problem.

Actions will take place on Friday in Ghana, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Togo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with more to follow in some other African nations over the weekend.

Denmark became the first central government of a developed country to propose funding devoted to “loss and damage” – which refers to those ravages of climate-related disasters which are so extreme that no protection against them is possible.

At the UN general assembly, for which world leaders are converging on New York this week, the Danish government announced to philanthropists and poor countries that it would provide DKK 100m (£12m) specifically for loss and damage.

Scotland has also offered funds for loss and damage, pledging £2m at the Cop26 UN climate summit in Glasgow last November, and the government of the Belgian region of Wallonia pledged €1m (£0.9m) towards administration. Denmark is the first central or federal government to make a dedicated pledge.

The sums are tiny compared with the tens or hundreds of billions of dollars of losses that countries are expected to experience, but the symbolism is important. At Cop26, governments agreed to forge a framework to address loss and damage, but there was no agreement on a funding mechanism.

Carolina Cecilio, of the climate thinktank E3G, said: “Denmark’s announcement is good news. It sends the right political signal and could incentivise other countries to follow. [It] is a step in the right direction, and further adds to the momentum on loss and damage. Now we just need more countries to follow with finance commitments, and be serious about supporting the people in need.”

There are still question marks over how the Danish finance would work, and some campaigners and experts are concerned that some of it appears earmarked for insurance schemes rather than representing direct aid.

Matthew Samuda, a minister in Jamaica’s ministry of economic growth, said: “Jamaica is happy to see a developed nation stepping up to the plate and acknowledging the absolute need for loss and damage to be acknowledged. It is our hope that this will pave the way for commitments from other developed nations. Though $13m will not cover the vast devastation we are already experiencing from climatic events, I wish to thank Denmark for getting the ball rolling.”

No other developed countries have indicated they are likely to follow the Danish lead. G7 governments may be more inclined to provide finance to the “global shield” initiative backed by Germany, as president of the G7 this year.

The global shield is intended to provide funds for poor countries to gain resilience against the damages of extreme weather, for instance through providing the finance needed for developing countries to fulfil their “preparedness plans”, and could also involve a system of insurance against climate-related disasters.

The loose definitions of the global shield mean that future funding related to the initiative could also be tagged as “loss and damage” funding, noted Cecilio.

Even if no other countries step up at the UN general assembly, they will face increasing pressure in all climate forums to address loss and damage. The youth protests scheduled for this Friday, as world leaders fly home from New York, are the prelude to a sustained push on the issue.

Developing countries were unsatisfied by the meagre attention paid to loss and damage at Cop26, where the focus was on rich-country pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

They see their next big chance at the Cop27 UN climate conference, in Egypt in November. “Cop27 must act decisively on loss and damage to reinforce the collective commitment to leaving no one behind,” said Yamide Dagnet, director of climate justice at the Open Society Foundations.

She pointed to the floods in Pakistan as an example of loss and damage that rich countries need to address. “In a single day, a third of Pakistan was inundated and more people than Canada’s entire population were affected. When you wipe out an entire agricultural area, you set back already vulnerable people by decades.”

With an eye to the Cop27 discussions, a group of island governments have formed a new initiative, called Rising Nations, launched at UNGA on Wednesday, to prepare for the worst. Tuvalu, Kiribati and the Marshall Islands called for “a global settlement that guarantees their nation states a permanent existence beyond the inhabitable lifetimes of their atolls”.

At Cop27, countries will be asked to consider new global taxes as a way of funding loss and damage payments. António Guterres, UN secretary-general, called at the UN general assembly for a windfall tax on oil and gas companies to provide the cash needed. A leaked discussion paper, seen by the Guardian, prepared by developing countries, also raised the possibility of a global tax, on carbon emissions or air travel, to provide the funds needed.

An alternative is for existing development institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to corral money from donor nations.

The vital issue must be to ensure a flow of cash to where it is needed, according to Carlos Fuller, Belize’s representative to the UN. “Loss and damage is already occurring in Belize,” he said. “Severe erosion is altering communities, drought and floods affecting farmers and causing infrastructure damage, coral bleaching, and salt water intrusion is affecting the water supply. These impacts undermine our people’s quality of life and the lifeblood of our economy. A financial mechanism for loss and damage must be established at Cop27 to provide support to the communities that did little to cause this crisis.”"

Sept 20 (Reuters) - Denmark on Tuesday pledged over $13 million (100 million Danish crowns) to support developing nations that have experienced losses caused by climate disruptions, becoming the first country to offer ""loss and damage"" compensation to the most climate-vulnerable areas.

Danish Development Minister Flemming Møller Mortensen made the pledge on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, saying the new climate funds would go to the Sahel region in northwestern Africa and other fragile regions.

""I am very happy that we have agreed to increase support for climate-related losses and damages,"" he said in a statement. ""It is grossly unfair that the world's poorest should suffer the most from the consequences of climate change, to which they have contributed the least.""

Some of the world's most fragile areas, such as low-lying islands are pushing to create a funding facility for ""loss and damage"" - or consequences of climate change that go beyond what people can adapt to - to be established at U.N. climate negotiations in Egypt in November.

The United States, EU and other rich nations that represent the bulk of historical greenhouse gas emissions have opposed the creation of a separate fund to address loss and damage.

At the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow last year, Scottish leader Nicola Sturgeon announced a symbolic 1 million pound loss and damage investment as a way to encourage industrialized countries to follow suit.

Denmark offered the new loss and damage funding as part of its 2022 Finance Act and pledge to dedicate at least 60% of its climate aid to help countries adapt to climate change.

c64ab52a-e9a3-4606-8329-0c1796a915a7,"Denmark has broken the ice on a difficult issue in debates over global warming. Yesterday it announced it will start giving money to countries that feel the worst effects of climate change and yet are the least responsible for it. The decision by one of the world’s most industrialized nations could set a precedent for similar countries in acknowledging how their historic use of fossil fuels requires them to lift up less-developed nations.

Copenhagen’s initial pledge is modest – $13 million. That’s compared to an estimated $70 billion needed annually by developing countries for adaptation to climate change. But the recognition of responsibility signals potentially larger funding to help such countries become resilient to adverse weather events, especially if the money is directed toward clean governance and local support.

Danish Development Minister Flemming Møller Mortensen said the move would have a healing effect on “negotiations between rich and poor countries, where the debate about loss and damage for far too long has been full of conflict.”

Since 2013, every United Nations climate summit has officially recognized the need for “loss and damage” compensation. The idea is that wealthier nations should help offset the long-term effects of their carbon emissions. The effects range from damage to homes to damage to ecosystems and culture.

Putting a number on such compensation has been difficult. A lawsuit in Peru shows why wealthier nations have resisted giving climate aid. A local farmer is suing an energy producer in Germany over the possibility that its emissions helped melt glaciers that resulted in the flooding of his village. Where, richer countries ask, are the boundaries of liability?

Earlier this year, a group of 48 developing countries calling itself the V20 group of vulnerable nations sought to address that concern. It established a fund to both share the burden of climate costs and show that such funding can be fairly and transparently used.

Taking responsibility for the adverse impact of emissions has gained some ground. Scotland and a region in Brussels made modest “loss and damages” pledges at last year’s climate summit in Glasgow. At the U.N. this week, 16 countries, including Germany, agreed to support biodiversity – which helps mitigate climate change and its effects.

“Only through dialogue, cooperation, and sharing of ideas, information, and experiences, we will be able to advance concrete initiatives that can help people, communities, and countries at risk,” wrote A.K. Abdul Momen, Bangladeshi foreign minister; Mr. Mortensen; and Birgitte Qvist-Sørensen, general secretary at DanChurchAid, in Climate Home News. “Our goal is to turn dead-end discussions into cooperation and action helping us all to manage climate induced loss and damage.”

The country pledged 100 million Danish crowns—more than $13 million—that will go to the Sahel region in northwestern Africa and other impacted regions, per Reuters’ Valerie Volcovici.

“It is grossly unfair that the world’s poorest should suffer the most from the consequences of climate change, to which they have contributed the least,"" Danish development minister Flemming Møller Mortensen says in a statement. “With this new agreement, we are putting action behind words.”

Wealthier nations are responsible for much of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. Of all historical carbon dioxide emissions, 23 developed nations—including the U.S. and many E.U. countries—are responsible for half. More than 150 nations’ emissions make up the rest. Between 1990 and 2015, the richest 1 percent of the world contributed twice as much carbon pollution as the poorest half of the world did, per a 2020 OXFAM report. Yet developing nations bear the brunt of the impacts and often don’t have the funds to adapt to the changing climate.

Bhutan, a small country in the Himalayas, is carbon negative, absorbing more carbon dioxide than it emits. But it faces melting glaciers, flash floods and mudslides, reported the New York Times’ Nadja Popovich and Brad Plumer last year.

“We have contributed the least to this problem, yet we suffer disproportionately,” Sonam P. Wangdi, chair of the Least Developed Countries group under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, told the Times. “There must be increasing support for adapting to impacts.”

Climate justice advocates have long pushed for loss and damage pay, but the idea has recently garnered more attention as climate disasters, such as the flooding in Pakistan and the drought in East Africa, take their toll, per the Washington Post’s Sarah Kaplan.

More than 400 advocacy organizations have signed a letter demanding loss and damage finance be added to the agenda for the COP27 Climate Conference, which will take place in November in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. At COP26 last year, both Scotland and the Wallonia region of Belgium, which are not U.N. member states, pledged money for loss and damage and urged other nations to follow suit.

Some experts, however, have expressed concern about a portion of the Danish funding going to an insurance program rather than to direct aid, writes the Guardian’s Fiona Harvey. Such a system would “create business for European corporations in the developing countries, eventually making vulnerable people pay for the premium toward losses and damages from climate disasters,” Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy at the nonprofit Climate Action Network, tells the Post.

Still, activists tell the Guardian that Denmark’s investment is a significant step that might encourage other countries to make similar pledges.

“[We] deserve to live without the looming fear of debt and destruction,” Walton Webson, Antigua and Barbuda’s ambassador to the U.N. and chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, tells the Guardian. “Our islands are bearing the heaviest burden of a crisis we did not cause, and the urgent establishment of a dedicated loss and damage response fund is key to sustainable recovery. We are experiencing climate impacts that become more and more extreme with each passing year.”"

Mortensen said the funds would go to Africa’s Sahel region and other vulnerable areas affected by the climate crisis.

“With this new agreement, we are putting action behind words,” he added.

Last year at the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow (COP26), the G77, a bloc of more than 130 developing countries, demanded financial support for climate victims, but the initiative was blocked by the US, the European Union, and other rich countries.

Addressing the “loss and damage” in vulnerable countries was already agreed on under the Paris Agreement, but due to the fear of being sued by those countries affected by climate disasters, it was then rejected by the rich nations.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stressed that the rich nations should support countries suffering losses and damage caused by the climate crisis by imposing taxes on windfall profits of fossil fuel companies.

Efficiency and clean fuels won’t be enough. Governments and industry must experiment with other approaches to bring the climate impact of aviation close to zero.

Aviation is a big polluter. Globally, the industry generates roughly one billion tonnes of carbon dioxide per year — comparable to that produced by Japan, the world’s third-largest economy. Although many governments are regulating emissions from cars and trucks, such as by phasing out internal-combustion engines and switching to electric vehicles, air transportation is technologically rooted in old patterns. Apart from a pause during the COVID-19 pandemic, emissions from flights have risen by 2.5% each year for the past two decades. Over the next 30 years, the industry’s impact on global warming is set to exceed that of its whole history1, since the Wright brothers’ first flights in the early 1900s.

Cutting the sector’s impact on global warming is high on the agenda of the triennial assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in Montreal, Canada, this month. Ministers from 193 nations will try to negotiate an industry-wide target for cutting emissions, in line with the goals of the Paris climate agreement. There will be much talk about the need for action. However, the preparations indicate that most of the focus will be on familiar ideas, such as cleaner forms of jet fuel and schemes to offset carbon emissions. It is no coincidence that these ideas are also the least disruptive to how the industry operates today.

We commercialized a methane capture technology in ten years — here’s how

In our view, this approach could prove dangerously narrow. Eliminating aviation’s impact on global warming means upending the industry. The longer that reality is evaded, the harder it will be to find effective solutions.

Emissions from aircraft cannot be slashed simply by bolting on new kit to capture pollution. It might prove impossible to produce clean enough forms of jet fuel at sufficient scale. The leading forms of carbon offsetting are so flawed as to be unworkable. And addressing the other climate impacts of aircraft beyond CO 2 , such as contrails, might require overhauling engines, airframes and on-board storage, in an industry that is extremely attentive to safety, weight and space. A typical airliner contains several million components. Commercial aviation is also tightly interwoven with air-traffic control and ground-handling processes, which make profound changes hard to plan and implement.

Experimentation is what is needed. Airlines, fuel providers and aircraft and engine manufacturers should test a wide range of ideas to learn what might really work. Some of this research is under way, but governments and companies need to push faster and harder. Getting started will also require understanding how uncertainties in climate science and technology affect emission control strategies.

Limited vision

The aviation industry’s response to the climate challenge is a triumph of industrial interests over reality. The reasons are easy to understand. Airlines often operate on razor-thin margins. Airports struggle to recover the cost of large investments in infrastructure, with the risks of stranded costs when technology changes rapidly. And aircraft manufacturers ‘bet the company’ each time they design a wholly new plane, such as Boeing’s 787 or the Airbus A380. Major segments of the aviation industry are led by big firms, which are sensitive to risk and cost. They want the least disruptive technological options. The intergovernmental association ICAO reflects what governments and firms are willing to do today.

An analysis of ways to decarbonize conference travel after COVID-19

There is a disconnect, however, between aims and what will actually be needed. Aviation companies and industry organizations have made bold pronouncements. Many have committed to net zero CO 2 pollution by 2050. Yet nobody knows how to make such deep cuts. Road maps have been outlined for technologies such as ‘sustainable aviation fuels’ by international bodies (including ICAO), by industrial partnerships such as Mission Possible and by governments such as the United Kingdom. At best, these plans are a first draft.

The aviation industry’s response to climate change centres almost entirely on two options: cleaner fuels and carbon offsetting.

Today, most sustainable aviation fuels come from biofuel feedstocks such as vegetable oils and used cooking oils. As with biofuels for cars, such fuels are designed to be compatible with existing jet engines and are produced through well-known agricultural and industrial methods. Today, there is barely any demand, so it is easy to supply — just 0.05% of all jet fuel meets the classification for sustainable aviation fuels, even in Europe, which is leading this shift.

But looking farther ahead, there is a risk that such fuels cannot be produced sustainably in sufficient volumes and at low enough prices to replace all jet fuel2. Scaling up will require other ways of producing it, such as from genetically engineered algae or other biological feedstocks that are cleaner to produce and less reliant on land. Jet-fuel molecules might even be assembled by machines that scrub CO 2 from the air. Such technologies, some quite promising, are at early stages.

Fuel efficiency will play a part, but is unlikely to reduce emissions radically. Already, the industry has economic incentives to squeeze more passenger-kilometres of service out of each tonne of costly jet fuel, but improvement rates are unlikely to be much greater than 1% per year3. Shifting demand away from aircraft can contribute, too, if short-haul flights are replaced by electric high-speed trains and if business trips (and perhaps some leisure) switch to videoconferencing4. But the big driver for aviation is long-distance travel, for which speedy aircraft are unrivalled. When people get richer, they want to move around.

Facing the reality that the sector will keep emitting a lot, ICAO has established an international carbon-trading scheme — Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, or CORSIA. This encourages extensive use of offsets5: aviation companies can buy emissions credits or invest in sectors that store carbon, such as forestry, to allow them to carry on as normal. CORSIA aims to keep CO 2 emissions at 2019 levels through such purchases for emissions over that year’s baseline. ICAO foresees that cumulative demand might reach 1.7 billion tonnes by 2035, potentially making aviation the largest offset market in the world (see go.nature.com/3rwjtss).

Fuel crisis: slash demand in three sectors to protect economies and climate

Yet offsetting faces a fundamental challenge: the size of the offset requires estimating flows of warming pollution that would have occurred if the carbon-removal project hadn’t existed, and comparing them against flows with the project in place. The former — a baseline that is unobservable — is a cauldron for shady accounting and other gremlins.

The vast majority of offsets today and in the expected future come from forest-protection and regrowth projects. The track record of reliable accounting in these industries is poor, because they lack robust baselines. Even with oversight, forest projects are often plagued by wild assumptions, for example that trees would disappear completely from these areas in the absence of those projects, even when there are other forest protections in place. Such assumptions drive up baselines and flood the market with huge volumes of offsets6. They make it easier for accountants to claim a net reduction in emissions even though the atmosphere sees little or no benefit. These problems are essentially unfixable7. Evidence is mounting that offsetting as a strategy for reaching net zero is a dead end.

Big unknowns

And there’s another reason carbon offset and cleaner fuels fall short. They do not address all the ways in which the aviation industry affects climate, many of which remain uncertain. We know that aircraft engines burn fossil fuels, releasing CO 2 , a warming gas. But high temperatures in engines also produce nitrogen oxides, and they release aerosols that alter the composition of the atmosphere. Burning hydrocarbons generates water vapour that, by mingling with aerosols, produces contrails.

The biggest wild card concerns cloud formation — a fast-evolving aspect marked by huge uncertainties. Some simulations warn that ‘contrail cirrus’ might have caused almost twice as much warming as CO 2 from the aviation sector up to 20188 (see ‘Current warming and cooling effects of aviation’). Other satellite-based studies suggest a much lower figure9. Because of these additional effects, even if biofuels replace conventional jet fuel and reduce CO 2 emissions, they might not fully fix the climate.

Source: Ref. 8

That leads to a second profound uncertainty: investment planning. How can governments and industry try to cure the patient when the diagnosis is unclear? If contrail cirrus proves to be a major problem, then solutions will need to go well beyond clean fuels — to different propulsion systems and even rerouting aircraft. Contrail cirrus forms only under some atmospheric conditions, so, in principle, adjustments to flight schedules, altitudes and routes could have a role. If carbon offsets won’t actually offset at scale, or if clean fuels do not scale up, then the aviation industry must do more on its own to cut climate impacts.

Doing better, faster

Three steps can help to lead the aviation industry in a different direction.

First, the industry and governments must become more self-aware of the risks associated with its current approach to the climate crisis, which reflects self-interest in preserving the status quo. Sustainable aviation fuels might have a big role, but a lot more investment is needed into options that are far from viable today, such as electric- or hydrogen-powered aircraft, that could prove to be effective strategies for reducing contrails and eliminating emissions. Because they are highly disruptive, those solutions are unlikely to spring from the mainstream industry.

The forthcoming ICAO assembly can be a forum for such discussions. Still, massive technological change never comes about through planning by global committees of incumbents. Such committees, prone to avoid disagreements, select options such as carbon offsets that can be even worse than inaction. Instead, ICAO should focus on what it does well, such as setting global goals. It might prove impossible, politically, to shut down CORSIA, but the organization should at least examine the limits to offsets schemes.

Make greenhouse-gas accounting reliable — build interoperable systems

Second, international coalitions of ‘first movers’ in aviation need to be established — small groups of governments and firms that are willing to lead. Seeds for such coalitions exist, with both Boeing and Airbus engaged, along with some governments and airlines, freight haulers and companies that spend a lot on business travel. So far, however, these nascent efforts are too narrowly focused on fuel replacements.

A more diverse experimental approach is needed — investing in varied response strategies, including hydrogen, electricity and cleaner, more scalable variants of fuels. It would probably have Europe at the centre, because its climate policies are already strong and credible and European governments can help to back technologically and financially risky investments. Focal points include an effort by the European air-traffic management system to understand which routes would be better for the climate, because shorter routes with fewer delays can lower the demand for fuel and new routes can reduce contrail formation. Similar initiatives around the world to experiment with flight diversions could be boosted over climate concerns. Recent US climate and infrastructure legislation includes big spending on hydrogen that could also be a hub for clean aviation. Stronger regulatory incentives could increase pressure for change.

Norway’s commitment to create a market for short-haul electric aircraft is a good example of a joint programme between government and business that is designed to invest in disruptive technology. In a small country riven by fjords and mountains, many Norwegian airports are designed for short take-offs and landings and have small distances between them. Norway is thus a good test bed for electric aircraft and, because few of these routes are commercially viable, the government can set the terms of tenders to require zero-emission flights. This market is inspiring a supply of small electric aircraft that could be a niche for refining such technologies.

Similar models of bold exploration have proved successful in the past. For example, when developing the Montreal Protocol on the ozone layer, international goals and public scrutiny — as in aviation today — put pressure on some highly motivated firms and governments to look for solutions to eliminate ozone-depleting substances. They found many. To whittle them down quickly, they set up a joint process managed by government and industry experts to identify the best and most-realistic solutions10. Aviation needs a similar peer-review mechanism, probably outside the conflict-averse ICAO, to scrutinize detailed lessons as they are learnt.

Third, research is essential, for example to bring knowledge about contrails and chemical interactions in the atmosphere to a level at which the aviation industry can be more confident about the route forwards. Theory and measurement of how aviation induces contrail cirrus and other induced cloud changes needs improving, as does understanding of how different propulsion systems affect the climate through atmospheric chemistry. Hydrogen-fuelled aircraft, for example, might leak H 2 gas into the atmosphere during manufacture and transport and still produce nitrogen oxides and contrails, with unknown climate impacts.

Researchers also need to address practical solutions technologically, economically and politically. For example, some might evaluate frontier ideas around induced clouds, alongside strategies such as aircraft rerouting, reformulation of jet fuels and deployment of electric or hydrogen systems.

This all sounds complicated. Yet it is exactly how technological revolutions have occurred in many industries, including the government–industry partnerships that created the age of jet aircraft10,11. It is also how other high-polluting industries are responding to the climate crisis — for example, to decarbonize steel, cement and cars and to redesign nuclear reactors.

Aviation needs to take the uncertainties it faces seriously. ICAO can help, but success will hinge on smaller and local experimentalism."

Aviation's growing impact on the climate crisis requires radical solutions that may upend the industry, according to a new Nature commentary article from the University of California San Diego School of Global Policy and Strategy.

Globally, the industry generates roughly 1 billion tons of CO 2 per year, which is comparable to Japan, the world's third largest economy. Moreover, emissions from flights have been rising by about 2.5% each year. Without bold solutions, the industry is on track to, over the next 30 years, produce more CO 2 than that of its whole history.

While renewable energy has scaled up to replace fossil fuels in power generation and both supply and demand of electric vehicles continues to increase, no carbon-free replacement technologies exist at adequate scale to address pollution from aircraft.

""Most strategies that governments and firms are pursuing today rely on familiar technologies. That approach looks shortsighted because many of these technologies don't work at scale,"" said coauthor David Victor, professor of innovation and public policy at the UC San Diego School of Global Policy and Strategy co-director of the Deep Decarbonization Initiative. ""Eliminating aviation's impact on global warming requires major disruptions to how the industry operates today. The longer that reality is evaded, the harder it will be to find effective solutions.""

The Nature piece comes ahead of assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in Montreal, Canada, from Sept. 27 to Oct. 7, where representatives from 193 nations will try to negotiate an industry-wide target for cutting emissions from the sector.

Victor and coauthor Steffen Kallbekken of the Center for International Climate Research outline why the two most commonly proposed solutions—cleaner fuels and carbon offsetting—that will likely be discussed at the meeting are grossly inadequate.

Carbon offsetting is a reduction or removal of emissions of greenhouse gases (e.g., through land restoration or the planting of trees) that is used to compensate for emissions that occur elsewhere. According to the authors, the track record of reliable accounting in these industries is poor.

""Even with oversight, forest projects are often plagued by wild assumptions, for example that trees would disappear from these areas in the absence of those projects,"" they write.

On the other hand, cleaner aviation fuel, which currently comes from conventional biofuel feedstocks such as vegetable oils, may be impossible to produce sustainably in sufficient volumes and at low enough prices to replace all jet fuel. Achieving the levels of clean fuel adoption that many governments and firms aim for—and doing so sustainably—will require commercializing new production methods and feedstocks that are still technologically in their infancy.

And neither of these solutions are sure to address the climate impacts of contrails, which trap heat radiating from the earth's surface, causing warming in the atmosphere below.

Solutions should be designed to disrupt

In fact, the warming effects of contrails are still poorly understood by climate scientists and therefore given little attention by industry and governments working on decarbonizing aviation. It's possible that the effects are small and could be largely managed by rerouting aircraft around the weather conditions that generate the worst contrails. But the effects could also be massive—up to half the total climate impact of aviation, according to some studies—and require entirely new aviation technologies and approaches to cutting the impact of aviation on the climate.

The study argues that addressing contrails may require profound overhauling of engines, airframes and onboard storage—big, costly and financially risky decisions. The authors urge for more experimentation to test what really could work—backed by government policies and industry collaborations.

""Resistance to efforts disruptive to the industry's status quo are understandable because airlines often operate on razor thin margins,"" Victor added. ""A growing number of airlines want to do something about climate but are stuck with few practical options.""

Victor and Kallbekken recommend three steps for the industry to take to create bold solutions to address a warming planet.

First, the industry and government need to do their homework. They must become more aware of the risks associated with the current approach to aviation's role in the climate crisis.

Second, small collaborations between the most motivated governments and firms could be formed to take risks on new technologies, which could, in turn, inspire others to follow their lead. For example, a partnership between the Norwegian government and businesses is underway to create test bed for electric airplanes.

The authors provide concrete strategies of how other collaborations could be established to potentially ignite other advances. For example, such groups, by sharing costs and risk, could invest in more varied response strategies, including hydrogen, electricity and a cleaner, more scalable version of sustainable aviation fuel. They look to Europe to take the lead since European governments are already highly motivated to take the climate problem seriously.

Finally, the authors underscore how essential research is to better understand contrails and chemical interactions in the atmosphere. It could also provide solutions technologically, economically and politically.

The events we have witnessed these past few years in Malaysia – intense heatwaves, food supply disruptions and devastating floods – may only be the tip of the iceberg. Unless there is collective and immediate action to combat the climate crisis, we can expect to see increasing climatic volatility.

Here are three sobering global facts on the climate transition:

First, to keep the increase in average global surface temperatures to below 2ºC over preindustrial levels as per the Paris Agreement, we need to reduce global emissions. But current global climate policies and country-level efforts to reduce national emissions (“Nationally Determined Contributions”) will still see emissions rise by 2030.

Indeed, analysis by the Climate Action Tracker suggests that we are on track for as much as a 2.7ºC rise in temperatures by 2100.

Second, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that to keep the average temperature rise within the Paris target, we would need to spend an average of US$3 trillion (RM13.6 trillion) globally every year from now to 2050.

Third, if all the cattle in the world – yes, cattle – were to come together and form their own country, this country would be the third largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world, after China and the United States.

So the path forward is challenging. We need to do more – more in terms of stronger, binding pledges; more in terms of mobilising resources; and more in terms of re-evaluating our personal lifestyles. In particular, the low-carbon transition would require changes in the way we create and consume energy, which is responsible for some three-quarters of emissions on a global level. Otherwise, our planet’s fever will not break.

As the writer, Apurva Sanghi, highlights, the IPCC estimates that to keep the average temperature rise within the Paris target, we would need to spend an average of US$3 trillion (RM13.6 trillion) globally every year from now to 2050. — Photo provided

But the required energy transition is not a standalone transition.

It must be accompanied by at least three other transitions summarised as JET: a Just transition, an Economics transition, and a Technology transition.

What will it take for this JET to take-off?

First, the Just transition. This essentially means greening the economy in as equitable and inclusive a way as possible. That sounds straightforward – but is easier said than done.

Last year, the use of renewable energy in the European Union (EU) surpassed that of fossil fuels for the first time in European history. This is a remarkable milestone – for Europe. Biomass, classified as a renewable energy by the EU, played an important role in this achievement.But to meet Europe’s needs, the American South-East emerged as the main supplier of biomass to Europe in the form of wood pellets. Evidence, however, shows that the mass-scale manufacturing of wood pellets causes environmental and health damage to poor, rural communities in the American South-East.

Now imagine if such off-setting was scaled up to poorer countries without the appropriate checks and balances. How “just” would such a transition be? Making sure that those who are left less well-off in the move to become greener are not left behind – beyond country borders – is essential. Because there is no energy transition if there is no just transition.

Second, the Economics transition. Economists have long championed a global carbon tax. But there is little evidence of progress towards one, with one reason being that there is no global government. Even United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) processes to date are voluntary, and based on what individual nations are willing to do to combat climate change.

But even at the country level, carbon taxes have not had the impact economists envisioned. It is telling that the landmark US Inflation Reduction Act (also known as the “Climate Bill”) hardly includes any carbon-based taxes – it mostly introduces subsidies for low-carbon activities.

But then economists have not had a deeper appreciation of non-carbon-tax policies, such as mandating higher fuel efficiency standards in cars. So the economics profession needs to transition too, from its emphasis on complex modelling of “optimal” carbon taxes to more politically feasible and palatable solutions that lead to more direct, green investments.

Now the irony is that countries utilise carbon pricing all the time. For example, fuel excise taxes, a form of carbon tax, have been used since the 1930s. The question therefore is whether to price carbon consciously or unconsciously. The answer is the former – do it consciously.

And this means first addressing fuel subsidies, which are nothing more than a negative price on carbon. Putting a positive price on carbon through a carbon tax, while doing nothing about its negative price, is like putting one foot on the accelerator and the other on the brake at the same time. That car will not move forward.

Finally, the Technology transition. The costs of renewables have decreased significantly in the past two decades. But the issues now have less to do with cost than the barriers to entry faced by renewables in many countries.

Also, most low-carbon technologies such as hydrogen, carbon capture utilisation and storage, and solar reside mostly in the United States, Europe, and China. Spurring their diffusion to the rest of the world will be key in facilitating a global transition.

In terms of technology, the game changer for renewable energy is arguably energy storage – from solid state batteries to pumped hydro and others. Energy storage is thus one area where public and private sector players need to come together to give this technology its moon-shot moment.

If we can smoothly address these three transitions – the Just, Economic and Technology transitions – there is no reason why this JET cannot take off towards a cleaner, greener future.

74b9a52f-f92b-4780-bebf-bb03dece98c2,"In Singapore’s industrial-heavy district of Tuas, Finnish company Neste Oyj is building what will one day be the world’s largest facility for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Once up and running in 2023, the plant should produce 1 million metric tons a year — a decent amount, but still less than 0.3% of annual global jet fuel demand. What little there is will be expensive: SAF costs as much as five times the price of traditional jet fuel, itself coming off a 14-year peak.

That’s a problem for the airline industry, which is counting on SAF as critical component in its efforts to decarbonize. As of now, airlines contribute more than 2% of the world’s carbon emissions and lag almost all other sectors in pledges for a cleaner future."
42656bcd-fba7-419a-b186-11c6440f327e,"A proportional share of the carbon budget for the Safeguard Mechanism facilities would reduce their emissions from 138 million tonnes in 2022-23 to 99 million tonnes in 2030. If the sector spends any more than its total budget over that period of 811 million tonnes, another sector will have to do with less.

The safeguard should be implemented by setting baseline levels of emissions for each facility emitting more than 100,000 tonnes per annum and reducing those baselines in line with the sector decline. The decline rate will deliver emissions in line with the budget. A facility will be able to create or acquit tradable safeguard credits or Australian carbon credit units if its emissions are below or above its baseline, thereby lowering the overall cost.

The government is consulting on a range of design issues, three of which are critical to its success but which are likely to be controversial.

High level of certainty

First, each facility should have a fixed baseline, an absolute annual quantity that declines over time. Fixed baselines create a high level of certainty that the budget will not be exceeded. If the government instead chooses to continue setting baselines based on emissions intensity, it risks blowing the budget. To avoid that, the decline rates would need to be periodically adjusted – a more complex and less transparent approach. Either way, to support investment confidence, all facilities should have a rolling five-year baseline trajectory.

Second, baselines for newly built facilities should be based on industry best practice, and their emissions should be included within the budget. Their inclusion could be accommodated by creating an initial reserve within the budget, followed by annual adjustments to decline rates.

Advertisement

Finally, no facility should be exempt from the costs imposed by the reformed safeguard. Emissions-intensive and trade-exposed industries should be assisted only where the cost will cause the activity to move offshore and lead to an increase in global emissions. Any assistance should be external to the safeguard.

As intended by European countries and possibly the US, Australia could support import-competing activities by introducing a carbon border adjustment mechanism. However, Australia’s economy is more reliant on exports of emissions-intensive commodities. Exporting activities could be supported to decarbonise through the Powering the Regions Fund or the National Reconstruction Fund and/or a reserve of government-funded, low-cost Australian carbon credit units.

This will not be an easy ride. Although industry supports reforming the Safeguard Mechanism, there will be special pleading of the sort that fatally wounded previous Labor attempts to implement effective climate change policy. The difference is that we now have a legislated carbon budget: there can be no exemptions or concessions this time around.

For this government, success will mean that, by the end of its current term, industrial emissions are falling in line with the carbon budget, due to effective actions by companies across the sector. This would be a significant political achievement. More important, it is no exaggeration to suggest there would then be a genuine possibility of bipartisan commitment to policies to drive towards net zero by 2050 and an end to Australia’s climate war."

The Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water has been consulting on the settings of the mechanism, which will require 215 factories and plants that each generate more than 100,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases a year to cut their emissions. Submissions close on Tuesday.

Under the scheme, pollution caps will be introduced from July and tightened over time to deliver about a third of the government’s legislated target of a 43 per cent reduction in emissions from 2005 to 2030.

Affected companies, including coal mines, aluminium smelters, gas exporters and cement producers, will be able to cut their pollution by adopting cleaner technology or buying carbon credits."
d53c4781-c706-4507-99fe-c383782948ad,"Australia’s historic climate law passed the Senate last week and enshrined an economy-wide target to reduce emissions. But an important measure to reduce Australia’s industrial emissions is still up for debate: the “safeguard mechanism”.

Introduced by the Abbott government in 2014, the safeguard mechanism is supposed to stop Australia’s largest greenhouse gas polluters from emitting over a certain threshold. But the policy has been frequently criticised for lacking teeth. The Labor government has promised to strengthen the mechanism, and is currently reviewing it.

Industry has raised concerns over any toughening of the policy. Meanwhile, the Greens will push Labor to strengthen it further.

The safeguard mechanism covers the grid-connected power stations with a sectoral target. It also applies to 215 of Australia’s largest industrial emitters. Together, these 215 facilities produce almost 30% of Australia’s total annual emissions. So a stringent policy to curb this pollution is crucial to climate action.

Wait, what’s the safeguard mechanism?

The safeguard mechanism works by setting a limit on the emissions individual enterprises can produce in a year. This limit is put into place with “baselines” that get set in a number of different ways, depending on the type of company involved. Such companies might include a mining company, aluminium smelter, steelworks or airline.

If the company emits beyond their limit, they can buy carbon credits to compensate for, or “offset”, the excess emissions.

The mechanism covers hard-to-abate industries which are regulated on an individual basis, such as new coal, oil and gas projects, steel, aluminium, manufacturing and transport. These include Woodside’s Northwest Shelf gas project, Qantas, Chevron’s Gorgon gas project, Port Kembla steelworks, and AngloAmerican coal mines in central Queensland.

Coal fired power remains our biggest industrial source of emissions, but is regulated separately. A “sectoral baseline” has been set for all electricity generators connected to the national grid at 198 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalent each year.

Rubbery baseline emissions

Historically, the safeguard mechanism hasn’t put strong obligations on industrial emitters to reduce their emissions. Indeed, industrial emissions have increased since the mechanism began in 2016.

Imposing a genuine carbon limit on high-emitting companies requires a clear definition and enforcement of the baselines. But the safeguard mechanism provides enormous scope for expanded production and, therefore, expanded emissions.

The government’s review paper identifies a major problem with how baselines have been set in the past. Namely, many facilities have been allowed to set their baseline emissions well above their actual emissions.

Read more: 1 in 5 fossil fuel projects overshoot their original estimations for emissions. Why are there such significant errors?

Baselines for each facilities’ emissions are currently measured according to “production-adjusted” emissions intensity. So, for example, a coal mine’s baseline is measured per tonne of coal commodity produced. This means over time, baselines rise or fall in proportion to a company’s expected production.

The government’s consultation paper reports that in the 2020-21 financial year the combined baseline emissions recorded for non-electricity grid emissions under the safeguard mechanism was estimated at 180 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalent.

But actual emissions in the same period were 137 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalent.

It should also be noted that research suggests up to one in five fossil fuel projects are underestimating their actual emissions. But regardless, the high baselines mean there’s no regulatory pressure for companies to reduce their emissions.

The current review paper seeks feedback on these issues. Removing the head room for facilities with baselines well above their actual emissions is on the cards.

Carbon credit questions

The government is poised to propose significantly expanding carbon credit trading under the safeguard mechanism.

Carbon credits are granted to projects that reduce, store or avoid greenhouse gas emissions. These credits can be sold to the federal government or to private companies to offset a project’s own emissions.

Under the current safeguard mechanism, if a company exceeds its baseline emissions, then it can purchase Australian carbon credits to offset this.

These carbon offsets, however, are plagued with credibility problems. In fact, another federal government review is underway to examine the issues.

Read more: 'Untenable': even companies profiting from Australia's carbon market say the system must change

There are calls to strongly limit or remove questionable offsets linked to the safeguard mechanism.

For instance, climate science professor Mark Howden argued recently that offsets should not be used to give big emitters a “free ride” to continue polluting if they invest in carbon sequestration projects, at this stage. Instead, the immediate priorities should be limiting fossil fuel combustion burning, and making concrete plans for other industries to transition.

Despite this, the federal government is considering expanding trade in these and potentially other types of carbon credits.

The government is proposing a new type of carbon credit for companies emitting below their baseline. For instance, if an aluminium smelter reduced its emissions over 2024 and 2025, it could be granted credits to sell to others in the carbon market.

The government is also considering allowing companies to trade carbon credits on an international level, pending reforms to address integrity issues in safeguard mechanism like the baseline headroom problem.

Read more: Australia may be heading for emissions trading between big polluters

The international trade in carbon credits has been plagued with problems for 20 years. A 2021 literature review found little evidence demonstrating causal effect of carbon trading markets on emissions reduction.

It puts a strong case forward against linking carbon markets internationally, after Europe, Quebec and California case studies show linking carbon markets has led to price crashes and volatility – not stability.

The risk of a weak carbon trading market

We can expect industry to continue to lobby for a weak safeguard mechanism and carbon credit rules. But if the Labor government is genuine about wanting to reduce Australia’s emissions, our biggest polluters cannot be allowed to carry on emitting as usual.

And there is no role for a carbon trading policy that excuses big emitters from making clean energy transition plans.

Labor may need the numerous pro-climate independent senators or the Greens to make changes signalled in the safeguard consultation paper. They are unlikely to be satisfied with a weak carbon trading scheme.

Any proposed changes that undermine Australia’s emissions reduction goals will not easily be passed."
b5448000-952c-419f-b432-d8adc145e35c,"The water began warming in the Gulf of Alaska in late 2013. Within a few months, sea surface temperatures had increased by an average of 5 degrees Fahrenheit, and in places by as much as 7°F. Initially affecting an area of ocean approximately 500 miles across and 300 feet deep, by mid-2014 it had more than doubled in size before ultimately stretching 2,000 miles from Alaska to Mexico. Scientists called it the blob, an example of a phenomenon known as marine heat waves, and over the course of three years it turned the North Pacific ecosystem inside out and upside down.

Plankton and krill numbers crashed. Numbers of Pacific cod off Alaska diminished,= before ultimately the population collapsed. Starving sea lions washed ashore in their thousands, and massive numbers of seabirds died. Without krill to eat, humpback whales turned to anchovy, in search of which they swam closer to shore and became entangled in fishing gear. Humpback whale births also fell 75 percent in the subsequent six years. Toxic algal blooms shuttered crab fisheries. The food web shifted from one supported by tiny crustaceans to one dominated by nutritionally-poor gelatinous organisms called pyrosomes that had never been recorded so far north.

Marine heat waves are defined as sharp spikes of anomalously warm temperature that last at least five days, although many persist for weeks or months. Fueled by climate change-caused ocean warming they can impact marine ecosystems for years after the water has cooled again. As the effects of climate change become increasingly embedded around the world, marine heat waves are increasing in frequency and intensity—posing, says oceanographer Hillary Scannell, “a very big concern” for ocean environments.

Marine heat waves are increasing

Just as scientists were coming to grips with the unfolding events in the northeastern Pacific, a group of 15 ocean experts gathered in Perth, Western Australia, to pull together the emerging science on marine heat waves. Their meeting was prompted not by the blob, the full nature of which was only just emerging, but a warming event during the summer of 2010-11 in which the waters off western Australia heated up an astonishing 11°F, killing huge swathes of kelp forest and large numbers of animals, from abalone and scallops to penguins.

At that time, says Eric Oliver, now of Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, Canada, who was at the meeting, the science was in its relative infancy; since then, however, interest in the subject has exploded.

“I think the first use of the term marine heat wave was in 2010, 2011, something like that,” he says. “I used to know all the papers that would come out. Now, I can't keep track of them.”

That increase in scientific study reflects a growth in reports of marine heat wave events. In 2016, a marine heat wave off Chile triggered algal blooms that devastated fish farms. From 2015 to 2019, a series of heat waves in the Mediterranean Sea led to multiple mass mortalities of seagrass and coral, heralding what has been called a new normal in the region. In 2021 and 2022, New Zealand experienced its highest ocean temperatures on record, resulting in the bleaching of “millions” of sponges, according to reports.

The precise causes of these heat waves vary, though a warming climate is making them more frequent. The Western Australia event was prompted by a strengthening of the southward-flowing Leeuwen Current, which brought increased amounts of warm water from the Indian Ocean. Similarly, a 2015-16 heat wave in the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand was kicked off by a strengthening of the East Australian Current, which sweeps south from the Coral Sea.

Conversely, a 2019 study found that 60 percent of marine heat waves in the southwestern Atlantic, including one off Brazil in 2013-14, originated in high-pressure systems over the Indian Ocean. The blob was precipitated by what has been called a “ridiculously persistent ridge” of high pressure parked over the North Pacific, preventing cooler air from generating storms that might churn up the water. Consequently, the water stratified and an anomalously warm layer settled on the surface.

Climate change is causing marine heat waves

But there is an underlying element making such heat waves more frequent and more intense: climate change. The ocean has absorbed 90 percent of the extra heat added to the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels, and as a result, the top 2,300 feet of the world’s oceans—where most of that absorbed heat is concentrated—has warmed by about 1.5°F on average since 1901. An ocean that is already warmer could reasonably be expected to be more susceptible to marine heat waves, and that indeed appears to be the case.

A 2020 study in the journal Science concluded that marine heat waves have increased more than 20-fold as a result of climate warming. The authors found that in the first decade after satellites began recording ocean temperatures (i.e., after 1981), there were 27 large marine heat waves, with an average duration of 32 days and an average peak temperature anomaly of 8.5°F; in the 2010s, there were 172, which lasted 48 days on average with an average peak temperature almost 10°F above normal.

Much remains unclear about marine heat waves. For example, explains Nicholas Bond, research scientist at the University of Washington and Washington’s state climatologist, there is the question of why so many persist for weeks or months. “There must be something else that's going on that helps maintain them,” he says. He notes that one explanation is that as the ocean surface warms, it radiates heat into the atmosphere that prevents cloud cover from forming, exposing the seawater to increased sunlight and further warming.

However, enough is known about marine heat waves for scientists to be gravely concerned about their potential impacts. Of special note is the fact that those impacts can last long after the heat waves have disappeared. After three years of the blob, the waters of the northeastern Pacific began to cool in 2016; but years later, scientists are still determining the extent to which the region’s ecosystem is likely to return fully to its pre-Blob status. Similarly, notes Scannell, who is a data scientist with Jupiter Intelligence, Inc., following the 2010-11 Western Australia event, “lots of kelp forests died, and it takes literally decades for those ecosystems to bounce back.”

Oliver is particularly concerned about the potential impact in tropical waters.

“I think that's where it's really worrying,” he says. Life in the tropics, he notes, is adapted to “quite a narrow range of temperatures. So that's where things can get really messy. We can have complete shifts in tropical systems. That’s why people are so concerned about coral reefs.”

As disruptive to marine ecosystems as marine heat waves can be in isolation, Bond notes that they are multiplying and intensifying at the same time as the ocean is facing a raft of other pressures, making heat waves’ potential impacts all the more severe.

“In many parts of the global ocean, fishing is probably at unsustainable levels,” he notes. “There’s just incredible pressure there on those ecosystems. And when you add to that the changes that are occurring due to events like marine heat waves, changes that will reduce the productivity of these systems, it’s very distressing. It’s something we had better recognize before we see collapses that would have tremendous impacts.”"
2a36c867-2c94-40fc-b5b6-6ea13c1a0faa,"The historic heat waves that roasted the U.S. and Europe over the summer may have subsided. But a record marine heat wave is gripping large expanses of the North Atlantic and northern Pacific oceans.

The big picture: It has implications for marine species and extreme weather events, including hurricanes, as climate change exacerbates the problem. NOAA scientists warn it shows no signs of immediately abating.

Driving the news: ""Climate change is making every marine heatwave warmer than the last,"" research scientist Dillon Amaya, who studies marine heat waves at NOAA's Physical Sciences Laboratory, tells Axios.

""Climate change increases the mean temperature of the ocean (i.e., global warming),"" Amaya says. ""Marine heatwaves ride that upward trend and are becoming warmer as a result.""

By the numbers: ""The North Atlantic is currently something like four degrees Celsius warmer than normal, or at least parts of it are. And you end up seeing similar numbers for the North Pacific as well, it's for about four degrees Celsius warmer than normal,"" Amaya says.

State of play: Heat wave conditions in both the North Pacific and the North Atlantic have lasted for some three months. ""For these parts of the world, these temperatures are unprecedented,"" Amaya says.

Vincent Saba, a fishery biologist at NOAA's Northeast Fisheries Science Center, notes it's ""warmed faster in the U.S. Northeast shelf than any other region across the country in the last 15 years.""

Fish biomass was still relatively stable, but scientists had observed changes in marine species in the Northwest Atlantic, Saba said in a phone interview last week.

In the Pacific Ocean, there's a La Niña climate event for the third year in a row. This can lead to warmer than normal conditions in the Northeast Pacific, Amaya said.

Of note: Warming isn't the only impact of climate change.

""We're also talking about an increased concentration of carbon dioxide in the water, which makes the waters more acidic,"" Saba says.

""That can impact shelf species like lobster, highly valuable sea scallops. We're still unclear on what those impacts are.""

Threat level: ""With climate change some marine species will fair better than others,"" Saba says.

Research suggests warmer water species are staying in the U.S. Northeast for longer, while North Atlantic right whales are foraging in different waters as they follow their plankton prey, which have moved locations — raising concerns about ship collisions and entanglement with fishing gear.

It's unclear whether this is due to climate change or warming waters, per Saba.

""We've seen major changes in species distributions,"" he says. ""Warmer water species moving north, and a lot of colder water species moving further north out of the system has kind of been the general trend.""

Research that Saba and his colleagues have conducted found warmer waters were leading to almost all female sea turtles hatching — though projections indicate the biggest long-term threats will be in hatchling mortality as nests and beaches warm up and erosion from sea level rise destroys nests.

Zoom in: Bette Zirkelbach, manager of the Turtle Hospital in the Florida Keys, said along with the hatchlings issue, she's seen an increased prevalence of fibropapillomatosis (FP), a tumor-causing disease that primarily affects green sea turtles.

In the past 12 months, 70% of about 47 turtles admitted to the hospital with FP were diagnosed with internal tumours and had to be euthanized as there's currently no treatment for internal turmors, Zirkelbach said in a phone interview Tuesday.

""Warmer waters cause these tumours to grow,"" she said.

Meanwhile, 20 Kemp's ridley sea turtles were flown to the hospital from New England last year after the critically endangered animals stayed too long in Cape Cod Bay instead of moving out with the Gulf Stream.

""The cold weather hits and they get trapped,"" Zirkelbach said.

What to watch: The marine heat wave isn't just a threat to animals. Models project it may exacerbate the deadly Hurricane Fiona if the storm continues to to track northward and enters the Northwest Atlantic later this week.

If this occurs, it would help Fiona maintain its tropical nature and intensity for longer than if the marine heatwave were not there, Amaya notes. However, ""the strong winds and associated upper ocean mixing may help to cool off parts of the ocean that are really warm right now.""

The bottom line: To break up the marine heat wave, ""the atmospheric wind patterns need to revert back to normal and the ocean would then need time (typically several months) to cool back down without being poked again,"" Amaya says."

Marine heatwaves are extreme rises in ocean temperature over an extended period of time. Their magnitude and frequency have harmful impacts on marine ecosystems, threaten marine biodiversity and negatively impact fisheries, aquaculture and tourism industries.

Higher water temperatures associated with marine heatwaves can also cause extreme weather events such as tropical storms and hurricanes and disrupt the water cycle, making floods, droughts and wildfires on land more likely.

As global ocean temperatures continue to rise, marine heatwaves have become more widespread and are only expected to increase in intensity, duration and frequency in the future owing to human-induced climate change.

Predicting marine heatwave occurrence and duration, as well as understanding their impacts on marine ecosystems, is essential and can help protect ecosystems and local communities.

CAREHeat (deteCtion and threAts of maRinE Heat waves) aims to develop novel strategies to identify marine heatwaves, assess their status and trends and understand their impact on marine life.

The project, which began in March 2022, used near-real time sea surface temperature data available from the Copernicus Marine Service, and has been able to detect and monitor the Mediterranean marine heatwave that occurred this summer.

The team found that this particularly extreme heatwave event started in the second half of April and stretched across the central and northwest Mediterranean Sea. In the area, sea surface temperature increases accelerated around 10 May and, in nearly 10 days, an abrupt change in temperature—from 16°C to 22°C—was observed.

In the Ligurian Sea—an arm of the Mediterranean—the maximum intensity of the heatwave was reached on 21 July, when the mean anomaly reached 5°C. As of 13 September, the heatwave in the Mediterranean is still present.

""We are still observing an averaged sea surface temperature anomaly of around 2°C, which intensified in the northwest Mediterranean where the anomaly is higher than 4°C,"" commented Rosalia Santoleri, CAREHeat Project Coordinator.

The team will continue to monitor the evolution of this heatwave with the aim to understand how the temperature signal propagates below the surface, what are the drivers of this long-lasting extreme event and what impact it has on the Mediterranean marine ecosystem.

KARACHI, Pakistan (Reuters) - Children and women are becoming more vulnerable as tens of thousands of people suffer from infectious and water-borne diseases in flood-hit Pakistan and the death toll from the inundation surpassed 1,500, according to government data and UNICEF on Friday.

As flood waters begin to recede, which officials say may take two to six months, the regions have become infested with diseases including malaria, dengue fever, diarrhoea and skin problems, the southern Sindh provincial government said in a report on Friday.

""Stagnant water is giving rise to the water-borne diseases,"" Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said in an address to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. ""Millions of people are living under open sky.""

Women and children - mostly malnourished and in poor health in rural regions - are particularly vulnerable.

The Sindh report said more than 90,000 people were treated on Thursday alone in the province, which has been the hardest hit by the cataclysmic floods.

It confirmed 588 malaria cases with another 10,604 suspected cases, in addition to the 17,977 diarrhoea and 20,064 skin disease cases reported on Thursday. Some 2.3 million patients have been treated since July 1 in the field and mobile hospitals in the flooded region.

Three other Pakistani provinces also reported tens of thousands of patients visiting make-shift health facilities in flood ravaged areas, officials said, noting acute respiratory problems, skin diseases such as scabies, eye infections and typhoid.

""They don't have specialists and medicines,"" a northwestern resident Ali Haider told Reuters by phone.

A government report in the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province acknowledged the complaints, stating that providing medicines and supplies remained a challenge.

""We're worried about the malaria spread,"" said Noor Ahmad Qazi, director of general health services in southwestern Balochistan province, told Reuters. A health emergency has been declared in the province, he noted.

ECONOMIC LOSSES

Record monsoon rains in south and southwest Pakistan and glacial melt in northern areas triggered the flooding that has affected nearly 33 million people in the South Asian nation of 220 million, sweeping away homes, crops, bridges, roads and livestock and causing an estimated $30 billion of damage.

The losses will slash the country's GDP growth to around 3% from the estimated target of 5% set out in the budget when it had narrowly escaped defaulting on its debt in a balance of payment crisis.

Pakistan was already reeling from economic blows when the floods hit, with its foreign reserves falling as low as one month's worth of imports and its current account deficit widening.

The economy has yet to show any positive response to Islamabad resuming an International Monetary Fund programme delayed since early this year. The Pakistani rupee has been tumbling and inflation has topped 27%.

The National Disaster Management Authority has reported 1,508 flood-related deaths so far, including 536 children and 308 women.

'BEYOND BLEAK'

Hundreds of thousands of displaced people are in dire need of food, shelter, clean drinking water, toilets and medicines. Many have been sleeping in the open by the side of elevated highways.

""I have been in flood-affected areas for the past two days. The situation for families is beyond bleak, and the stories I heard paint a desperate picture,"" said Abdullah Fadil, United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) representative in Pakistan, in a statement.

""All of us on the ground see malnourished children battling diarrhoea and malaria, dengue fever, and many with painful skin conditions.""

Many of the mothers are themselves anaemic and malnourished, unable to breastfeed exhausted or ill underweight babies, he said. Millions of families have little more than rags to protect themselves from the scorching sun as temperatures in some areas exceed 40 degrees Celsius (104°F), Fadil said.

The UNHCR said an estimated 16 million children have been affected, and at least 3.4 million girls and boys remain in need of immediate lifesaving support.

The torrential monsoon, which submerged huge swathes of Pakistan, was a once-in-a-century event likely made more intense by climate change, scientists said on Thursday.

The country received 391 mm (15.4 inches) of rain, or some 190% more than the 30-year average through July and August, a monsoon spell that started early and stretched beyond the usual timeline. Rainfall in the southern province of Sindh shot up to 466% of the average.

c0e64b79-fadf-4c5d-aa65-f83acb1f3b8b,"Scientists have proposed an ambitious plan of refreezing the north and south poles as a way to reverse ice loss.

In a new study, the experts say high-flying aircraft could spray microscopic aerosol particles into the atmosphere at latitudes of 60 degrees north and south.

If released at a height of 43,000 feet (above airliner cruising altitudes), these aerosols would slowly drift poleward, slightly shading the surface beneath.

This extra shade would allow the melting poles to refreeze, alleviating the issues of melting glacial ice and rising sea levels.

The technique would 'abate climate change by deflecting back into space a small fraction of the incoming solar radiation', the scientists say.

The concept, called stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI), would cost a whopping $11 billion (£9.6 billion) a year – but the researchers say this would be cheaper than other climate mitigation methods.

Researchers propose a system of high-flying jets that spray microscopic aerosol particles into the atmosphere at latitudes of 60 degrees north and south

STRATOSPHERIC AEROSOL INJECTION (SAI) Scientists laid out a concept whereby high-flying jets would spray microscopic aerosol particles into the atmosphere at latitudes of 60 degrees north and south. If injected at a height of 43,000 feet (above airliner cruising altitudes), these aerosols would slowly drift poleward, slightly shading the surface beneath. The technique would 'abate climate change by deflecting back into space a small fraction of the incoming solar radiation', the scientists say. Advertisement !- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/au/sciencetech/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - ->

The concept has been laid out in a new study, published in Environmental Research Communications and led by Wake Smith at Yale University.

Researchers acknowledged that the concept is controversial, but argued that it would be 'feasible' and that $11 billion a year is 'extraordinarily cheap' compared to other climate responses such as carbon capture.

'There is widespread and sensible trepidation about deploying aerosols to cool the planet,' said Smith, a lecturer at Yale.

'But if the risk/benefit equation were to pay off anywhere, it would be at the poles.'

Cooling at the poles would provide direct protection for only a small fraction of the planet, though the mid-latitudes should also experience some temperature reduction too, the team admit.

'Nonetheless, any intentional turning of the global thermostat would be of common interest to all of humanity and not merely the province of Arctic and Patagonian nations,' said Smith.

According to Smith and colleagues, particle injections from the jets would be performed seasonally in the long days of the local spring and early summer.

The same fleet of jets could service both hemispheres, ferrying to the opposite pole with the change of seasons.

Pre-existing military air-to-air refuelling aircraft such as the aged KC-135 and the A330 MMRT don't have enough payload at the required altitudes. However, newly designed high-altitude tankers, including one called SAIL-43K, would prove more efficient, the team say

The blankets of aerosols would stretch 60 degrees north and south – roughly level with Anchorage in Alaska and the southern tip of Patagonia.

Pre-existing military air-to-air refuelling aircraft such as the aged KC-135 and the A330 MMRT don't have enough payload at the required altitudes.

However, newly designed high-altitude tankers, including one mentioned in the study called SAIL-43K, would prove more efficient, the team say.

A fleet of roughly 125 such tankers could loft a payload sufficient to cool the poles by 3.6°F (2°C) per year, which would return them close to their pre-industrial average temperatures.

Costs of $11 billion annually is less than one-third the cost of cooling the entire planet by the same 3.6°F magnitude and a tiny fraction of the cost of reaching net zero emissions, according to the experts.

However, the plan is not without drawbacks – the aircraft would of course release their own emissions, which would contribute to global warming.

This extra shade would allow the melting poles to refreeze, alleviating the problem of melting glacial ice and in turn rising sea levels. Pictured, melting ice in the Arctic

What's more, the aerosol would be made up of sulfur dioxide, which in high levels can cause nausea, vomiting, stomach pain and corrosive damage to the airways and lungs.

According to the experts, less than 1 per cent of the global human population lives in the target deployment zones, so the risk to most of humanity is minor.

Smith also acknowledged that the idea would not tackle the underlying causes of climate change; rather, it would rather be something of a sticking plaster for Earth.

'Game changing though this could be in a rapidly warming world, stratospheric aerosol injections merely treat a symptom of climate change but not the underlying disease,' Smith said.

'It's aspirin, not penicillin. It's not a substitute for decarbonisation.'

Sadly, potential methods of tackling the issue of melting glacial ice and rising sea levels are getting more and more urgent, as the poles are warming several times faster than the global average, studies have shown."

Refreezing the north and south poles could be a way to manage the climate crisis, scientists have suggested.

In a new study led by Wake Smith at Yale University, researchers proposed that aerosol particles sprayed into the atmosphere from planes could reverse ice loss by partially blocking sunlight, cooling the ice poles as a result.

Scientists believe this could help manage the issue of rising sea levels by slowing the melting of ice.

The concept is called stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) and would cost £10bn a year, but the researchers say it would cost less than other methods to tackle the climate crisis.

Laid out in the Environmental Research Communications, the plan states roughly 175,000 flights a year would be needed to accomplish this, releasing tonnes of millions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

But Mr Smith, who led the study, warned that the plan would only treat a symptom of the climate crisis and not the cause.

“It’s aspirin, not penicillin. It’s not a substitute for decarbonisation,” he said.

The study is considered controversial because of the number of greenhouse gases that would be released into the atmosphere from the large number of flights carrying the microscopic aerosols.

But the plan is backed by Sir David King, a former government chief scientist and founder of the Centre for Climate Repair (CCR) at Cambridge University, who told Sky News that the climate crisis was at a critical point and requires radical steps.

“The idea is to buy time while we reduce greenhouse gas emissions deeply and rapidly,” he said.

“That’s essential. If we keep on emitting at the current rate, we are cooked.”

Dr Shaun Fitzgerald, the CCR’s director, also told Sky News that the significant number of flights made for the plan would be justified if the “urgent” issue of rising sea levels could be managed as a result.

The researchers also argued that only one per cent of the human population lives in the target deployment zone.

“If the risk-benefit equation were to pay off anywhere, it would be at the poles,” said Mr Smith.

3415bcb7-5ade-498a-8c6d-4195d893728c,"Scientists have come up with a strange new plan - and it involves refreezing the North and South Poles and dialing down the global thermostat with 125 jets.

The high-flying jets could spray microscopic aerosol particles into the atmosphere to help reflect sunlight and cool down the melting icecaps.

Roughly 175,000 flights a year would be needed to accomplish this, releasing tonnes of millions of carbon dioxide.

However, a former UK chief scientist backed the plans and told Sky News that polar warming is essential- and refreezing the ice could quell global sea levels rising.

Wake Smith led this new study at Yale University in the United States.

He said the plan would treat an acute symptom of climate change but not the ultimate cause.

""It's aspirin, not penicillin. It's not a substitute for decarbonisation,"" he said.

In this plan, 125 military air-to-air refuelling tankers would release a cloud of microscopic sulphur dioxide particles at an altitude of 43,000ft (13km) 60 degrees in both hemispheres.

The particles will then slowly drift towards the poles on high-altitude winds, which would slightly shade the Earth's surface beneath.

The plan is controversial due to the vast number of flights which is around two days of global air traffic in 2021.

It would release greenhouse gases into the upper atmosphere, causing more damage.

Also, th £10bn a year cost of the initiative would be far less than carbon capture or other ways of adapting to change, researchers add.

""Any intentional turning of the global thermostat would be of common interest to all of humanity,"" Smith said.

Both poles are significantly getting warmer several times faster than the global average.

And earlier this year, record-breaking heatwaves were reported in both the Arctic and the Antarctic.

The Centre for Climate Repair (CCR) is working on a strategy in its labs to help brighten up the clouds over the Arctic Ocean.

Also, a fleet of ships pumps seawater into the atmosphere. The clouds would reflect sunlight back into outer space, resulting in ice cooling.

The floods brought by record monsoon rains and glacial melt in northern mountains have hit 33 million of a population of 220 million, sweeping away homes, transport, crops and livestock in damage estimated at $US30 billion ($A44.5 billion).

The tally of dead stands at 1486, about 530 children among them, the National Disaster Management Authority said, as it released its first countrywide total since September 9, a period that saw 90 more people die.

Over the last few weeks, authorities have thrown up barriers to keep the flood waters out of key structures such as power stations as well as homes, while farmers who stayed to try and save their cattle faced a new threat as fodder began to run out.

The government and the United Nations have blamed climate change for the surging waters, in the wake of record-breaking summer temperatures, that have driven thousands from their homes to live in tents or along highways in the open.

Pakistan received 391mm of rain, or nearly 190 per cent more than the 30-year average, in July and August. That figure climbed to 466 per cent for one of the worst-affected areas, the southern province of Sindh.

Aid flights from the United Arab Emirates and the United States arrived in the country on Thursday, the foreign ministry said. The United Nations is assessing reconstruction needs."
6e4370f5-a1ed-4c10-a03f-e101d2a8b033,"Climate change may have increased rainfall by up to 50 per cent in two southern Pakistan provinces, but global warming was not the biggest cause of catastrophic flooding that has killed more than 1500 people, a new study says.

Pakistan's overall vulnerability, including people living in harm's way, is the chief factor in the disaster that at one point submerged a third of the country.

But human-caused ""climate change also plays a really important role here"", according to the study's senior author Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College of London.

There are many ingredients to the ongoing humanitarian crisis - some meteorological, some economic, some societal, some historic and construction oriented.

With such complications and limitations, the team of international scientists looking at the disaster could not quantify how much climate change had increased the likelihood and frequency of the flooding.

The study was released on Thursday but has not yet been peer reviewed.

What happened ""would have been a disastrously high rainfall event without climate change, but it's worse because of climate change"", Otto said.

""And especially in this highly vulnerable region, small changes matter a lot.""

But other human factors that put people in harm's way and were not adequate to control the water were even bigger influences.

""This disaster was the result of vulnerability that was constructed over many, many years,"" study team member Ayesha Siddiqi, of the University of Cambridge, said.

August rainfall in the Sindh and Balochistan provinces - together nearly the size of Spain - was eight and nearly seven times normal amounts respectively, while the country as a whole had three-and-a-half times its normal rainfall, according to the report by World Weather Attribution (WWA).

The WWA is a collection of mostly volunteer scientists from around the world who do real-time studies of extreme weather to look for the fingerprints of climate change.

The team looked at the two provinces over five days and saw an increase of up to 50 per cent in the intensity of rainfall that was probably due to climate change.

They also looked at the entire Indus region over two months and saw up to a 30 per cent increase in rainfall there.

The scientists not only examined records of past rains, which only go back to 1961, but used computer simulations to compare what happened last month to what would have happened in a world without heat-trapping gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas.

That difference is what they could attribute to climate change.

Study co-author Fahad Saeed, a scientist at Climate Analytics and the Centre for Climate Change and Sustainable Development in Islamabad, Pakistan, said numerous factors made this monsoon season much wetter than normal.

Those factors included a La Nina weather event, the natural cooling of part of the Pacific that alters weather worldwide.

But other factors had the signature of climate change, Saeed said.

A heat wave in the region earlier in the northern summer - which was made 30 times more likely because of climate change - increased the differential between land and water temperatures.

That differential determines how much moisture goes from the ocean to the monsoon and means more of it drops.

""Pakistan has not contributed much in terms of causing global climate change, but sure is having to deal with a massive amount of climate change consequences,"" University of Michigan environment dean Jonathan Overpeck, who was not part of the study, said."

In addition to the rainfall, a heat wave in India and Pakistan earlier this year, also fueled by climate change, worsened the flooding that left a third of Pakistan under water, the scientists found.

The death toll from the floods has risen to nearly 1,500 and the physical damage to the country may surpass $30 billion. More than a million homes are damaged and thousands of schools and health facilities were destroyed."

ff97b8e4-1137-47c4-ad36-7008bbe1f489,"Over 90% of the world’s largest companies will have at least one asset financially exposed to the impacts from a hotter planet in coming decades, such as warehouses or data centers in the path of wildfire or rising flood insurance costs.

And more than a third of those companies will see at least one asset lose 20% or more of its value as a result of global warming, raising the stakes for business decison-makers and the investors putting faith in stock prices.

These figures are among the leading takeaways unearthed in new data out Thursday from a unit of S&P Global. The findings, and an accompanying tool meant to gauge these risks, are part of S&P Global Sustainable1 and are guided by The Climate Service, which S&P bought earlier this year.

It’s also becoming clearer that the stock market will be directly impacted by climate change. Close to 10% of the S&P 500’s SPX, -0.11% total assets would be financially impacted by climate hazards by the 2050s under a business-as-usual scenario. Water stress and extreme heat will have the highest impact, the data tool shows.

“More than ever, investors and companies are seeking advanced analytics to respond to the financial impact of climate change,” said James McMahon, chief executive of The Climate Service.

The tool is meant to help clients get a handle on the “future financial costs of changing hazard exposure for 20,000 companies, down to the rooftop level,” he said.

The business push for S&P also marks increasing awareness that companies and their investors will need everpresent and timely data as climate change evolves, particularly if the SEC continues to move forward with landmark regulation that will require more climate data transparency. JPMorgan Chase & Co.JPM, Fitch Ratings and Morningstar Inc.MORN all released similar products this year.

The S&P Global Sustainable1 product looks at over 870,000 corporate assets such as warehouses and data centers.

It finds that 98% of companies will feel some level of impact by the 2090s under a business-as-usual scenario. And more than 70% of S&P Global 1200 companies in the Utilities, Energy and Materials sectors have at least one asset where the physical risks of climate change are equivalent to 20% or more of that asset’s value under the business-as-usual scenario.

And, if government leaders and the private sector act to tame emissions, the share of large companies with assets at high physical risk could be reduced to 39% by the 2090s (20% reduction) under an emissions scenario consistent with limiting global temperature rises to less than 2 degrees Celsius.

The planet already 1.1 degrees Celsius hotter than before the industrial age. Scientists estimate that several critical planetary systems are at risk of tipping beyond the point of no return, such as Arctic thawing that can raise ocean levels, even if nations curb warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the lower threshold set in the voluntary Paris Agreement.

(Reuters) - Over 90% of the world's largest companies will have at least one asset highly exposed to the physical impacts of climate change by the 2050s, data and analysis from index and ratings provider S&P Global showed on Thursday.

From heatwaves to floods, extreme weather events are increasingly causing upheaval across the globe, pushing companies and investors to seek to better understand and measure the risks to their assets.

If the world continues on the same path as it is now and fails to rein in climate-damaging emissions, 98% of the largest companies - classed as those in the S&P Global 1200 index - could be highly exposed by the 2090s, it added.

However, if the Paris Climate Agreement goal of limiting global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius is reached, the share of large firms with assets at high physical risk could be reduced to 39% over that period.

""Investors and companies are seeking advanced analytics to respond to the financial impact of climate change. Essential to this, is the ability to quantify the financial impact of climate change at asset level to enable meaningful mitigation and adaptation planning,"" James McMahon, Chief Executive Officer of The Climate Service, part of S&P Global, said in a statement.

Using climate models that simulate the physics, chemistry and biology of the atmosphere, lands and oceans, S&P said it was able to evaluate the risk for more than 20,000 companies and over 870,000 asset locations, scoring each on a zero to 100 scale.

By the 2050s, each company would have at least one asset with a score of over 75, which is considered to be at a significantly high risk from extreme heat, extreme cold, wildfire, water stress, drought, coastal flood, fluvial flood and tropical cyclone.

After scoring an asset for physical risk exposure, S&P is then able to calculate the financial impact, allowing companies to adapt their exposure, it said.

""In simple terms, this dataset allows companies and investors to understand their climate risks – and, vitally, what they could cost,"" McMahon said.

9de9ba8e-b99c-4504-a738-6ef1efbf2c6d,"The impacts of climate change are ""heading into uncharted territories of destruction,"" U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres warned on Tuesday on the release of a multi-agency scientific report reviewing the latest research on the subject.

The report, led by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), warns that the world is ""going in the wrong direction"" on climate change.

With greenhouse gas concentrations continuing to rise in the atmosphere and world leaders failing to adopt strategies to hold global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures, the earth is inching closer to dangerous climate tipping points, the United in Science report says.

Already, extreme weather events are more frequent and more intense.

""Heat waves in Europe. Colossal floods in Pakistan. ... There is nothing natural about the new scale of these disasters,"" Guterres said in a video message.

Despite a dip in emissions during coronavirus lockdowns, planet-warming emissions have since soared beyond pre-pandemic levels. Preliminary data reveal that global carbon dioxide emissions in the first half of this year were 1.2% higher than during the same period in 2019, the report finds.

The past seven years were the warmest on record.

The global average temperature has already warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average. And scientists expect the annual average could be anywhere between 1.1C and 1.7C warmer up to 2026 — meaning there's a chance we could pass the 1.5C warming threshold in the next five years.

By the end of the century, without aggressive climate action, global warming is estimated to reach 2.8C.

But even at the current level of warming we could pass several climate tipping points.

The ocean current that moves heat from the tropics into the northern hemisphere, for example, is now at its slowest in 1,000 years — jeopardizing historic weather patterns, says the report, which includes contributions from the U.N. Environment Program and U.N. Office for Disaster Risk Reduction.

Nearly half the world's population is considered highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change — floods, heat, drought, wildfires and storms.

By the 2050s, over 1.6 billion city-dwellers will regularly swelter through three-month average temperatures of at least 35C (95F).

To help communities cope, the WMO has promised to put every person on earth under the protection of an early warning system within the next five years.

Climate impacts are heading into “uncharted territories of destruction”, the head of the UN has warned, as a multi-agency report sets out the scale of the crisis.

The United In Science report, co-ordinated by the UN’s World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), warns that “without ambitious action, the physical and socioeconomic impacts of climate change will be devastating”.

It details greenhouse gas levels – largely carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels – continuing to rise, increasingly high global temperatures and destructive climate-driven floods, droughts and heatwaves already happening around the world.

The report comes as Pakistan suffers from catastrophic flooding, and in the aftermath of searing heat and drought in parts of the world including Europe and the UK, which saw temperatures climb above 40C for the first time on record.

The report warns there is a huge gap between the pledges countries have made under the international Paris Agreement to curb global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels to avoid the worst impacts of climate change and the action they are taking to deliver it.

UN secretary general Antonio Guterres said the report showed the world was “way off track”, with climate action stalling, a failure to help the vulnerable adapt to a changing world and losses from climate disasters of 200 million dollars (£170m) a day.

“Floods, droughts, heatwaves, extreme storms and wildfires are going from bad to worse, breaking records with ever alarming frequency,” he warned.

He pointed to the heatwaves in Europe, floods in Pakistan, and prolonged and severe droughts in China, parts of Africa and the US, and said: “There is nothing natural about the new scale of these disasters.

The current fossil fuel free-for-all must end now. It is a recipe for permanent climate chaos and suffering

“They are the price of humanity’s fossil fuel addiction.

“This year’s United In Science report shows climate impacts heading into uncharted territories of destruction, yet each year we double-down on this fossil fuel addiction, even as the symptoms get rapidly worse,” he said.

“The current fossil fuel free-for-all must end now. It is a recipe for permanent climate chaos and suffering.”

Mr Guterres also called for far more finance from rich nations and development banks to help developing countries and vulnerable communities adapt to climate change and disasters.

The United In Science report shows:

– Levels of climate-warming greenhouse gases in the atmosphere continue to rise.

– Global emissions of carbon dioxide were higher in early 2022 than pre-pandemic levels, after a large but temporary drop in pollution due to lockdowns around the world.

– Greenhouse gases are driving rising temperatures, with the last seven years the warmest on record.

– There is a 48% chance annual average global temperatures will be 1.5C higher than in pre-industrial times in the next five years – temporarily exceeding the more stringent of two thresholds for curbing temperatures under the Paris Agreement.

– There is a 93% chance one of the next five years, 2022 to 2026, will be the hottest on record, analysis from the UK’s Met Office shows.

– Pledges by countries to curb greenhouse gas emissions made last year will not keep global warming to the 1.5C limit; the ambition of those pledges needs to be seven times higher to limit warming to 1.5C and four times higher to meet the less stringent target of 2C of warming.

– Irreversible changes to climate systems, known as “tipping points”, such as melting of the polar ice sheets or heat and humidity levels beyond which outdoor human labour is not possible, cannot be ruled out and could have significant consequences on a regional or even global scale.

– Cities, which are responsible for up to 70% of emissions from human activities, will face increasing impacts of climate change including heatwaves, downpours and coastal flooding, which will combine with the impacts of inequality.

– Billions of people around the world are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, and action to adapt to climate impacts and reduce the risks of disasters are desperately needed.

– Climate change made extreme heat and floods worse in 2022 but early warning systems can reduce risks, losses and deaths – although much of the world’s population does not have access to such schemes.

WMO secretary general Prof Petteri Taalas said: “Climate science is increasingly able to show that many of the extreme weather events that we are experiencing have become more likely and more intense due to human-induced climate change.

“We have seen this repeatedly this year, with tragic effect.

“It is more important than ever that we scale up action on early warning systems to build resilience to current and future climate risks in vulnerable communities.”

The UN, led by the WMO, is working to make early warning systems available to everyone on Earth within five years.

Responding to the report, Tasneem Essop, executive director of the global Climate Action Network of environmental and social organisations and aid agencies, said: “The terrifying picture painted by the United In Science report is already a lived reality for millions of people facing recurring climate disasters.

“The science is clear, yet the addiction to fossil fuels by greedy corporations and rich countries is resulting in losses and damages for communities who have done the least to cause the current climate crisis.”

She called for an end to the dependence on fossil fuels through a transition to clean economies that is fair and equitable, and for the forthcoming Cop27 UN climate summit in Egypt to agree new funding for those already hit by the crisis.

What On Earth 54:02 Who pays for the cost of climate catastrophe in Pakistan? This week, we ask what role Canada needs to play in providing aid to Pakistan as it confronts an ongoing climate hazard. And, a documentary about how the world helped mend the ozone layer, and what lessons it holds for today's climate crisis.

As Pakistan copes with the impacts of extreme flooding, leaders in the developing world want to make financial assistance for such devastation a key topic at the upcoming global climate conference, COP27, in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt.

Record monsoon rains since mid-June, along with glacier melt caused by warmer-than-usual spring temperatures, caused massive floods in Pakistan that have killed at least 1,400 people and destroyed millions of homes.

""The impacts of climate change are becoming more serious,"" Munir Akram, the ambassador and permanent representative of Pakistan to the United Nations, told What On Earth host Laura Lynch.

Akram, who is also the chair of the Group of 77 developing countries (G77) at the UN, wants to see the General Assembly adopt a plan to address the impacts of climate change in countries such as his.

""Developing countries are not responsible for the emissions that are causing global warming and climate change, and in order to adapt to the changes, to participate in the mitigation efforts towards the green global economy, developing countries need financial support and financial investment,"" Akram said.

The plan would, first and foremost, see countries fulfil their longstanding promise to provide $100 billion US per year to developing countries for climate mitigation and adaptation. But even if that commitment was met, it's not intended to cover what's known as ""loss and damage"" — the costs of recovery from climate disasters such as the one Pakistan now faces.

Eddy Perez, the international climate diplomacy manager at Climate Action Network Canada, said developed countries have long backed away from the issue of financial assistance for loss and damage because it leads to questions of legal liability.

Perez called the floods in Pakistan shocking and ""politically horrifying,"" because there is no funding mechanism that countries can apply to when they've suffered climate-related disasters.

""It actually exposes how in 2022 we have not yet created a system that is able to respond to the devastation that Pakistanis are experiencing with these floods,"" he said.

Canada has promised $30 million in humanitarian aid for Pakistan, and will also match donations from individuals up to $3 million. Last year, the federal government doubled its climate finance commitment to $5.3 billion over the next five years — that's Canada's share of the climate funding of $100 billion US per year promised by developed countries.

The G77 is calling for additional funding for countries dealing with loss and damage due to climate change, as well as a new body within the UN to mobilize and distribute financial assistance to countries that have suffered climate-related disasters.

As developing countries push to get loss and damage on the agenda at COP27, Perez hopes to see Canada as a leader in bringing developed countries on board.

Canada played a prominent role on the issue of climate finance at COP26 in Glasgow, co-writing (with Germany) a plan showing how and when developed countries will meet their commitment to deliver the promised $100 billion in climate finance.

Perez believes that this year, Canada's minister for the environment and climate change, Steven Guilbeault, could help advance the issue of financing for loss and damage.

He said he saw hopeful signs in an interview Guilbeault did with the National Observer in May, in which the minister expressed a desire to change discussion around finance for recovery from climate disasters.

""We're not there yet, but we do see openness to address this issue at the highest possible level,"" Perez said.

When asked what Guilbeault intends to do about the issue of loss and damage financing at COP27, a representative from his office responded via email to say the minister has been listening to his counterparts from other countries to understand what constructive developments can be made for COP27 and that more details will follow in the coming months.

Ambassador Akram said Canada could help build consensus among wealthy countries.

""Developing countries will not be able to respond without international solidarity,"" he said. ""We think that the political leadership in the industrial countries must wake up to this fact … because unless we co-operate, unless we have support, climate change is going to defeat us.""

The Big Picture: Solar-powered concerts

When Bryan Adams opened his North American tour in Summerside, P.E.I., on Aug. 31, people behind the scenes were attempting another milestone: the first evening concert in North America to be entirely solar-powered.

It was the idea of BluWave-ai, whose software powers Summerside's smart grid. The city has a large solar farm adjacent to the concert venue, Credit Union Place, but since the show was at night, all systems would have to run off battery power from energy collected during the day.

There were two key unknowns. BluWave-ai could make estimates, but it didn't really know how much energy it would take to power the sound, lights and even air conditioning for the huge space. In the end, they were sure the battery would have enough capacity — 276 kilowatts, roughly what it would take to run 3,000 100-watt light bulbs for three hours — to get through the concert.

But there was a second concern. ""What's Mother Nature going to give on that day? Because what Mother Nature gives and Bryan Adams uses kind of has to match up,"" said BluWave-ai CEO Devashish Paul.

As things turned out, the weather co-operated and by the end of the show, there was still a little juice left in the battery.

The potential is significant. Paul noted that the halftime show at the NFL's Super Bowl is run off a diesel generator on the sidelines because the production company is concerned about how robust the stadium's electrical systems are.

That's a much larger scale, but what happened at the Bryan Adams show could be adapted. ""Just charge up these batteries and truck them in, just like you'd truck in diesel, and you can run the Super Bowl halftime show off daytime solar,"" he said. ""We can decarbonize and still run our shows.""

Hot and bothered: Provocative ideas from around the web

Rather than sell it or take it public, Yvon Chouinard, the billionaire founder of Patagonia, has decided to give his clothing company away to a public trust that will use the profits to combat global warming.

How do tides and turbines affect sea life? Fundy study hopes to find out

(Andrew Vaughan/The Canadian Press)

Harnessing power from the tides has tremendous potential, but in the Bay of Fundy, between New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, developing it responsibly offers as many challenges as opportunities.

Researchers hope that creating a new atlas of vital fish species that depend on the area will answer questions that could lead to more sustainable development of tidal power.

The Fundy Ocean Research Centre for Energy (FORCE) is leading a collaborative project to develop predictive models of where key species will be found in the Minas Passage based on environmental conditions. This would then be used to establish the likelihood that fish would be present in the same area as tidal turbines.

""You can't develop tidal power alone. It's something that's a societal issue,"" said Dan Hasselman, science director for FORCE. ""And so the answer has to be a society-based answer. And that means going into this with our eyes wide open and understanding the risks of tidal power.""

The risk assessment project is researching nine marine species, including ones important for commercial fisheries, like striped bass and alewife, as well as ecologically and culturally significant species such as American eel, tomcod and white sharks.

In the past, tidal energy projects in the area have been met with concern from harvesters and Mi'kmaw groups over the potential impact on culturally, economically and ecologically important species.

This project is using acoustic fish tagging to examine the movement of species in the Minas Passage, where FORCE has a demonstration turbine. It's also considering environmental factors such as water temperature, speed and direction as well as sea surface height and depth.

Charles Bangley, a research associate at Dalhousie University who's working with the project, said these are combined in a model that serves as a forecast of fish distribution. ""It could identify the times of year that we're likely to have Atlantic salmon moving through Minas Passage,"" he said.

Project data suggests striped bass surf the outgoing tide through the Minas Passage during their fall migration. White sharks and dogfish pass back and forth through the Minas Passage, and dogfish also hang around the area.

Work on the project is expected to wrap up at the end of this year.

Darren Porter, a commercial fisherman in the area, said the risk assessment project can address existing questions about fish distribution in the Bay of Fundy, but more research is needed on the impacts of tidal power.

""The project will not determine the effects of tidal power, that's not going to happen. But it will help with knowledge gaps that FORCE and the province have, with their understanding of how fish move in that system. And that's important because just because it's green doesn't mean it's blue.""

Andrea Copping, a senior research scientist at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Wash., said there are a number of potential risks to marine life from tidal power. These include underwater noise, electromagnetic fields, disturbance of bottom habitat and displacement of animals from areas because they're avoiding turbines, although research suggests the first two are very low risk. Of the potential effects, she said the possibility of animals coming into contact with turbines remains the most difficult to assess.

Copping said that while she's ""very enthused about renewable energies,"" she isn't ""pro-tidal or pro-any wave device.""

These devices ""need to prove themselves ... obviously, technically and economically and all that, but environmentally.""

303628c7-66fd-447e-9d5d-c6a7edf5d285,"GENEVA (AP) — With weather disasters costing $200 million a day and irreversible climate catastrophe looming, the world is “heading in the wrong direction,” the United Nations says in a new report that pulls together the latest science on climate change.

The World Meteorological Organization, in the latest stark warning about global warming, said weather-related disasters have increased fivefold over the last 50 years and are killing 115 people per day on average – and the fallout is poised to worsen.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres cited the floods in Pakistan, heat waves in Europe, droughts in places such as China, the Horn of Africa, and the United States – and pointed the finger at fossil fuels.

“There is nothing natural about the new scale of these disasters. They are the price of humanity’s fossil fuel addiction,” he said. “This year’s United in Science report shows climate impacts heading into uncharted territories of destruction.”

“Yet each year we double-down on this fossil fuel addiction, even as the symptoms get rapidly worse,” he added.

The report, drawn from data compiled by several U.N. agencies and partners, cited a 48 percent chance that global temperature rise compared to pre-industrial times will reach 1.5 degree Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) in the next five years. There’s a 93 percent percent chance that one year in the next five will see record heat.

It comes amid fresh warnings from scientists last week that four climate “tipping points” will likely be triggered if that temperature threshold — set in the 2015 Paris climate accord — is passed.

Many governments are already trying to address the threat of more severe weather due to climate change, and data show that deaths from natural disasters are down in recent years. Yet the economic cost of climate-induced catastrophes is projected to rise sharply.

The U.N. report says such “losses and damages” can be limited by timely action to prevent further warming and adapt to the temperature increases that are now inevitable. Questions around compensation for the damage that poor nations suffer as a result of emissions produced by rich countries will play a major role at the upcoming U.N. climate talks in Egypt this fall.

Former Kiribati president Anote Tong and former Palau president Thomas Remengesau, who represent the Pacific Elders Voice group, said the Australian government’s target to cut greenhouse gases 43 per cent by 2030 didn’t meet the standard required of a signatory of the 2015 Paris Agreement.

Australia has pledged emissions reduction levels consistent with limiting global warming as close as possible to 1.5 degrees. Labor’s 43 per cent target, passed into law on September 8, is consistent with 2 degrees warming or more.

The Albanese government has said it would support new coal and gas projects if the economic and environmental cases stack up."
1a93c0c7-f685-4e61-b1ab-b71be77207b8,"Former Pacific leaders have called on the Australian government to stop “contradicting” itself on climate action.

The Australian government is hoping to host COP 29 in 2024, but former Kiribati president Anote Tong said it would be “wrong”, considering the current continued support for new oil and gas projects.

Mr Tong and his fellow Pacific Elders Voice colleague Thomas Remengesau Jr – the former president of Palau – have spent time in Canberra this week meeting with government, opposition, and crossbench MPs and senators.

It follows the official legislation of a 43 per cent minimum emissions reduction by 2030, and net zero by 2050.

The pair have welcomed the call for Australia, on behalf of the Pacific region, to host the international climate conference, but called for them to do better in order to prevent island countries like their own from “completely disappearing” by 2060.

“We are very conscious of the fact that the current government is willing to take a more proactive stance on climate change and wants to be more proactive with respect to the Pacific,” Mr Tong said.

“(But) it would appear to be a contradiction (that Australia wants to host COP 29 while still approving new fossil fuel projects.

“It just doesn’t make sense.

“We support Australia hosting because it would be in our part of the world and we want to be part of it, but to be part of something that’s not doing the right thing is wrong.”

Mr Tong said COP was a forum that “really should be addressing” the progress.

“We cannot morally feel right to ask people to come when we’re not doing enough,” he said.

Mr Tong – who in 2015 lead the call for a moratorium on new fossil fuel projects – said he was still asking world leaders for the same commitment.

“Because according to the UN Secretary General, in order to survive as a species, we need to leave what’s in the ground underground,” he said.

“Climate change is the primary stability issue.”

Independent Senator David Pocock said the ongoing burning of oil and gas was causing significant harm to the Pacific Islands.

“We’re at a point in our history where we have to have a look at our actions going forward,” he said.

“(The Pacific elders) have shown leadership that we’ve been missing here in Australia.”"

Kiribati's former president Anote Tong and Palau's former president Tommy Remengesau Jr met with MPs in Canberra on Wednesday to push for stronger action on climate change, and to stop new projects.

When asked about the federal government's bid to co-host the United Nations COP 29 climate summit in 2024 with its Pacific neighbours, Mr Tong said it would ""appear to be a contradiction"" with support for fossil fuels.

""It doesn't make sense,"" he told reporters in Canberra.

""We support Australia hosting because it would be in our part of the world ... but to be part of something that's not doing the right thing, is wrong.""

Mr Remengesau said Pacific nations were facing a ""very delicate, very perilous moment"".

""We want Australia as the big brother to set the tone and walk the talk for all of us,"" he said.

""That would be a perfect opportunity for the Pacific to come together truly as a family and show the rest of the world that we are doing something meaningful in our own backyard.""

Mr Tong said climate change, rather than the actions of superpowers, was the primary security issue.

He welcomed the government's newly legislated emissions target, but said policies could be more ambitious.

""Unless we can do more on climate change, our future, the future of my grandchildren, our grandchildren will be at stake,"" Mr Tong said.

Independent senator David Pocock, who jointly held the press conference with the former leaders, said Australia had a ""moral responsibility"" to stand with its neighbours.

Meanwhile, Climate Change Minister Chris Bowen on Wednesday announced three new members had been appointed to the Climate Change Authority - Dr Virginia Marshall, Professor Lesley Hughes, and Sam Mostyn.

Senator Pocock said the appointments were a ""great first step"" but he wanted to see more people with climate science backgrounds.

""We can't be in a situation where every change of government we just see all these appointments that align with their ideology,"" he said."
d7b6956b-4925-43ac-924b-de68b42c2950,"There are several ways to react to a summer of harrowing climate disasters – from indifference to simmering angst to deflating the tire of an SUV – but for Eve Simonsen, the most logical response was to take her two children two hours from home to learn how to build a temporary shelter made of sticks and heaped leaves.

Simonsen was one of about 30 people to take part in a recent wilderness survival course held in a patch of forest in upstate New York, which I joined. Several of the participants who scoured for twigs to make a fire and labored to set traps for unsuspecting animals said they wanted to learn such skills to help prepare for the cascading impacts of climate breakdown.

“I want them to be more prepared than I am,” Simonsen said, nodding towards her 12-year-old daughter and nine-year-old son. “I want them to be more aware and ready to deal with whatever is coming. I don’t think it’s going to be as dramatic and Hollywood as Mad Max, but yes, I think that’s the direction that things are headed in.”

Simonsen, an entrepreneur who lives in New York City, said she frets about a looming water crisis; her friends share her growing unease about the shifting climate. The recent discovery of dinosaur tracks in Texas, uncovered by a dried-up riverbed, caused by a severe drought worsened by the climate crisis, was particularly alarming to her. “I think about that kind of shit, it trips me out,” she said. “These things are happening all over the place and are more rapid. So I’m constantly like, ‘What’s my plan? Where can I go?’”

Her agitation could prove to be a touch premature. Societal breakdown has not arrived, and climate scientists are clear the very worst consequences of global heating can still be averted by concerted action to reduce carbon emissions and funding for various adaptive measures.

But the contours of such a collapse aren’t too hard to imagine, following the convulsions from two years of pandemic and a seemingly endless carousel of climate disasters around the world.

Just this summer, a third of Pakistan has been submerged by floodwater, displacing millions of people and causing a “climate-induced humanitarian disaster” of “epic proportions”, according to its government. China has experienced perhaps the worst heatwave in recorded history; the Amazon may already be turning into grassland; there were wildfires in a boiling London and long-lost second world war ships and bombs, like Texas’s dinosaur footprints, have emerged from parched European rivers. The US has been strafed by everything from roiling heat in California to floods in Kentucky. The climate crisis used to be a distant, ignorable topic.

Now, according to recent polling by Yale University, a third of all Americans now believe they have personally suffered from its impacts.

Shane Hobel, who runs the wilderness course in rural New York, said there had been a surge in interest for his services – not from committed preppers who live in bunkers surrounded by rifles and tinned food but from city-dwelling doctors, lawyers, architects. “I’ve never heard people as desperate as now, you can hear it in their voices,” Hobel said. “They all show up carrying the same fear, that food and water supplies are going to be a concern, that they will need to know these skills. Everything is volatile from climate down to politics down to religion, down to all of it,” he added.

Hobel, who wears a long, greying ponytail, has led an eclectic life: he was once a stuntman and motorcycle instructor and now moonlights as both a private investigator and survival consultant for the film and TV industry (he once helped track down two escaped panthers in a nearby county). He draws upon his Native American heritage and training for the courses.

Over the past five years, he has run a variety of survival programs from his property, a 90-acre wedge of land a few miles east of the Hudson river and near the Appalachian trail. A reputed former mob hangout – a burned-out jalopy is near the campsite – the land contains several derelict buildings that Hobel considers too cold and mold-infested to occupy. Instead, he has spent the past five years living in a small tent.

“I’m the only person that I know who would put up with this shit. Everyone I know is like, ‘Shane I don’t know how the fuck you’re doing this, man,’” said Hobel, who blames broken promises by investors to turn the property into a sort of Earth centre, with permaculture and beekeeping, as well as the wilderness courses.

Hobel estimates he spends around $18,000 on takeaway food a year because he has no refrigeration and has to pour large containers of water over himself as expeditious showers. The winters are particularly harsh.

The night before the wilderness course began in earnest, several participants pitched tents in a grassy area cut into the mugwort, a rudimentary hut-based kitchen nearby. The stars dazzled and tree frogs trilled. Several of those taking part said they were doing so just to feel closer to nature, to connect to something lost in city living. Others, though, had an eye on a future disaster. “If the worst happens, these skills will at least give you time to work out what to do next,” reasoned Dan, a bearded IT worker.

A larger group of about 30 arrived the following morning to gather in a sort of rustic outdoor classroom erected by Hobel amid the trees. As participants arrived, Hobel, who said he has Algonquin heritage and was given the name “White Feather” by a Native American elder when he was younger, blew into a wooden flute as a welcome.

He explained that our ancestors handed down various outdoor skills to us but that we’ve largely forgotten them through our cosseted modern lifestyles. “We are primitive people living in a sophisticated time,” said Hobel. “Well, we are in the real world now!”

Over the coming hours, Hobel teaches the group how to construct a “debris hut”, a funnel-like shelter constructed of branches and covered in leaves that provide a place to sleep out in the woods. Every now and then, Hobel would pause to bark out “grey squirrel!” or “pileated woodpecker!” in response to calls made by animals among the trees.

There is also advice on how to build fires, culminating in a test where everyone has to each put together a pile of twigs and branches and see if it lights from a single match. Your Guardian reporter constructed a sort of log-cabin lattice of sticks that looked superficially impressive but fizzled in a sad anticlimax once lit. “If it did catch you would have the fuel for it to go for a while,” Hobel offered, charitably.

The day rounds off with some knife skills, carving sticks to be made into traps, Hobel demonstrating all the ways people accidentally stab themselves and railing against the unrealistic nature of survival shows such as Alone and Man vs Wild. “Those shows are nonsense!” he said. “It should be man with wild, not versus wild.”

There’s a sense of camaraderie and purpose in the group. Simonsen said should she have to flee New York, ideally to a family farm in Oregon, the new skills would help. “I think everybody should be learning this,” she said.

It’s improbable that 8 million people would be able to file out of New York City to carve out a bucolic life in the woods, of course. Disaster preparedness in the US is often framed around ideas of the go bag and the hoarding of food and water, but climate breakdown is largely a test of systems in place rather than an individual’s ability to defy the worst.

Four days before the wilderness course, a torrential downpour in Jackson, Mississippi, left 150,000 people without safe drinking water, a situation brought about by inadequate infrastructure in an age in which floods, fire and extreme heat are pressing relentlessly upon weak points and systemic neglect.

A few days after the course finished, a major power blackout in California was narrowly avoided only after a desperate text message was sent to residents by the state government, urging them to cut electricity use amid a record heatwave.

“Learning to start a fire is a useful skill to have and having extra water on hand is a good thing to do, too,” said Samantha Montano, an expert in emergency management. “But in Jackson, for example, you’re looking at an extended period of time without safe water. Flint is another extreme example of that. “You can’t stockpile enough water for that length of time, so the problem isn’t solvable at an individual level. The problem is rooted in poor policy decisions over decades.”

Montano said that the US “is not at the point” of system breakdown from climate change or other stresses and that it will be societal action rather than the ability to live in the woods that will maintain that status quo.

“There are a million ways our actions and policies can intervene on climate impacts – if everyone just makes individual decisions for themselves it won’t be a happy ending for most people,” she said. “If we work together and protect systems from breaking down, we have a much greater likelihood to make it through the worst of climate change.”

As the shadows thrown off by the trees grew longer, Hobel’s group was still diligently working on traps, aiming to set the perfect trigger for a rock that would crash on top of an unsuspecting woodland animal.

The day’s training had been long, informative and vaguely cathartic for participants who have felt cramped, anxious and helpless in city life. Your Guardian reporter might now be able to construct a rudimentary shelter and, at a push, a fire, but it will take a lot more to survive, let alone thrive, if ecological breakdown is allowed to unfold."

In early 2020, weeks before anxiety about another crisis roiled the globe, a small group of students gathered in a room at the University of Wisconsin at Eau Claire for a counseling session on worry and grief related to global warming. For an hour, during the first such session at the institution, the students talked through fears and frustrations of a world impacted by climate change.

Lauren Becker, a former student who had worked with the university’s counseling services to make these sessions happen, sat in one day to observe. But at the end of the session, she said she left feeling even more hopeless than before.

It was hard to feel as though there was a “level of understanding of how dire the situation is,” Becker said.

She didn’t blame the counselor —and was grateful they were taking on this task — but she hoped the counseling would acknowledge the physical and psychological toll of climate change on young people, an age group she said is “inheriting” the crisis.

“I think that this is the case in a lot of different arenas where it’s not as informed care as it could be,” she said.

There is a critical need among young people for climate stress counseling services, psychological experts say, especially in university settings. But many therapists and counselors aren’t trained to provide students with this specific type of support, in part because of a lack of research about climate stress as a distinct phenomenon. Still, several universities across the United States are beginning to fill this gap: Some are starting to offer climate stress therapy for students in the form of pilot programs, while others are discussing what might be possible through existing campus counseling services.

Eco-anxiety is commonly used to describe people’s concerns about climate change, but psychologists say it is better to use more general terms such as “climate stress” and “climate distress” — terms that encompass the array of feelings someone may have in response to climate change. Climate stress therapy, experts say, is an effort to validate these emotions, help clients process their responses to climate change and provide coping strategies.

If young people don’t have the right resources and feel “sort of paralyzed in these uncomfortable emotions, then we’re not going to be able to solve this thing,” said Sarah Stoeckl, the assistant director of the University of Oregon’s Office of Sustainability. “We need young people to fight and that means we need to support them.”

Stoeckl’s team at the University of Oregon wants to allocate more resources toward helping students experiencing climate stress, which includes reaching out to the institution’s counseling center. Universities have an obligation, Stoeckl said, to tend to students’ feelings of frustration, anger, fear and powerlessness in the face of climate change.

Psychologists say there’s also an existing imbalance in who seeks these resources, with individuals who outwardly express high levels of climate distress often coming from privileged backgrounds. Though communities of color are disproportionately affected by climate change, Elizabeth Haase, chair of the American Psychiatric Association Committee on Climate Change and Mental Health, explains that a “hierarchy of needs” prevents many of these individuals from addressing their climate distress.

“You don’t have the space to have that kind of change unless you have that degree of privilege, which leaves you with time and energy to work on it,” Haase said.

Those involved in creating climate stress resources say it’s critical to acknowledge perspectives from communities of color and marginalized communities, including those who have long had fundamental worries about how environmental realities impact their lives.

Dan Murphy, a former post-doctoral fellow in professional psychology at the University of Michigan, said he’s hopeful that growing research will give leadership at the institution the authority it needs to say in an “evidence-based way, we need you to address climate stress in the student population.”

From February to April, Murphy and Carolyn Scorpio, a staff social worker for the University of Michigan’s Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), created and facilitated a 10-week pilot therapy group for climate stress through CAPS. For an hour once a week, five students joined them on Zoom.

During the meetings, there was an emphasis on building connections among the students in the group, allowing them to bond over shared feelings and experiences surrounding the climate crisis. Conversations also centered on how students can talk to family and friends who don’t have the same level of concern about climate change. They talked about how to manage despair and grief related to the future of the planet, but also how to find joy and gratitude when immersed in nature.

With climate stress counseling, Scorpio said rather than just consoling, it helps to provide coping strategies to assist students in calming their own nervous systems, and to think about the issues from a different perspective.

Murphy said he began thinking more about addressing climate stress while doing field work for his doctorate in Pittsburgh. Some clients described how thoughts about the climate crisis and dire future of the planet exacerbated existing struggles with severe depression or suicidal thoughts — and he worried he didn’t have the specific training to address some of those concerns.

The American Psychiatric Association does not currently require mental health professionals to have training on climate-related issues. For now, experts say therapists interested in offering climate-specific resources need to seek out tools to do so themselves.

A group of instructors will soon launch a climate psychology certificate in an effort to equip more mental health and allied professionals with the training they need to provide this care. Leslie Davenport, a climate psychology educator and consultant, and Barbara Easterlin, a clinician and consultant specializing in climate psychology, will co-lead the five-week program that begins this month.

Davenport said the certificate program will recognize perspectives from Black and Indigenous people, as well as communities of color, who she noted have experienced “multiple crises” in addition to climate change.

Of the 40 participants who will be accepted into the certificate program, Davenport suspects some of them will be counselors at universities. She hopes this training will teach counselors how to help students cope with their climate stress and find ways to be a part of meaningful change.

“I compare it to something like pain management. If your hand is accidentally slammed in a door, you’re not only going to do things to bring kind of a peaceful state of mind,” Davenport said. “You want to get your hand out of the door, too. The psychological part is really meant to go hand in hand with climate action.”

At Michigan, students in counseling services told Scorpio they struggled to focus on homework and career goals.

“This idea of, ‘What’s the point of doing all this if the world is on fire?’” Scorpio said.

Scorpio and Murphy had the idea for a therapy group on climate stress after consulting with each other about what their clients had been experiencing.

Even as people expressed interest in the possible program, there were challenges: Busy college students couldn’t commit to hour-long sessions, and it was hard to ensure they’d find a secluded space every week.

When they did meet, Scorpio said, the feedback from students was “overwhelmingly positive.” Students valued the sense of community in the group and relished having an intentional space to share their feelings. Some wished the sessions could have lasted longer.

At Western Michigan University, recent graduate Kennedy Williams and her friend Max Offerman organized five “climate cafes” on campus for students last year. The sessions were meant to be informal spaces where people could share their emotional responses to climate change, as outlined by the Climate Psychology Alliance. At meetings, participants would choose an object in nature they resonate with — including leaves, flowers, twigs, stones, shells — sparking conversation and allowing students to connect to each other’s experiences.

One of the main rules: No calls to action.

Some counselors and former students noted that many participating in these climate stress groups are usually already familiar with or entrenched in ways they can address the crisis — solutions they can tackle as individuals. For this reason, they preferred for group sessions to focus on coping with, and expressing, their feelings.

“Climate cafes were really just a safe space to … feel what they’re feeling without the judgment of ‘you’re not doing enough,’” Williams said, “because that leads to burnout really fast.”

Haase said leaders, including university administrators, should validate and respond to students’ concerns about climate change.

Maddie Loeffler was a sophomore at UW-Eau Claire when she attended the same climate anxiety and grief counseling session as Becker. Loeffler said the counseling session didn’t lessen her stress or sense of hopelessness about climate change. But she didn’t expect it to.

“It’s not about fixing climate anxiety or making it go away. It’s about connecting with people who are experiencing the same thing.”

e8765c3b-75ac-417e-920e-fa1deddbf8bf,"Courtney Howard, an ER doctor in Yellowknife, remembers the exact moment when the grim reality of the climate crisis hit home.

Back in 2012, when she was a new mother, she read a dramatic article in Rolling Stone magazine, which warned that our worldwide emissions were not even close to where they needed to be to avert a climate catastrophe. For Howard, having a child awakened a deeply protective instinct within her.

“I’d look at my daughter in the morning,” she recalls, “and think, ‘She’s sick. She has caught climate change.”

Almost as bad as the anxiety were the feelings of sadness, helplessness and isolation. When Howard shared her thoughts with colleagues, they told her she was catastrophizing. But, she wondered, can one really be catastrophizing if the catastrophe itself is real?

“My colleagues would look at me as though I were the one misunderstanding the situation,” she says. “When you’re with people who haven’t yet tweaked to the dangers of climate change, you can feel incredibly lonely.” In desperation, she sought professional help. “I called a couple of counsellors,” she recalls, “but they didn’t know what to do with me either.”

Howard was suffering from climate anxiety, which researchers have studied since at least 2007. Much like climate change itself, the condition can seem abstract, unless you’re one of the millions of Canadians who’ve experienced it firsthand.

Today, discussions of climate anxiety are starting to move into the mainstream. In a landmark report earlier this year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change flagged deteriorating mental health as a consequence of environmental degradation. And cases are mounting.

A survey of 10,000 young people in 10 countries, reported in the journal Nature, found that two in three respondents are experiencing elevated levels of climate-related fear and sadness — a phenomenon that is most acute in regions plagued by extreme weather.

Yet climate anxiety poses a problem for clinicians, since it expresses itself in wildly diverse ways. Symptoms can include depression, panic attacks, irritability, insomnia, substance abuse and suicidal ideation. The condition can also be difficult to diagnose because the grief itself is often ambiguous: when one experiences climate anxiety, Howard explains, one is mourning a future that hasn’t yet arrived.

People with climate anxiety often don’t know where to turn, says Wayne Gray, a registered social worker who provides counselling through Maple — a Canadian company that offers virtual health care. Although the condition can be damaging, Gray explains, it is often sub-acute. It frequently expresses itself as low-level, omnipresent dread, which undermines well-being without triggering a full-blown crisis. What do you do with feelings like that? Go to the emergency room? Put yourself on a months-long wait list for therapy that may cost $250 a session?

Because the treatments are mostly psychotherapeutic — rather than pharmacological — they aren’t normally covered by provincial health insurance. That’s why Gray recommends online therapy, which can cost less than half the price of in-person sessions.

“For climate anxiety, many people have found virtual therapy to be helpful,” he says. “If there’s nothing else the technology has given us, it’s given us access.”

Arguably, though, it’s given us much more. Cassandra Cornacchia is a registered social worker who offers counselling via several organizations, including Inkblot Therapy, a Canadian company that provides digital-first mental-health care. She argues that, for many people, online treatment is not only a workable care model but an ideal one.

Some of its generalized benefits — geographic accessibility, short wait times — are particularly salient for people with eco-anxiety. “With online care, you can usually be connected to a therapist within one or two days,” says Cornacchia. “This is especially helpful if you have anxiety resulting from a sudden event — a forest fire, a flood or a frightening announcement on the news.”

Moreover, people in rural communities, who are most vulnerable to climatic events and yet geographically far from the urban centres where many therapists work, can benefit from ease of access.

Another advantage of virtual therapy is the sheer abundance of options. Climate anxiety, Cornacchia says, is best addressed through a variety of therapeutic modalities — cognitive behavioural therapy to manage challenging thoughts, dialectical therapy to make peace with flux, mindfulness to live more fully in the present — each well suited to some people but poorly suited to others. When geographic proximity is no longer a limiting factor, clients can choose therapists whose approach best matches their needs.

For Cornacchia, one of the biggest perks of online therapy is that people can do it almost anywhere. Her practice is heavily based in mindfulness and eco-therapy, modalities that help people reconnect with nature. By engaging with the natural realm, she says, clients can discover that, although the world may be ailing, it’s far from spoiled. What better place to have this realization than in the outdoors itself? “People can do therapy from their favourite park or their backyard or the beach,” says Cornacchia, “anywhere they can get an internet connection.”

Therapy, of course, isn’t the only path to well-being. After her brush with climate anxiety, Howard found respite in activism. She became a delegate to the Canadian Medical Association council, where she put forth a motion to support research into the health effects of the tarsands. The experience left Howard feeling better — less helpless and ready for the next challenge. “I told myself, ‘You’re not going to solve the whole problem, but you can do your part,’” she says.

Since then, Howard has devoted about 50 per cent of her working hours to advocacy. As a member (and past president) of the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment, she helped lobby both the Canadian Medical Association to divest from fossil fuels and the federal government to phase out coal power, something it has now committed to do. As co-chair of advocacy for the World Health Organization’s Civil Society Working Group on Climate Change and Health, she has lobbied for an international coal phase out, citing medical literature about the respiratory effects of air pollution on young people.

She also speaks publicly about the mental health consequences of climate change — the sadness, anxiety, and guilt — and how people might channel those feelings into political engagement. Her social and professional network now includes leading climate activists in Europe, Latin America, the Canadian North, and the United Kingdom, where she is currently doing a master’s degree in public policy. “I picture all of us standing apart but together,” she says. Anxiety has become a spur to action — and a means of building community.

Cornacchia says that enhanced social connections are one of the best antidotes to the isolation of climate grief. This is yet another way that online forums can help. She remembers hosting a group session for Wellness Together Canada, a service that provides free mental-health support via peer-to-peer networks. On one occasion, there were attendees in every province, from British Columbia, where the forest-fire season keeps intensifying, to Newfoundland, where wind and rain seems fiercer than ever before. The meeting reminded Cornacchia that, although we may feel isolated in our grief, we live under the same sky. “It was beautiful,” she says of the experience. “There was a deep sense of common humanity.”

685d508a-c70d-4fe5-b4c6-69d61ef43732,"Africa is currently bearing the wrath of man-made damage inflicted on the earth. Greenhouse emission is exposing the earth’s atmosphere to more heat than it should take in. The results are aggressive droughts, floods, and cyclones.

The chief economist of the AFDB; Kevin Urama disclosed the broadening disparity between Africa’s climate change relief funds and the cost of damage, at the International Cooperation Forum, held in Egypt.

“African nations received around $18.3 billion in climate finance between 2016 and 2019,” he said.

MR. Urama highlighted the fact that Africa is losing 5-15% of its GDP, despite only contributing 3% of total global emissions. Regardless, the continent is hard-pressed to contribute $1.6 trillion between 2020 and 2030 to meet its Nationally Determination Contributions; a commitment by each country in the United Nations to fight climate change.

“These sums reflect how the crisis is. Climate change affects Africa severely, while the continent contributes to only 3% of global emissions. The global community must meet its $100 billion commitment to help developing countries and African economies to mitigate the impacts of climate change and to adapt to it. Investing in climate adaptation in the context of sustainable development is the best way to cope with the climate change impacts, adding that gas must remain included in the continent’s plan for the gradual transition to clean energy.” He concluded."

A key reason climate-related stresses and disruptions can have such a big impact is precisely because of their effect on the work we do and on the wider system of work we rely on. But little attention has been given to the urgent need to adapt work to climate change.

Our new report on climate impacts at work, released today, documents emerging serious risks.

A female professional told us: “there were days where I simply had to use up sick leave because it was too hot to get safely to work”.

One male sales worker told us about working during the Black Summer of 2019/2020:

Smoke from bushfires two years ago was intolerable. The heat also was horrific at times. During the smokiest days temperatures often shot up to over 40 degrees. It was like the planet Venus. My employer … provided no masks at all at that time, despite numerous requests, even pleadings.

Australia is already 1.4℃ warmer than it was in 1910. Climatic extremes and events like the 2022 floods and Black Summer – as well as many less visible disruptions – are already undermining our capacity to work across different organisations, industries and sectors.

We will have to get better at adapting to our changed climate – and quickly.

What did we find?

We found the effects of climate change on workers reach more widely than than previously thought.

In short, no one is immune to climate harms, whether indoor or outdoor, junior or senior. Given we rely on each others’ work, that means climate change impacts are likely to increasingly “cascade” through society, as the 2022 IPCC report on Australasia details.

Our research comes from a survey of 1,165 workers across ten industries undertaken in the first half of 2022, assisted by six unions. The sample is not representative of the workforce as a whole and is skewed towards types of workers not typically considered on harms from climate change, such as professionals and community and personal service workers.

Previous research has documented the serious ways heat affects workers, especially those outdoors or in poorly cooled spaces. Other studies have found outdoor council workers and delivery cyclists in Sydney are already having to use coping mechanisms such as extra breaks, lighter duties and temporarily stopping work to try to avoid heat stress.

Our data similarly points to heat’s health impacts. Outdoor workers were especially likely to report being tired and fatigued, dehydrated and less productive. They were also more likely to sweat excessively and be sunburnt.

Less recognised is that indoor workers are also being affected by heat and smoke.

These health impacts are serious. Close to 450 people died from the effects of smoke inhalation over the Black Summer. These issues were compounded by the COVID pandemic, notably for those workers who have to had to wear personal protective equipment or work from poorly cooled houses during heatwave conditions.

Climate change can undermine people’s capacity to work in other ways. Some workers reported impacts on the amount and focus of their work. For example, some had to take on new tasks to cover for colleagues who were overwhelmed or furloughed due to the Black Summer fires. A quarter reported having to work additional hours due to emergency situations such as the floods, while others reported they had lost hours, had to take personal leave or even lost their job as a result of climatic events.

There are even impacts from climatic effects on the wider public. Half of the survey respondents reported having to manage angrier customers, while 60% said climatic events had led to staffing disruptions. Some reported extreme weather was causing supply chain disruption.

One male professional said:

The frequency of storm events has noticeably increased, and these storms are often more severe with higher wind speeds and rates of precipitation than in the past. […] Our workload has increased accordingly and risk to people and property has also increased. Management are struggling to come to terms with the frequency and severity of storm events and this is leading to anxiety and conflict with management in relation to the perceived need to close the site, or part of it, during severe weather events. Site closure protects individuals from harm […] but is bad for revenue raising for the many businesses that operate on our site.

Our capacity to work often relies on intricate systems of settlements, infrastructure and services that consist of workplaces and support others. When any of these workplaces are affected, there are flow-on effects.

Author provided

Our survey found more than a third of workers had not been able to travel to work due to climatic factors. If trains don’t run or roads are blocked, it can bring many workplaces to a halt.

We are now enmeshed in a different climate to the one we grew up in – and it will change more.

To make our societies and systems resilient to climate change, we will have to adapt how, where, when we work, who “we” is, what we work on, and why. This adaptation work is urgent. No one is immune.

Despite employees expressing they want companies to commit more to a sustainable future, many doubt corporations will do so.

This is in part thanks to a lack of qualified individuals to fill sustainability roles and few resources and training for existing workers to better incorporate sustainable actions into their jobs.

A new survey from Salesforce details some ways employers can boost workers’ confidence in company efforts to address climate change.

The imminent threat of climate change along with huge opportunities to address the global crisis have led workers to pressure employers to act on sustainability and environmental goals.

However, a shortage of qualified talent at companies to help meet climate commitments largely inhibits widespread progress at the corporate level.

That’s according to a new report from Salesforce that found more than 80 percent of workers want to help their companies meet these goals, but feel they do not provide adequate roles, training and tools to help fight climate change.

Researchers conducted a double-blind survey of 1,297 workers across Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States in August 2022.

“Climate change is the single greatest threat to humanity’s future, and it will take an army of qualified individuals — from carbon accountants to scientists to ecopreneurs — working together to reach a net zero future,” authors of the report wrote. “But without the qualified talent to fill the roles, an already daunting task is nearly impossible.”

One potential solution to this problem lies in the already-employed workforce. Survey results showed 3 in 5 workers are eager to incorporate sustainability into their current role.

However, respondents also felt additional challenges impede corporate progress, including the complex sustainability reporting landscape and low investment in sustainability training.

Story continues

Three in 5 individuals said they’re skeptical their employers will meet sustainability goals in time, while the vast majority of respondents were skeptical companies in general will do so.

But implementing simplified sustainability reporting, training existing employees and hiring new ones with sustainability skills could help boost workers’ trust in companies’ commitments.

“Language in the sustainability field is very technical — there is a language gap. People understand personal sustainability but not corporate sustainability,” a sustainability leader told Salesforce when interviewed about the findings.

Despite 70 percent of workers reporting it’s important their company operates with net-zero emissions, over half did not know whether their company does so, underscoring the “need not just for skilling, but for ensuring overall education for employees around company sustainability commitments and climate goals,” authors said.

Meanwhile, half of respondents said they would leave their current company if they learned it did not follow through on sustainability commitments.

Climate tipping points — the ""points of no return"" past which key components of Earth's climate will begin to irreversibly break down — could be triggered by much lower temperatures than scientists previously thought, with some tipping points potentially already reached. There are also many more potential tipping points than scientists previously identified, according to a new study.

In climatology, a tipping point is defined as a rise in global temperature past which a localized climate system, or ""tipping element"" — such as the Amazon rainforest or the Greenland ice sheet — starts to irreversibly decline. Once a tipping point has been reached, that tipping element will experience runaway effects that essentially doom it forever, even if global temperatures retreat below the tipping point.

The idea of climate tipping points first emerged in a 2008 paper published in the journal PNAS , when researchers identified nine key tipping elements that could reach such a threshold due to human-caused climate change . In the new study, which was published Sept. 9 in the journal Science , a team of researchers reassessed data from more than 200 papers on the subject of tipping points published since 2008. They found that there are now 16 major tipping points, almost all of which could reach the point of no return if global warming continues beyond 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above preindustrial levels.

Earth has already warmed by more than 2 degrees F (1.1 C) above preindustrial levels and, if current warming trends continue, is on track to reach between 3.6 and 5.4 F (2 and 3 C) above preindustrial levels, the study authors said in a statement .

""This sets Earth on course to cross multiple dangerous tipping points that will be disastrous for people across the world,"" study co-author Johan Rockström, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, said in the statement.

Tipping points could be triggered much earlier than previosly expected, according to the new study. (Image credit: Shutterstock)

When the researchers conducted their reassessment, they eliminated two of the original nine tipping points due to insufficient evidence — but then, they identified nine new ones that had been previously overlooked, bringing the toal to 16, they reported in the study.

""Since I first assessed climate tipping points in 2008, the list has grown and our assessment of the risk they pose has increased dramatically,"" co-author Tim Lenton, director of the Global Systems Institute at the University of Exeter in the U.K. and lead author of the original 2008 tipping points paper, said in the statement.

In the new study, the researchers calculated the exact temperature at which each tipping element would be likely to pass its point of no return. Their analysis revealed that five tipping elements — the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets; Arctic permafrost; tropical coral reefs; and a key ocean current in the Labrador Sea — are in the ""danger zone,"" meaning they are quickly approaching their tipping points.

Two of these danger zone tipping points, the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets, are already beyond their lowest potential tipping points of 1.4 F (0.8 C) and 1.8 F (1 C) above preindustrial times respectively, which suggests these two systems may already be beyond saving, researchers wrote.

The other 11 tipping points are listed as ""likely"" or ""possible"" if warming continues past 2.7 F.

Triggering climate tipping points will increase the severity and frequency of extreme events like wildfires. (Image credit: Shutterstock)

Past estimates, such as the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Sixth Assessment Report, published in three parts in 2021 and 2022, suggested that most major tipping points would be reached only if Earth warmed past 3.6 F, which would give humanity more time to prepare mitigation and adaptation strategies. But according to the new study, those tipping points may be closer than expected.

One explanation for this accelerated timeline is that researchers now fully understand the interconnectedness of tipping points. Better climate models now show that the fall of one tipping point could increase the likelihood of another's collapse. For example, if the Arctic permafrost melts due to rising temperatures, it will release more carbon into the atmosphere. This will further increase surface temperatures on land and in the oceans, thereby accelerating melt in major ice sheets and stressing coral reefs. In other words, tipping points are stacked up like dominoes; as soon as one falls, the others could swiftly follow.

Therefore, it is imperative to drastically reduce our greenhouse gas emissions immediately before this irreversible chain reaction begins, the researchers warned.

""To maintain liveable conditions on Earth, protect people from rising extremes, and enable stable societies, we must do everything possible to prevent crossing tipping points,"" Rockström said. ""Every tenth of a degree counts.""

Researchers warn that we must rapidly reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. (Image credit: Shutterstock)

But this will be no easy task. To have just a 50% chance of limiting global warming to 2.7 F, greenhouse gas emissions would have to be cut in half by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050, the researchers said in the statement.

Given the meager progress in combating climate change, this goal may seem unachievable. In fact, in some ways, we seem to be moving backward; in June, a U.S. Supreme Court ruling severely limited the federal government's ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions .

However, the study authors argue that it could still be possible to achieve such drastic changes through a different type of tipping point: a social one. This is a theoretical threshold in public opinion that, once passed, will force governments and large corporations to take drastic climate action, the scientists said in the statement.

The only problem is that this social tipping point must be reached well before the climate tipping points are passed — otherwise, it will be too little, too late.

b1d77438-498e-4e00-a506-e3daf1c0f2e7,"The concept of climate tipping points – when changes in an earth system become self-perpetuating and often irreversible – has been around for decades. In recent years, studies have shown how tree loss within the Amazon, for example, creates a feedback loop where the forest is no longer able to sustain itself, fueling further dieback. Similar dynamics have been observed with permafrost thaw, melting glaciers, and coral reef death.

Now, a new study published in Science warns that the world may have already crossed five of these dangerous thresholds with the 1.1 degrees Celsius (1.9 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming that has already occurred. These include the beginning of the collapse of the Greenland and West Antarctic Ice Sheets, tropical coral reef die off, and the abrupt thawing of Northern permafrost.

The research projects that four of these tipping points will move from possible to likely as global temperatures reach 1.5 degrees C of warming, the goal set by nations in the Paris Agreement in 2015. Several other critical tipping points will become likely if global temperatures surpass the 1.5 degree threshold. These include the loss of Barents Sea ice, the melting of mountain glaciers, the dieback of the Amazon rainforest, and changes to the West African monsoon that will impact the Sahel region of Africa.The dieback of boreal forests and the collapse of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, an ocean current which underpins the Gulf Stream, also become possible at 1.5 degrees.

The findings, the first comprehensive assessment of tipping points since 2008, are consistent with a recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change, which showed that some global warming impacts are now unavoidable, even if countries curtail emissions.

“The risk level has gone up since our initial estimates,” said Tim Lenton, a professor of climate change at University of Exeter and one of the new paper’s co-authors. He was also a lead author on the first systematic assessment of climate tipping points in 2008. “Back then, we thought it was 2 degrees of global warming that would push us into the danger zone. But actually, we have already left the space of climate safety.”

The researchers looked at over 200 studies and established minimum and maximum temperature estimates that would trigger various tipping points. “That gave us more basis for not only putting a temperature range on the tipping points, but also hazarding a guess at what temperature would make them likely,” said Lenton. They categorized tipping points as possible when temperatures met the low end of the model estimates, and likely when they passed the center of the range.

“I don’t want people to read this and think, ‘game over,'” said David Armstrong McKay, a climate scientist at the University of Exeter and one of the study’s lead authors. “For the tipping points triggered around 1.5 degrees, there will be huge impacts on people and ecosystems, but those aren’t the ones that have the largest feedback to global warming.” Limiting temperature increases as much as possible would reduce the likelihood of the worst runaway, catastrophic changes.

Some areas needed more research to qualify for inclusion as climate tipping points. For example, the loss of ocean oxygen and changes to the summer monsoon season in India may have a more linear relationship with global temperatures and might not create self-sustaining feedback loops. The researchers also dropped some tipping points that had been included on previous lists, like the loss of Arctic summer sea ice, which may not be self-perpetuating.

Currently, the world is on track to warm about 2.6 to 3 degrees C based on current policies. Even if all current net-zero and emission reduction goals are met, warming would be kept to just below 2 degrees C, which would likely cross six tipping points, according to the study.

“I believe the best – and possibly last – hope we have is to find and trigger good tipping points in society,” said Lenton. “Accelerating the uptake of renewable energy and clean transportation is an example of that.”

Still, the world should prepare for a future where we do pass tipping points, he said. “I don’t want to throw in the towel, but for some things that are likely, such as sea-level rise and coral reef loss, it would be prudent to be planning.”

Even if the world somehow manages to limit future warming to the strictest international temperature goal, four Earth-changing climate “tipping points” are still likely to be triggered with a lot more looming as the planet heats more after that, a new study said.

An international team of scientists looked at 16 climate tipping points — when a warming side effect is irreversible, self-perpetuating and major — and calculated rough temperature thresholds at which they are triggered. None of them are considered likely at current temperatures, though a few are possible. But with only a few more tenths of a degree of warming from now, at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warming since pre-industrial times, four move into the likely range, according to a study in Thursday’s journal Science.

The study said slow but irreversible collapse of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets , more immediate loss of tropical coral reefs around the globe and thawing of high northern permafrost that releases massive amounts of greenhouse gases trapped in now frozen land are four significant tipping points that could be triggered at 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming , which is three-tenths of a degree (half a degree Fahrenheit) warmer than now. Current policies and actions put Earth on a trajectory for about 2.7 degrees Celsius (4.9 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since pre-industrial times, according to some projections.

“Let’s hope we’re not right,” said study co-author Tim Lenton, an Earth systems scientist at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom. “There’s a distinct chance some of these tipping points are going to be unavoidable. And therefore it’s really important we do some more thinking about how we’re going to adapt to the consequences.”

Timing is a key issue for tipping points in two ways: when they become triggered and when they cause harm. And in many cases, such as ice sheet collapses, they could be triggered soon but their impacts even though inevitable take centuries to play out, scientists said. A few, such as the loss of coral reefs, cause more harm in only a decade or two.

“It’s a future generation issue,” said study lead author David Armstrong McKay, a University of Exeter Earth systems scientist. “That ice sheets collapsing is kind of that thousand-year timescale, but it’s still bequeathing an entirely different planet to our descendants.”

The concept of tipping points have been around for more than a decade but this study goes further looking at temperature thresholds for when they may be triggered and what impacts they would have on people and Earth and in the past 15 years or so “the risk levels just keep going up,” Lenton said.

Lenton likes to think of tipping points like someone leaning back on a folding chair.

“When you start tipping over backwards you have in that case a very simple kind of feedback on the forces of gravity operating on propelling you backwards until SPLAT,” Lenton said.

Study co-author Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, likened it to someone lighting a fuse on a bomb “and then the fuse will burn up until the big bang and the big bang may be further down the line.”

While the ice sheets with several meters or yards of potential sea rise can reshape coastline over centuries, Rockstrom said to him the loss of coral reefs is his biggest concern because of the “immediate impacts on human livelihoods.” Hundreds of millions of people, especially poorer tropical area residents, depend on fisheries linked to the coral reefs, McKay said.

With just a few more tenths of a degree new tipping points become more possible and even likely that includes a slow down of northern polar ocean circulation that can ripple into dramatic weather changes especially in Europe, loss of certain areas of Arctic sea ice, glaciers collapsing worldwide and utter failure of the Amazon rain forest.

Some of these tipping points, like the permafrost thaw, add to and accelerate existing warming, but don’t think “it’s game over” if temperatures hit 1.5 degrees of warming, which is quite likely, McKay said.

ADVERTISEMENT

“Even if we do hit some of those tipping points, it will still lock in really substantial impacts we want to avoid, but it doesn’t trigger some sort of runaway climate change process,” McKay said. “That’s not the case at 1.5 degrees. And that means that how much further warming occurs beyond 1.5 is still mostly within our power to effect.”

That’s a crucial point that these are tipping points for individual regional disasters not the planet as a whole, so it’s bad, but not world ending, said climate scientist Zeke Hausfather of the tech company Stripe and Berkeley Earth, who wasn’t part of the study, but said it was important nuanced research that quantified tipping points better than before.

“Have we really contemplated what happens when you mess with our global and ecological systems to that degree?” said University of Miami climate risk scientist Katharine Mach, who wasn’t part of the study. She said it shows ripples and cascades that are troublesome. “This is a profound reason for concern in a changing climate.”

7827b1d7-ba8d-4ff8-b23d-89a69e99470e,"A new study in the journal Science finds that even the most aggressive goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions aren’t sufficient to avoid several major climate change tipping points, in which rising temperatures cause irreversible damages that in turn cause more global warming.

One of the most worrisome risks of climate change, for example, is that permafrost — a layer of frozen soil in the polar regions — will continue to thaw, releasing planet-warming gases such as carbon dioxide and methane that are currently embedded in the soil. Arctic permafrost alone contains roughly 51 times as much carbon as the entirety of 2019’s global emissions, according to NASA, and if it thaws would speed up global warming at an alarming rate. The last two global climate change agreements brokered by the United Nations have set an aspirational goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels, with a fallback goal of 2°C (3.6°F), in order to stave off that kind of catastrophe.

But the new study finds that the permafrost may permanently thaw even if warming stays between the current 1.1°C of warming and 1.5°C, and becomes “likely” if warming falls between 1.5°C and 2°C.

In addition to thawing permafrost, other potential risks include “collapse of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets” and “die-off of low-latitude coral reefs.” If the Greenland ice sheet melts entirely, it could result in 20 feet of sea level rise. Last year a study by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany found that 3 to 6 feet of sea level rise from partial melting of the Greenland ice sheet is already likely to occur, though at its current rate it would take centuries. A full-scale collapse of the ice sheet could have a wide array of dramatic consequences, including the disruption of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation current, a warm band of water that flows to the northeast across the Atlantic Ocean, which would cause much colder winter temperatures in Europe.

Coral reefs — underwater structures in the ocean made from the skeletons of marine invertebrates called coral — create an ecosystem that supports robust plant and animal life, and the mass death of coral reefs would deprive marine life of their habitat, destroying ocean biodiversity.

Another emerging tipping point is the dieback of the Amazon rainforest. The Amazon covers more than 2 million square miles and acts as an enormous carbon sink that helps keep temperature rise in check. Its destruction could release the equivalent of several years’ worth of global carbon emissions. “Dieback” refers to the risk that after logging and wildfires, the Amazon will no longer grow back as rainforest due to warmer temperatures increasing water evaporation and drying out vegetation. A study published in the journal Nature Climate Change in March found that the Amazon may be reaching a tipping point in which dieback begins.

“Since I first assessed climate tipping points in 2008 the list has grown and our assessment of the risk they pose has increased dramatically,” Tim Lenton, a professor of climate change at the University of Exeter in England, who co-authored the new study in Science, said in a statement.

“We can see signs of destabilization already in parts of the West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, in permafrost regions, the Amazon rainforest, and potentially the Atlantic overturning circulation as well,” the Science study’s lead author, David Armstrong McKay, who is affiliated with the Stockholm Resilience Centre and the University of Exeter, said. “The world is already at risk of some tipping points. As global temperatures rise further, more tipping points become possible.”

The study’s publication was timed to coincide with a three-day conference, beginning Monday, to analyze climate tipping points.

Currently, the world is on a course to blow past 1.5°C of warming. Climate Action Tracker (CAT), an independent scientific analysis, studied the national plans to reduce emissions released at the last U.N. Climate Change Conference, in Glasgow, Scotland, and found the world is on course for between 1.7°C and 2.6°C of warming. (The lower number takes lofty promises of far-off emissions reductions at face value, while the higher number is based on the policies nations have actually adopted.) In May the World Meteorological Organization put the world’s chances of breaching 1.5°C of warming at fifty-fifty.

But now it seems that even stronger action might be needed to avert catastrophic climate change. The Science study’s authors argue that their research on tipping points demonstrates just that.

“The chance of crossing tipping points can be reduced by rapidly cutting greenhouse gas emissions, starting immediately,” McKay said.

The peak body for climate action has released a 10-step action plan to fast-track Australia reaching its new emissions reduction target.

Greenhouse gas reduction targets of 43 per cent by 2030, and net-zero by 2050, were locked in last week when the Senate passed the government's proposal with Greens and crossbench support.

A report released by the Climate Council on Tuesday proposes a roadmap for the government to speed up emissions reduction over the next decade.

Among the council's recommendations are enacting a renewable energy storage target and appointing a national energy transition authority to agree on mine closure dates and transition plans.

The authority should take responsibility for planning and forming the workforce needed for building renewable energy infrastructure, the report says.

Implementing mandatory fuel efficiency standards, working with states and territories to replace diesel buses with electric fleets and making all new buildings net zero should be the first priorities.

Climate Council chief executive Amanda McKenzie said the hard work begins now to avoid the worst impacts of a warming planet.

""Our Power Up report is a plug-and-play roadmap for policymakers, with practical science-backed solutions they can implement straight away using today's technology,"" she said.

""It will deliver win-win-win benefits for our climate, cost of living and economy.""

The report found Australia's energy and cost of living crises could be alleviated in the medium to long term by a swift transition to renewable energy and electrification.

It recommended accelerating the energy transition to insulate Australia against international price shocks and supply chain disruptions.

Ms McKenzie said Australia had a choice to make - to take action on the climate crisis or be left behind by the rest of the world.

""A clean, safe and bright future is within our reach and we have the solutions to achieve it,"" she said.

Photosynthesis is the process where leaves convert sunlight and carbon dioxide into oxygen and energy in the form of sugar, which occurs best between 59°F and 86°F (15°C and 30°C).

Canopy leaves are widely accepted to be able to maintain an ideal temperature for photosynthesis, even when the air around them heats up.

However, researchers at Oregon State University have found that the leaves actually struggle to regulate their temperature when it gets too hot.

They predict that global warming could impair the leaves' ability to stay cool and thereby carry out photosynthesis, particularly in warm climates.

Lead author Dr Chris Still said: 'Leaf temperature has long been recognised as important for plant function because of its influence on carbon metabolism and water and energy exchanges.

'If canopy photosynthesis declines with increasing temperature, the ability of forests to act as a carbon sink will be reduced.'

HOW WILL CLIMATE CHANGE AFFECT PHOTOSYNTHESIS? Photosynthesis is the process where leaves convert sunlight and carbon dioxide into their food, which occurs best between 59°F and 86°F (15°C and 30°C). Leaves are thought to have a variety of mechanisms that enable them to keep cool even as the surrounding air temperature rises, in what is known as 'leaf homeothermy'. However, new research from Oregon State University suggests that canopy leaves do not consistently cool themselves below the daytime air temperatures or remain within a narrow temperature range, going against this theory. This means that, as the planet warms due to climate change, leaves will find it difficult to pull carbon dioxide from the atmosphere for photosynthesis.

Photosynthesis is essential for the survival for green plants and releases oxygen as a byproduct, which terrestrial animals inhale to survive.

The rate that carbon is taken in by the plant must exceed the rate of carbon dioxide lost during respiration for it to have 'positive net photosynthesis'.

Leaves are thought to have a variety of mechanisms that enable them to keep cool even as the surrounding air temperature rises, in what is known as 'leaf homeothermy'.

These include changing the leaf's angle relative to the sun, and sacrificing some water as 'sweat' which condenses off its surface and lowers its temperature.

The leaves' ability to do this is necessary to maintain a temperature optimal for photosynthesis, allowing the process to occur faster than it respires.

The mechanisms also decrease the risk of thermal stress and leaf necrosis, or tissue death as a result of limited water flow.

Dr Still said: 'A hypothesis known as limited leaf homeothermy argues that through a combination of functional traits and physiological responses, leaves can keep their daytime temperature close to the best temperature for photosynthesis and below what is damaging for them.

'Specifically, leaves should cool below air temperature at higher temperatures, typically greater than 25 or 30 degrees Celsius.

'That theory also implies that the impact of climate warming on forests will be partially mitigated by the leaves' cooling response.'

But he study, published today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests that leaves in forest canopies are not able to do this.

Researchers used thermal imaging to look at canopy-leaf temperature at numerous well-instrumented sites in North America and Central America over many seasons. Pictured: Rainforest in Panama (stock image)

Researchers used thermal imaging to look at canopy-leaf temperature at numerous well-instrumented sites in North America and Central America over many seasons.

This included the Panamanian rain forest and the high-elevation tree line of Colorado.

The thermal cameras were mounted on towers equipped with systems that measure carbon, water and energy 'fluxes' – exchanges between the forest and atmosphere – as well as a host of environmental variables.

It was found that canopy leaves do not consistently cool themselves below the daytime air temperatures or remain within a narrow temperature range.

In fact, the canopy leaves warmed faster than the air, going against what was predicted by the limited leaf homeothermy theory.

Their temperature actually remained higher than the surroundings for most of the day, only to cool below air temperature in the mid- to late-afternoon.

As future climate warming is likely to lead to even greater canopy leaf temperatures, the observed inability to self-regulate could lead to serious problems for forest trees.

The heat could see the leaves exceed a thermal limit, where negative net photosynthesis begins and the forest mortality risk increases.

'If leaves are generally warmer than the surrounding air, as our findings suggest, trees may be approaching critical thresholds of temperature stress faster than we expect,' said study co-author Andrew Richardson, a professor at Northern Arizona University.

The scientists say that leaf temperature is also affected by their size, which varies according to climate, and habitat, like latitude or the canopy structure.

Plants that grow in hot, dry areas are typically smaller and have a greater ability to reflect sunlight, allowing them to shed more heat.

However, those that grow in warm and wet climates have larger leaves, and could therefore already be approaching or surpassing thresholds for positive net photosynthesis.

Dr Still said: 'Our results have big implications for understating how plants acclimate to warming, and they suggest a limited ability for canopy leaves to regulate their temperature.

'Our data and analyses suggest a warming climate will result in even higher canopy leaf temperatures, likely leading to reduction of carbon assimilation capacity and eventually heat damage.'

A new study led by Oregon State University suggests leaves in forest canopies are not able to cool themselves below the surrounding air temperature, likely meaning trees' ability to avoid damaging temperature increases, and to pull carbon from the atmosphere, will be compromised in a warmer, drier climate.

The findings by an international collaboration that included researchers from multiple universities and government agencies contrast with a prevailing theory in the scientific community that canopy leaves can keep their temperature within an optimal range for photosynthesis—the process through which green plants make their food from sunlight and carbon dioxide.

Published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the research is important for understanding and predicting plant responses to climate change, said lead author Chris Still of the OSU College of Forestry, who notes that multiple studies suggest many of the world's forests are approaching their thermal limit for carbon uptake.

""A hypothesis known as limited leaf homeothermy argues that through a combination of functional traits and physiological responses, leaves can keep their daytime temperature close to the best temperature for photosynthesis and below what is damaging for them,"" said Still. ""Specifically, leaves should cool below air temperature at higher temperatures, typically greater than 25 or 30 degrees Celsius. That theory also implies that the impact of climate warming on forests will be partially mitigated by the leaves' cooling response.""

Still and collaborators used thermal imaging to look at canopy-leaf temperature at numerous well-instrumented sites in North America and Central America—from Panamanian rain forest to the high-elevation tree line in Colorado—and found that canopy leaves do not consistently cool below daytime air temperatures or remain within a narrow temperature range as predicted by the limited leaf homeothermy theory.

The thermal cameras were mounted on towers equipped with systems that measure carbon, water and energy ""fluxes""—exchanges between the forest and atmosphere—as well as a host of environmental variables.

""Using high-frequency, continuous thermal imaging to monitor forest canopies really changes what we can learn about how forests are dealing with the stress of rising temperatures,"" said Andrew Richardson, a professor at Northern Arizona University and a co-author of the study. ""Before thermal cameras, if you wanted to measure canopy temperature you had to stick thermocouples to leaves with Band-Aids and wait until the wind pulled them off. But these cameras let us measure change 24 hours a day, seven days a week, across many seasons and years.""

The study showed that canopy leaves warm faster than air, are warmer than air during most of the day and only cool below air temperature in mid- to late-afternoon. Future climate warming is likely to lead to even greater canopy leaf temperatures, which would negatively impact forest carbon cycling and enhance forest mortality risk, the scientists say.

""Leaf temperature has long been recognized as important for plant function because of its influence on carbon metabolism and water and energy exchanges,"" Still said. ""If canopy photosynthesis declines with increasing temperature, the ability of forests to act as a carbon sink will be reduced.""

Leaf temperature in different habitats is affected by how leaf size varies with climate and latitude as well as canopy structure, Still explains. Large leaves occur primarily in warm and wet climates, and leaf traits like higher reflectance and smaller sizes, which enhance the ability to shed heat and lead to greater cooling, occur mainly in plants growing in hot, dry areas.

In much of the warm, wet tropics, leaf temperature is already approaching or surpassing thresholds for positive net photosynthesis—the carbon fixation rate minus the rate of carbon dioxide lost during plant respiration.

""If leaves are generally warmer than the surrounding air, as our findings suggest, trees may be approaching critical thresholds of temperature stress faster than we expect,"" Richardson said.

""Our results have big implications for understating how plants acclimate to warming, and they suggest a limited ability for canopy leaves to regulate their temperature,"" Still added. ""Our data and analyses suggest a warming climate will result in even higher canopy leaf temperatures, likely leading to reduction of carbon assimilation capacity and eventually heat damage.""

97794869-58ad-4799-8b6a-82068febd038,"Wyoming’s spring 2022 count of strutting male greater sage grouse revealed a 6% increase over 2021, bucking expectations of a continuing decline predicted last fall.

An average of 17.9 male grouse per active lek — about one more per breeding-ground lek than what was counted last year — reveals a population that is “holding steady or stabilizing,” said Nyssa Whitford, Wyoming Game and Fish’s sagebrush and sage grouse biologist.

The uptick can be attributed to the good condition of habitat, Whitford said.

“We went into our lek season with the best habitat available across most of the state.” Nyssa Whitford, Wyoming Game and Fish Department sagebrush and sage grouse biologist

“The stars aligned,” she said. “We got good moisture when we needed it, our winter wasn’t too harsh.

“We went into our lek season with the best habitat available across most of the state,” Whitford said. “It really shows how much of an important role habitat plays in the life of sage grouse.”

Last fall a collection of hunter-harvested grouse wings showed a 0.8 chick/hen ratio presaging a sixth consecutive year of declines in lek counts this spring. A wing-count ratio of 1.5 chicks per hen is necessary to keep a population stable, biologists believe. The annual lek survey is the best estimator of the overall population, biologists believe.

There is nothing suspect about last fall’s wing counts, Whitford said. But those numbers, which are still important to wildlife managers, are not collected with scientific rigor.

“It is extremely useful,” she said of the wing collections. But, because the ratio is derived from a voluntary hunters’ program that collects samples unevenly across the state, the wing ratio “can’t stand on its own,” Whitford said.

“There are a lot of other factors [that determine] where the population ends up,” she said. “This spring is a great example of that.”

Long-term worries

Federal and state personnel, consultants and volunteers counted more than 16,740 strutting grouse on 87% of known, occupied leks this spring. The number of active leks remained steady, Game and Fish reported.

Agency biologists say grouse populations rise and fall in cycles of about six to eight years. “[W]e were pleased to see a slight increase this year and anticipate seeing more in the years to come,” Whitford said in a statement.

Twenty-six years of lek counts compiled by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. (Wyoming Game and Fish Department)

Lek counts in Wyoming had been on a five-year slide until this spring. A graph of the counts made over several decades show peaks and valleys indicating a cyclical population pattern.

In 1996 the number was 12.5, a nadir, according to Game and Fish Department data. But conservationists point to a longer-term diminishment as a continuing worry.

A federal report published last year estimated an 81% decline in the species — which live only in Western North America — over the last 53 years. Wyoming holds an estimated 38% of the world’s greater sage grouse population and habitat.

In last year’s U.S. Geological Survey report, Western Wyoming emerged as a stronghold for the imperiled bird. Nevertheless, the prospect that its West-wide decline might lead to protection under the Endangered Species Act generates worries about land-use restrictions that could curtail industrial development, agricultural use and recreation on federal lands.

Wyoming still allows hunters to shoot sage grouse. The state in recent decades has radically changed its hunting seasons to protect grouse, starting the season later, limiting the number of birds that can be shot in a day, limiting the number of birds a hunter can possess and closing some areas.

Wyoming’s hunting season begins in some parts of the state Sept. 17 and ends Sept. 19 in the northeast and on Sept. 30 in the main portion of the state. Game and Fish asks hunters to drop a wing from each harvested bird into strategically placed barrels.

This year the agency will survey sage grouse hunters specifically, a new undertaking that will occur soon after the hunting season ends.

“Specifically surveying sage grouse hunters will give the department more direct and timely information to inform management decisions,” Jason Carlisle, a Game and Fish biologist, said in a statement. Sage grouse hunters can expect surveys shortly after the hunting season concludes.

A gubernatorial executive order limiting development in sagebrush country seeks to keep habitat intact. The governor’s Sage Grouse Implementation Team administers that order, separate from, but associated with, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department."

The changing seasons tell us much about the workings of nature. Now, a research group from Japan has discovered that the seasonal changes of tree leaf growth and shedding can have a big influence on climate even on small, local scales.

Forests act as intermediaries between the atmosphere and land, reducing surface wind speeds and controlling surface heat budgets, as well as indirectly affecting cloud formation and the energy-water cycle. The forest canopy protects the forest floor from sunlight and reduces diurnal variations in surface air temperature. These effects may alter not only forest ecology, but also the surrounding microclimate. For mountain forests, the effects of global climate change on phenology (periodic biological events, e.g., flowering, in relation to climatic conditions) have been shown, such as an extended growing season for deciduous forests. Changes in forest phenology could also alter local circulation and heat budgets of the low-level atmosphere in surrounding environments.

""However, previous studies have not fully considered the contribution of mountain forests to the nocturnal local climate in downstream areas,"" says senior author of the study, Professor Kenichi Ueno. ""This is what we set out to investigate.""

Specifically, the researchers sought to clarify the effects of leaf expansion (the stage in deciduous plant phenology where leaves expand from buds to mature leaves) on nocturnal temperature inversion (NTI) in mountain basins. NTI is a key factor that characterizes the local climate in mountainous areas, and much of the mountain slopes in central Japan are covered by deciduous forests.

The research team conducted a three-year study of leaf area index (LAI) at a mixed-forest mountain slope site in a small basin. They observed sudden shifts in the development of the nighttime cold-air pool over the basin that were related to leaf expansion and leaf fall. Specifically, they found weakening of the NTI related to leaf expansion, and strengthening after leaf fall. On the basis of these relationships, the researchers concluded that changes in LAI influenced seasonal changes in the development of the nighttime cold-air pool.

""Our results indicated that changeability in daytime forest heat storage can offset nighttime radiative cooling from the forest canopy,"" says Professor Ueno. ""In short, our research has revealed that the cycle of tree leaf growth and leaf shedding in mountain forests has an observable effect on the local climate.""

The results of this study will be applicable to research on the effects of mountain forest processes on nearby areas, such as downwind locations in which human activities are focused, which has important implications for how agricultural areas are designed, and on long-term mountain meteorological records. Future studies are expected to assess the effects of forest phenology of mountain areas on inland nocturnal climates.

727eb252-f169-4ce7-8c97-646b02c8489c,"A new report highlights the near-term impacts of rising sea levels to coastal counties and cities across the country, including parts of Virginia.

Using the average of several simulations, the research team at Climate Central found Virginia has about 160 square miles of land — roughly the size of James City or King George counties — that will fall beneath the average low tide line in the next 30 years.

While there is some flood risk along all of Virginia’s counties and cities that border the waterfront, two of the counties at the highest risk of losing land are located on the Middle Peninsula and Northern Neck — Middlesex and Northumberland counties.

Middlesex County is home to the Urbanna Oyster Festival. Northumberland County is at the east end of U.S. Route 360, adjacent to the Potomac River and Chesapeake Bay.

Taking the average of several simulations, the researchers determined the average sea level in those two counties will be about 1.3 feet higher than their levels from the year 2000. More specifically, the loss of land in those counties is based on how rising sea levels will alter the average position of low tide, which marks the boundary between private property and public waters in Virginia.

In Middlesex County, about 2,500 additional parcels of land, or 17% of all parcels countywide, will fall under that line in the next 30 years.

For Northumberland County, which also has the Great Wicomico River running through it, about 5,900 additional parcels will fall under that low tide line in that time — around 25%.

Losses of private land have broader ramifications for counties and their economies. Initially, the loss of private land can lead to a decrease in property tax revenues for the counties. With less usable land as the water levels rise, individual property owners may also be hesitant to pay taxes on land that is regularly underwater.

Businesses and homes that are near the new tidal zone will have to be removed, relocated or abandoned. Septic systems and underground storage tanks will also need to be removed or at least fortified against corrosion and leakage into the adjacent waterways.

With local money at the risk of drying up, Virginia’s more rural waterfront counties and towns will likely ask the state or federal government for financial help in dealing with the semi-permanent flooding.

The loss of land and property tax revenue for each county will vary, but in Middlesex County, the financial loss would be about 10% in the next 30 years. Losses there and in other coastal counties are likely to accelerate after the middle of the century.

The state is already helping via its participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). Since the beginning of 2021, RGGI has returned $452 million to the state, with about half of that money used to fund the Virginia Community Flood Preparedness Program (the other half is for energy efficiency programs).

Individual municipalities must apply for those flood funds through the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation, with the awards going out in stages. The first two stages have already been awarded, and the third is currently under review.

Most recently, the Middle Peninsula Planning District Commission, which includes Middlesex County, was awarded $336,000 from these funds to develop flood defenses through flood plain restoration and proven vegetated buffer zones. Farther upriver, the town of Tappahannock was awarded about $70,000 for using similar methods to protect areas adjacent to Hoskins Creek.

Other locations in Virginia will be at risk, although the threats will become more serious after 2050.

Tidal gauges in Norfolk, Yorktown and the Northern Neck already show sea level is about 1 to 1.5 feet higher than in 1950, and satellite measurements of sea level since 1993 show the rising water levels are accelerating.

The speed of planetary warming will determine the ultimate amount of sea level rise and how frequently Virginia’s coastlines continue to flood. That rate of warming governs how much land-based glacial ice melts into the oceans and how much the ocean waters physically expand.

But as an average, an additional foot of sea level rise seems nearly unavoidable over the next 30 years along the Virginia waterfront. On the current planetary warming trajectory, an average of 2 to 3 feet of rise is most likely by 2100."
34619bb3-817b-49e2-a3be-11cf4b3bf938,A recent analysis by Climate Central predicts that as much as 8.7% of Louisiana's total taxable land area could be lost to rising sea levels by 2050.
a1965c6c-c834-4599-83a5-539591106851,"Millions of acres and hundreds of thousands of properties are at risk of being swallowed by rising seas by 2050, with Florida, Louisiana and Texas most at risk, according to a new study by the nonprofit Climate Central.

These potential losses would erode property values and shrink tax bases, sapping the financial power of the most heavily affected localities to adapt to the changing coastline.

Florida leads with the number of tax parcels that will be at least partially submerged by the encroaching tidal line, with over 140,000 at risk, while Louisiana leads with the number of fully submerged properties, as well as built properties, facing the same peril.

Climate Central’s study used state-defined tidal lines, which are set by each state individually and derived from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data, to calculate the eroding property tax base on a state and county level.

In Miami-Dade County, for instance, 8,614 parcels with a taxable land value of $2.08 billion will be in the annual flood risk zone by 2030. That number climbs to 14,135 parcels valued at $3.81 billion by 2050, which accounts for 10 percent of the county’s land area. Only Monroe and Charlotte counties in Florida have a higher percentage at risk, per the report.

Florida as a whole has $5.83 billion in land value at risk by 2050, and an additional $1.22 billion in buildings and other improvements, coming in behind only Texas in terms of value.

Compounding the loss in tax revenue, homeowners may object to paying taxes on essentially obsolete parcels, and businesses may petition for lower assessed values if their properties are impaired. In addition, counties and municipalities at risk will have to spend increasingly larger sums on road and infrastructure maintenance, as well as removal of structures deemed precarious and other post-disaster cleanup, resulting in a combination of lower revenue and higher costs, according to the report.

Of course, these projections are all based on current land values. Things may look very different in 2050 — for better or worse. If municipalities invest in mitigation measures and if the population grows for unrelated reasons, the value of the properties and the extent of the flooding could change. On the other hand, if certain tipping points are reached before 2050, there may not be a tax base at all.

With climate change at the forefront of nearly every environmental debate these days, we are getting more and more a sense of the long-lasting impact of global temperatures rising. One of them is likely to be rising sea levels with the impact possibly to be seen at different shores all around the globe. And one of the latest studies from a group of scientists has it that the effects could be seen in the United States much earlier than expected with the damage almost catastrophic.

The non-profit group Climate Central released a report titled ""Sinking Tax Base: Land & Property at Risk from Rising Seas""(via Futurism) that outlined some of the predicted impacts that rising sea levels will have on various areas in the United States. And because everything comes back to bureaucracy, this particular study began by looking at the tax implications that could occur if hundreds and thousands of properties are lost to the damage caused by the influx of water.

According to their data, 4.4 million acres of land or 650,000 different properties could be affected by rising sea levels and would be considered below sea level by the year 2050. In this case, below sea level is the operative term because that means the levels have risen enough to change what had been considered land able to be occupied. But if the sea level changes along the coastlines of various states, many, many properties will no longer be habitable.

The state possibly seeing the most impact from rising sea levels, according to this climate change and sea level study is Louisiana which would lose roughly half a million (or 250,000 individual properties) in the next 30 years. The reason the tax base comes into this is that if there is property loss, then the rateables or places that can be taxed by local or state governments would disappear as well meaning the difference would have to be made up by the remaining properties. This would, in turn, theoretically raise the taxes considerably for the properties remaining.

Whether tax rates and costs should be the primary piece of the puzzle when considering the damage done to coastlines because of climate change and rising sea levels, I suppose, is up for debate. It sure doesn't feel like it should be first on the list when it comes to worries. But it does offer up another area of thought around what happens when/ if the much property or these many homes are lost (presumably for good) in such a short period of time. This isn't like rebuilding after a major storm. This is a permanent loss.

It's worth noting here that scientists don't believe sea level rises will be uniform along all coastlines during this timeline. This is one reason the Louisiana area was slated to maybe see more damage and loss of property. One estimate has four to eight inches of rise along the Pacific coast, 10 to 14 inches along the Atlantic coast, and 14 to 18 inches along the Gulf (where Louisiana sits). This is another situation to monitor, geographically, when determining the impact of climate change on rising sea levels.

8d06a6ec-2b5f-4fdd-a907-3048003ef24f,"Higher high tides, supercharged by rising sea levels, could flood all or parts of an estimated $34 billion worth of real estate along the nation’s coasts within just 30 years, a new report concludes.

Within the span of a 30-year mortgage, as many as 64,000 buildings and roughly 637,000 properties along the ocean and its connecting waterways could be at least partially below the tidal boundary level, the nonprofit Climate Central stated in a report released Thursday morning.

Seas are forecast to rise from 8 inches to 23 inches along the nation’s coasts by 2050, with the higher increases along the northern Gulf Coast and mid-Atlantic. As the oceans rise, every inch of additional water is expected to move farther inland making flood events worse and putting more properties at risk.

Latest climate report:2021's climate extremes show global warming has 'no sign of slowing'

Tax dollars flowing into local governments will sink as rising water claims homes and land, lowering property values and sending a ripple effect through communities, said Don Bain, an engineer and Climate Central senior adviser.

The analysis concluded such losses could triple by 2100 in counties connected to the sea, depending on whether the world can rein in warming temperatures

The nonprofit looked at tax assessment data for 328 counties throughout the U.S. and tidal level property boundaries and elevation. Here’s what its analysis found:

Underwater

More than 48,000 properties could be entirely below the high tide lines by 2050, mostly in Louisiana, Florida and Texas.

Nearly 300,000 buildings could be at least partially under water by 2100. The value of buildings and properties below the high water level could rise to $108 billion, not including some 90 counties where the nonprofit couldn’t get tax assessor data.

Parishes under pressure

Parishes in low-lying Louisiana – where sinking ground compounds the effects of rising sea levels – are forecast to feel the brunt of the impacts. The analysis shows some 8.7% of the state’s total land area could be below water level by 2050.

Thirteen parishes rank in the top 20 among all counties and parishes for the most acres potentially below water level by 2050. More than half of the land in six parishes could be below water level by then, including Terrebonne, LaFourche, St. Charles, St. Mary, St. Bernard and St. John the Baptist.

Animals feel pressure too:Roseate spoonbills feeling the effects of rising seas and warming climate

Elevation matters

A scattering of counties in five other states also could feel bigger impacts.

New Jersey’s Hudson County, across the Hudson River from Manhattan, is among those, with more than 15% of its total acreage below the predicted higher water levels. It leads all counties in the nation with an estimated value of land and buildings at risk: more than $2.4 billion.

Also among the top 20 counties with the most acres predicted below water level by 2050 are:

Middlesex, along the Chesapeake Bay in Virginia

Monroe, home of the Florida Keys

Jefferson, Texas, on the northern Gulf coast at Beaumont

Dare, Tyrell and Currituck counties along North Carolina’s Outer Banks and Albemarle Sound

Among the counties with the greatest property values at stake are:

Galveston, Texas, $2.37 billion

Honolulu, Hawaii, $2.3 billion

Washington, DC, $1.4 billion

Miami-Dade, Florida, $1.3 billion

Losing land

As much as 4.4 million acres could fall below the shoreline boundaries that mark the line between private property and public land by 2050, a number the report estimated would double by 2100. The majority of that land in 2050 – 3.8 million acres – lies in just four states: Louisiana, Florida, North Carolina and Texas.

“Your land is going to be taken from you by the rising seas,” Bain said. “Nobody’s talking about that.”

The analysis used the relevant tidal boundary for each state, whether it's the mean low water line, the mean high water line or the mean higher high water line, then calculated the land within each property that could fall below that boundary as seas rise.

They calculated the exposed tax-assessed value for properties that could be newly affected by higher water and multiplied the value of each property by the fraction forecast to be below the line. They used an entire building’s value when any of the building is at or below the line.

The loss of taxable value could greatly impact the budgets of many towns and counties, said A.R. Siders, an assistant professor in the University of Delaware's Disaster Research Center. “If a town has no other income and is relying solely on property tax values, that town is not sustainable.”

Risky business

Climate Central is among numerous groups working to better define the nation’s climate risk.

The need for such information is huge as mortgage lenders, insurers and others try to discern what the future holds and what it means for business, said Bain, adding it’s important to balance sheets for governments, individuals and corporations.

“Climate change impacts are real,” said Mark Rupp with the Georgetown Climate Center at Georgetown University. “They are happening now, and they are affecting even the business world.

“How many mortgage lenders want to be lending for home mortgages in flood-prone areas, if they don't think that they're going to get paid back?”

Rupp also pointed to the number of insurance carriers who have pulled out of the market in Florida or become insolvent. He said it's critical for local governments to get support from state and federal governments to plan and prepare in advance.

Inspire not frighten

The report’s conclusions aren’t meant to frighten or discourage people, Bain said. He hopes they give people information to influence outcomes and push officials at every level of government to begin working together now to adopt needed laws and regulations.

“I’s not too late to make course corrections,"" Bain said. ""Solving this problem is important because it’s a choice between better outcomes and really bad outcomes.”

By Liz Stillwagon Swan, Ph.D., and Gerry Schramm

We’ve all witnessed the extreme weather phenomena over the past few years: the uncontrollable wildfires out West, the flash floods in the South, the extreme droughts scattered throughout the US. Some of us lived through these horrifying experiences, and the rest of us watched them on TV and social media. A common refrain for those of us who have enjoyed a few trips around the sun is: “I don’t remember these things happening when I was a kid…”

The tide pools of society

Though there are climate change deniers and skeptics, most of us side with the brightest minds in the scientific community, who find weather phenomena to be more extreme than in the past and its patterns less predictable. These experts warn that near-future changes in climate will drastically alter life as we know it.

We can’t turn back the clock, but can we make forward momentum in a less destructive direction? Neil Peart, philosopher, author, drummer and lyricist for the Canadian prog rock trio Rush, gives us a clue in a single word: integrity. Integrity has two different but related meanings: the first is possessing the qualities of honesty, trustworthiness, and responsibility; the second is the quality of wholeness or completeness.

It’s rare for rock bands to sing about the perils of science run amuck, rarer still to have been doing so in 1980 when Rush’s album Permanent Waves came out. In the song, “Natural Science,” on this album, Peart writes about how the “ebbing tide retreats along the rocky shoreline,” leaving behind short-lived tidepools, which represent little bubbles of humanity isolated from the larger whole, whose inhabitants believe their “microcosmic planet” is “a complete society.” While Peart was not explicitly writing about climate change, we find his insights prescient and inspiring.

The lyrics imply a comparison between fractured human societies and the tidepools of “busy little creatures chasing out their destinies” and warn of insularity: “living in their pools they soon forget about the sea.” Humanity has been extremely busy developing in the name of progress at the expense of human well-being and planetary health. Recent climate catastrophes have forcefully reminded us that earth is our home and its systems are out of whack.

There’s a schism between those who accept the reality of climate change and embrace alterations to behavior–both individually and collectively–to ensure future human evolution, and those who deny the changes for presumably self-serving purposes of economic gain and ‘prosperity.’ But can we prosper in our little tidepools, isolated from the larger sea of humanity or will we be washed away by the next high tide, so to speak?

Taming science and nature

Later in the song “Natural Science,” Peart warns that “Science, like nature, must also be tamed with a view towards its preservation.” The scientific revolution was, in large part, about humans gaining control over nature, bending it to our will. We’ve done that with stunning success: mastering global travel; wiping out viruses and preventing diseases; creating industry, technology, comfort, and luxury. But Peart’s warning is to also tame science, which enabled our 21st century lifestyle but also ushered in air, water, and soil pollution. Referring to our obsession with progress at all costs, Peart writes, “In their own image their world is fashioned, no wonder they don’t understand” and “our causes can’t see their effects.”

Recently, we’ve become more aware of the effects (pollution) of our causes (progress). There is a silver lining though: we created the problem with our collective behavior but we can also curb the problem and enable a healthier planet also with our individual and collective behavior.

The integrity to embrace climate change

Access to information via the internet is the sharpest double-edged sword of the 21st century: Universal access to all information sounds ideal but such access without the requisite education to process it effectively ushered in a dangerous hubris. Anti-vaxxers believe they know better than the most knowledgeable epidemiologists in the world, just as climate change deniers question the smartest scientists who know more about the planet than anyone.

There is value in trusting the experts and being honest about what you don’t know: “The most endangered species, the honest man, will still survive annihilation” writes Peart. Honesty here is facing up to the difficult reality of a changing earth and the need to change along with it, or else.

Using integrity as our guiding principle, as did Neil Peart, we need to approach the facts of climate change honestly and responsibly. Unless you’re one of those climate change experts, you don’t know as much as they do, and denying what might be an “inconvenient truth” (Al Gore) isn’t doing anything to prepare future generations for a better future; in fact, evolutionarily speaking, climate change deniers are counterproductive, the fly in the ointment. The other meaning of integrity, of wholeness or completeness, in this context suggests that we must collectively take action to mitigate its effects.

This group is unmoved by the near-universal agreement among scientists on the reality and impact of climate change.

Past research into climate change scepticism has focused on sociodemographics. It has found people are more likely to express scepticism if they are older, male, highly value individualistic beliefs and don’t value the environment.

These characteristics are generally entrenched. It means this information, while interesting, may be of little use when trying to increase public support for climate action.

Our latest study of Australian sceptics focused on potentially more malleable factors – including the thought processes of people who reject climate science messaging. Our findings suggest some people reject consensus science and generate other explanations due to mistrust in climate science and uncritical faith in “alternative science”.

We hope these findings help researchers, scientists and those responsible for public messaging to understand and overcome sceptics’ concerns.

Read more: Almost 90% of us now believe climate change is a problem - across all political persuasions

What factors did the study consider?

For our research, we surveyed 390 Australian climate change sceptics. They were recruited via social media, including from sceptic interest groups and websites. We explored whether the following variables predicted climate change scepticism above and beyond sociodemographic factors:

the extent to which you feel your life’s outcomes are within your personal control, or are mostly influenced by external factors

information-processing style

trust in those who defend the industrial capitalist system against accusations that its activities are causing harm.

We broke scepticism down into four types based on rejection of, or uncertainty about:

the reality of climate change

its causes

its impacts

the need to follow scientific advice.

Read more: Why old-school climate denial has had its day

Similar to previous research, our study found:

older people were more likely to be sceptical of the reality of climate change

conservatives were more likely to be sceptical of the reality, causes and impacts of climate change

lower environmental values were strongly linked to all types of scepticism.

Unlike in the United States, we found religious beliefs had little influence on climate change sceptics in the largely secular Australian population. Instead, they had faith in “alternative” or pseudo-science explanations.

Those who favoured explanations of chance, believing that luck determines outcomes, were also more likely to believe there was no need to act on climate change.

This suggests those who believe outcomes in life are beyond their control are more likely to think individual action on climate change is of little use. Hence, we suggest increased efforts to emphasise the difference individual efforts can make.

Those with stronger individualistic worldviews – their priority is individual autonomy as opposed to a more collectivist worldview – were more sceptical about humans causing climate change.

Contrary to our predictions, people with high analytical abilities were even more likely to be sceptical about this. Our further analyses suggested that mistrust in climate science and uncritical faith in “alternative science” prompted them to reject consensus science and generate other explanations.

Read more: Climate explained: why some people still think climate change isn't real

How people explain their scepticism

We asked participants to explain their scepticism. From their responses, we identified five overarching themes:

faith in alternative science – they offered answers such as “real science concerning solar activity and other factors such as planetary tides” to explain their rejection of climate science belief that climate changes naturally and cyclically – expressions such as “the climate has always changed quite naturally and always will. Nothing we can do about it” defend against the overwhelming evidence of human-enhanced climate change for five decades or more mistrust in climate science – questions such as “how can anyone support a premise supported by consensus science based on adjusted temps?” invoke claims of data manipulation to support the supposedly nefarious aims of climate scientists predictions not becoming reality – explanations such as “seeing climate change alarmists’ predictions being completely false” result from a basic misunderstanding of model-based climate projections (“prediction” is rarely used any more) and probabilities ulterior motives of interested parties – claims such as “the Man-Made climate change HOAX is pushed by the UN to transfer wealth to poorer nations and make wealthier nations poorer” are contradicted by recent studies that suggest soaring adaptation costs in developed countries like Australia will limit their future generosity to poorer neighbours.

Read more: Pacific Islands must stop relying on foreign aid to adapt to climate change, because the money won’t last

So how do we begin to change minds?

In all, our results suggest climate change scepticism may be influenced by:

favoured explanations of pseudoscience and/or belief that events happen by chance

a belief that the problem is too large, complex and costly for individuals to deal with alone.



Unlike sociodemographic characteristics, these thought processes may more open to targeted public messaging.

In the end, reality bites. Multi-year droughts and successive never-before-seen floods will struggle to fit a sceptic narrative of yet another “one-in-100-year event”. Even the attitudes of Australian farmers, including some of the most entrenched sceptics, are shifting.

Climate change is upon us, and scepticism is rapidly becoming a topic for historians, not futurists."
60d153ac-c878-4575-a243-472d6296f3bf,"Sometimes, when reading through reams of climate disinfo, what stands out isn't what one person writes, but when multiple, seemingly disparate people, all hit on the same line. We'll leave the full quantitative analysis to others ( maybe you ?) but for now, we just want to flag that not-racist Alex Epstein isn't the only one pushing the hilariously , intentionally ignorant disinformation line from the 90s ""asking"" 'what if climate change/CO2/fossil fuel emissions are actually a good thing.'

Spoiler alert: they're not, the latest Social Cost of Carbon came in at $185/tonne CO2 , and even the real ""CO2 fertilization"" effect is no longer a good thing ! But none of that matters, because deniers even debunk themselves with this stuff.

Over the Labor Day weekend, three pieces at three different disinfo outlets talking about three different subjects featured that same stupid idea: Maybe scientists who have spent decades calculating how bad climate change is and will be just forgot to look at fossil fuels' benefits.

At the Watts Up With That blog, a guest post (as usual) from Gregory Rummo, former chemical CEO, ""lecturer of chemistry"" at Palm Beach Atlantic University and writer for the Christian climate disinfo-spreading Cornwall Alliance, took issue with a sociologist's paper in a Chemistry journal. Now, far be it for us to play Ivory Tower gatekeeper, but Rummo's complaint about a journal publishing someone from a different field of study is hilariously ironic for denierland, given their history of slipping climate disinfo into dodgy journals for different fields of study , AND that deniers like WUWT's namesake have failed to get their (pseudo)science published in ANY journals.

Given the headline, "" When a Chemistry Journal Publishes a Sociologist on Climate and Energy ,"" and the way Rummo wrote his response, we assumed this was about a peer-reviewed study. But no, clicking through, and it turns out it's just a Chemical and Engineering News interview with developmental sociologist Holly Jean Buck, who has a message for the publication's chemical and engineering audience that Rummo didn't like: We have to stop fossil fuel emissions.

Apparently ""like all too many anti-fossil fuel activists, Buck simply fails to take into account all the direct benefits of fossil fuels—the enormous amount of energy indispensable to lifting and keeping whole societies out of poverty."" Except one of the main points of stopping climate change is to protect societies that burned fossil fuels to build and lift themselves of poverty — and polluted the global climate in the process. And besides, what good is a fancy new house if it burns down or floods?

But Rummo isn't mad that the author of "" Ending Fossil Fuels: Why Net Zero Is Not Enough "" didn't address the benefits of fossil fuels in her actual scholarship about the need to nationalize the fossil fuel industry, he's mad that she didn't answer the interview questions in the way he would have, if he were given such an opportunity. That she didn't heap praise on the industry destroying the climate was just one of his lengthy list of gripes.

It's the same over at the Washington Times, where geophysicist David Deming claims in an op-ed headlined "" the ignorant mob's climate crisis is a hoax, "" that ""the positive benefits of carbon dioxide and warming ought to be balanced against any possible detrimental effects, yet they are rarely discussed.""

Deming of course doesn't cite any supposed cost-benefit analysis that fails to account for the positive benefits, because no such analysis exists. But that doesn't stop deniers from pretending!

Coming closest to showing his work and linking to sources for the outrageous claim that the destruction of the climate in which 10,000 years of human infrastructure and agriculture have developed is somehow a good thing is professional 'not the white guy saying this for once' Vijay Jayaraj, with another of his op-eds for the fossil fueled CO2 Coalition . In the Daily Caller, Jayraj's op-ed headline proclaims "" Climate change transformed India into an agricultural superpower – just ask my grandparents .""

Jayaraj does not, of course, actually prove that. Instead, he gives credit where it's due, Norman Borlaug's green revolution, before then saying that the massive industrialization process ""was helped by moderate increases in both temperatures and CO2 levels.""

Jayaraj then goes on to cite NASA and the UN about the limited, narrow and specific benefits of warming or CO2 levels on plants, ignoring the larger ""what about the costs?"" question in precisely the way Deming and Rummo claim alarmists do about the benefits.

But in doing so, and laying out where official sources do very much acknowledge and calculate the precise ""benefits"" of warming and CO2 levels on plant life, Jayaraj manages to disprove his fellow deniers' assertions that people simply ignore those facts. Deniers only know about that science, because of the very scientific institutions they're accusing of covering up those facts!"

What’s the Ultimate Goal of ‘Climate Change’ and COVID Lies?

Commentary

The minute they switched “global warming” to “climate change,” you knew they were lying.

Well, you knew it if you cared about the concept formerly known as “science.” You knew that you were being manipulated and lied to through the promulgation of new code words that would be used to obfuscate.

What was going on was obvious. They meant “global warming,” unless it was inconvenient, unless there was suddenly “global cooling.” Then, it was “climate change.” Nevertheless, it would still be humanity’s fault—your fault.

That was also a not-so-subtle salvo against “freedom of speech,” without which real science can’t exist.

Timeout for some real science, in case you missed it:

“A new study, ‘Corrupted Climate Stations: The Official U.S. Surface Temperature Record Remains Fatally Flawed,’ finds approximately 96 percent of U.S. temperature stations used to measure climate change fail to meet what the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) considers to be ‘acceptable’ and uncorrupted placement by its own published standards.”

Interesting, no? You should read it all.

And yet “climate change” (warming, in English) marches on as if it were indisputable, even if it had and has myriad fallacies, not just the one from The Heartland Institute research in the above paragraph. Greenpeace founder Patrick Moore has demonstrated this thoroughly.

Although “climate” scores near the bottom of voter concern in polling, the necessary brainwashing (mass formation psychosis, if you will) has already been completed.

You can see the results in energy policies that are currently destroying Europe and, only to a slightly lesser extent, our country. California is already on “flex plans,” its leaders drunk on the reactionary chimera of electric cars that benefit only China for its monopoly on rare earths, not to mention solar panels.

“Be Green or You’re Mean!” might as well be the slogan of our reactionary left, but think what that did and does to actual scientific inquiry.

It did, however, prepare the ground for what happened with COVID-19, creating obedient, sheep-like masses ready to follow the prescriptions of Drs. Fauci, Birx, and others, as radically inconsistent and often nonsensical as they were.

An uneducated public in the sciences didn’t help. The same could be said of most politicians who were also, for the most part, similarly uneducated and already bought by Big Pharma and Big Tech anyway, no matter what pronouncements the pols made for public consumption. Their actions weren’t much, if they existed at all.

Meanwhile, our hospitals and their treatments were under federal government diktats that largely funded them—ditto scientific research as we learned years ago, when climate scientists altered their data to please their government benefactors.

Climate change, COVID … where is this all headed, this seemingly deliberate dumbing down of science and, therefore, the public, rendering us devoid of personal agency?

Is depopulation the ultimate goal?

What could be more cynical? Only Ian Fleming could have dreamed this up because only Bond villains are so monstrous and yet, what other conclusion can we come to?

Will Social Security and pension plans—in all countries, not just ours—be worth anything as the population decreases? They depend on increases to survive. These so-called elitists have been plotting global impoverishment and, with that, depopulation, starting with “climate change” and probably before.

I’m not sure how we counter this, but anyone supporting the globalists must be voted out. That, of course, includes their clueless supporters in the Democratic Party who, in many cases—believe it or not, because it’s right in front of our noses—seem unaware of what’s happening.

The world of Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and the other Bond villains must be stopped.

United Nations Secretary General António Guterres has urged the world to unite against climate change during a visit to Pakistan, where devastating floods have killed nearly 1400 people.

“This is the time to mobilise the efforts of everybody against the climate change,” Mr Guterres said at a press conference in Islamabad with Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.

“We are heading into a disaster. We have waged a war on nature and the nature is striking back in a devastating way — today in Pakistan, tomorrow in any of your countries,” he said.

“We need to stop an increase in emissions and start reducing them now.”

Mr Guterres urged the world to rally in support of Pakistan, a country he said was on the frontline in the global war against the impact of climate change, despite not contributing much to carbon omission.

“It is absolutely essential that this is recognised by the international community, especially by those countries that have more contributed to the climate change,” the UN chief said.

The unprecedented floods, triggered by heavy monsoon rains in June, have killed 1391 people, a third of them children, and inundated an area larger than Britain.

At least 33 million people have been affected by the floods, which most observers said came as a result of climate change, and Pakistani officials said pose an existential threat to the country.

“There is no memory of anything similar to what has happened with this impact of climate change on Pakistan,” Mr Guterres said.

Pakistan’s Finance Ministry estimated the losses to the country’s economy at $US30 billion ($44 billion). UN agencies last week said millions of people, including vulnerable women and children, needed urgent humanitarian assistance.

“The numbers are appalling but beyond the numbers I see the families,” Mr Guterres said. “They have lost their loved ones, houses, crops and jobs and they are living in a desperate condition.”

The UN last week launched an emergency global appeal to raise $US161 million ($235 million) to fund the immediate response to the catastrophe.

Mr Guterres will visit the worst-hit southern province of Sindh on Saturday. Many cities and towns there are still inundated.

Sharif said the visit would help Pakistan secure more global aid to rebuild."

The Treasury Department will warn the White House that cryptocurrencies could pose significant financial risks that outweigh their benefits unless the government rolls out major new regulations, according to two people familiar with the matter. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Through four separate reports this month, Treasury is expected to make clear that the Biden administration’s top economic officials believe crypto needs strong oversight, as lawmakers weigh new rules for the digital assets.

Treasury’s reports will highlight the economic danger of cryptocurrencies in several key areas, including the fraud risks they pose for investors, the two people familiar with the matter said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the reports before they’re public. Treasury’s assessments conclude that cryptocurrencies do not yet pose a stability risk to the broader financial system — but that the situation could change rapidly.

One of the reports will focus in particular on the financial hazards posed by stablecoins, a form of cryptocurrency that is in theory pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar, the people said. Treasury last fall called on Congress to give banking regulators new authority to police those digital tokens, but lawmakers have yet to reach agreement on how to do so. Meanwhile, the collapse of a $60 billion stablecoin project called Terra this spring helped accelerate a broader crypto market downturn that’s ongoing.

Lawmakers are considering forcing the government to write federal rules for the industry, as crypto interests have poured money into a lobbying campaign to shape the debate. The sector is pushing to establish the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as its primary regulator, believing it is friendlier than the Securities and Exchange Commission would be. So far, the industry appears to be winning: Three bipartisan bills introduced this year all codify a leading role for the CFTC.

It was not immediately clear how Treasury would weigh in on that question — or others that are dividing crypto interests and consumer and investor advocates. A Treasury spokesman declined to comment.

“Treasury is trying to create the analytical basis for very strong oversight of this sector of finance,” one of the people familiar with the matter said. “They’re also hoping that with this kind of report, it becomes hard to have regulations that back off of tough oversight of the industry. This framework would serve as a benchmark, to say ‘Let’s be focused on these risks and not be carried away with the technology and industry promises.’ ”

The reports are responding to an executive order that President Biden signed in March for a comprehensive review of the federal government’s approach to digital assets, from their environmental impact to their potential for promoting financial inclusion. At the time, industry leaders said they were encouraged by the development, framing it as an acknowledgment of the sector’s staying power by the most powerful voice in Washington.

Yet Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen has been a frequent skeptic of crypto, despite taking pains to stress that it could result in meaningful new innovations. Her department recently drew First Amendment complaints from the industry when it imposed sanctions on a crypto-anonymizing program known as Tornado Cash, a preferred tool of North Korean hackers. Treasury officials’ push for new requirements also complicated a bipartisan House effort to enact a new oversight regime for stablecoins, according to a CoinDesk report earlier this month.

Mark Hays, who specializes in crypto issues for Americans for Financial Reform, a left-leaning group, said Treasury officials have met with a range of groups, including his, about the upcoming reports. Hays cited Federal Trade Commission data showing that $1 of every $4 reported lost to fraud was paid in cryptocurrency. Consumers have reported more than $1 billion lost to crypto from January 2021 to March 2022, Hays said, citing the FTC data.

“We mostly see a predatory model similar to what we saw in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis,” Hays said. “We hope the report finds a way to communicate the scale and severity of that potential harm.”

Dave Grimaldi, head of government affairs for the Blockchain Association, an industry lobbying group, praised the administration for ordering the review. “Doing a scan of the entire federal government to find out where jurisdiction lies for a new technology with major consumer impact is [a] smart process,” he said. “The White House understands the winds of change are blowing toward decentralized payment systems and away from traditional and institutional finance as we know it.”

Tyler Gellasch, president and CEO of the investor advocacy organization Healthy Markets, said he is skeptical the report will propose a tough approach.

“Many crypto industry practices are simply illegal in the securities markets, so avoiding the SEC’s rules is essential to the crypto industry’s bottom lines,” he said. “If the report recommends giving the CFTC new authority over spot trading in digital assets, as many expect, we don’t expect see public celebrations, but there would still be a huge sighs of relief from K Street to Silicon Valley to China.”

e312e6fd-9a3e-4fe3-bbd0-1ae6c7dc7a5d,"“Crisis” is an incredibly potent word, so it’s interesting to witness the way the phrase “climate crisis” has become part of the lingua franca.

Once associated only with a few “outspoken” scientists and activists, the phrase has now gone mainstream.

But what do people understand by the term “climate crisis”? And why does it matter?

The mainstreaming of crisis-talk

It’s not only activists or scientists sounding the alarm.

UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres now routinely employs dramatic phrases like “digging our own graves” when discussing climate. Bill Gates advises us to avoid “climate disaster”.

This linguistic mainstreaming marks redrawn battle lines in the “climate wars”.

Denialism is in retreat. The climate change debate now is about what is to be done and by whom?

Scientists, using the full authority of their profession, have been key to changing the discourse. The lead authors of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports now pull no punches, talking openly about mass starvation, extinctions and disasters.

Read more: An official welcome to the Anthropocene epoch – but who gets to decide it's here?

These public figures clearly hope to jolt citizens, businesses and governments into radical climate action.

But for many ordinary folks, climate change can seem remote from everyday life. It’s not a “crisis” in the immediate way the pandemic has been.

Of course, many believe climate experts have understated the problem for too long.

And yet the new ubiquity of siren terms like climate “crisis”, “emergency”, “disaster”, “breakdown” and “calamity” does not guarantee any shared, let alone credible, understanding of their possible meaning.

This matters because such terms tend to polarise.

Few now doubt the reality of climate change. But how we describe its implications can easily repeat earlier stand-offs between “believers” and “sceptics”; “realists’ and ""scare-mongerers”. The result is yet more political inertia and gridlock.

We will need to do better.

Four ideas for a new way forward

Terms like “climate crisis” are here to stay. But scientists, teachers and politicians need to be savvy. A keen awareness of what other people may think when they hear us shout “crisis!” can lead to better communication.

Here are four ideas to keep in mind.

1. We must challenge dystopian and salvation narratives

A crisis is when things fall apart. We see news reports of crises daily – floods in Pakistan, economic collapse in Sri Lanka, famine in parts of Africa.

But “climate crisis” signifies something that feels beyond the range of ordinary experience, especially to the wealthy. People quickly reach for culturally available ideas to fill the vacuum.

One is the notion of an all-encompassing societal break down, where only a few survive. Cormac McCarthy’s bleak book The Road is one example.

Central to many apocalyptic narratives is the idea technology and a few brave people (usually men) can save the day in the nick of time, as in films like Interstellar.

The problem, of course, is these (often fanciful) depictions aren’t suitable ways to interpret what climate scientists have been warning people about. The world is far more complicated.

2. We must bring the climate crisis home and make it present now

Even if they’re willing to acknowledge it as a looming crisis, many think climate change impacts will be predominantly felt elsewhere or in the distant future.

The disappearance of Tuvalu as sea levels rise is an existential crisis for its citizens but may seem a remote, albeit tragic, problem to people in Chicago, Oslo or Cape Town.

But the recent floods in eastern Australia and the heatwave in Europe allow a powerful point to be made: no place is immune from extreme weather as the planet heats up.

There won’t be a one-size-fits-all global climate crisis as per many Hollywood movies. Instead, people must understand global warming will trigger myriad local-to-regional scale crises.

Many will be on the doorstep, many will last for years or decades. Most will be made worse if we don’t act now. Getting people to understand this is crucial.

3. We must explain: a crisis in relation to what?

The climate wars showed us value disputes get transposed into arguments about scientific evidence and its interpretation.

A crisis occurs when events are judged in light of certain values, such as people’s right to adequate food, healthcare and shelter.

Pronouncements of crisis need to explain the values that underpin judgements about unacceptable risk, harm and loss.

Historians, philosophers, legal scholars and others help us to think clearly about our values and what exactly we mean when we say “crisis”.

4. We must appreciate other crises and challenges matter more to many people

Some are tempted to occupy the moral high ground and imply the climate crisis is so grand as to eclipse all others. This is understandable but imprudent.

It’s important to respect other perspectives and negotiate a way forward. Consider, for example, the way author Bjørn Lomborg has questioned the climate emergency by arguing it’s not the main threat.

Lomborg was widely pilloried. But his arguments resonated with many. We may disagree with him, but his views are not irrational.

We must seek to understand how and why this kind of argument makes sense to so many people.

Words matter. It’s vital terms like “crisis” and “calamity” don’t become rhetorical devices devoid of real content as we argue about what climate action to take.

In the midst of a physical and political crisis sparked by rising food and fuel prices, Pakistan has also been attempting to secure additional funds from the International Monetary Fund to stay afloat, packages that come with mandates to enact painful “structural reforms” like making obscenely expensive energy even more expensive. While Americans have been pleasantly surprised to find their dollars at parity with the Euro while vacationing along the Amalfi Coast, the rupee and other basket currencies in poorer countries have hit historic lows against the dollar. As flood damage in Pakistan continued to mount—now estimated to be “far greater” than $10 billion—the IMF approved another loan worth $1.1 billion for the country last week.

Debt burdens limit countries’ ability to respond when disaster strikes, let alone make investments to adapt to extreme weather or mitigate their own emissions. Still, some 80 percent of the paltry climate finance on offer from richer countries to do all these things has come in the form of loans, further adding to climate-vulnerable countries’ debt burdens. There’s been scant climate finance on offer at all, though, as historical emitters like the U.S. continue to brush off concrete conversations about financing for “loss and damage” (recovery) during U.N. climate talks. Whether acknowledged or not, the IMF is now a major provider of climate finance by default.

This all sets up a vicious cycle. Economies now paying even more to service their dollar-denominated debts will, understandably, turn to whatever quick forms of revenue are on offer. For many places—including Argentina—that means exploiting oil and gas reserves, especially now as producers can fetch high prices for exports to Europe. But a climate crisis driven by the burning of those same fossil fuels is wreaking havoc in the countries digging them up; the World Bank has found that floods and droughts have cost Argentina between $500 million and $1.4 billion in annual losses, a figure that could increase by 125 percent as temperatures rise. The situation is worse still for poorer countries. El Salvador, Ghana, and Bangladesh all face serious risks of default, following Sri Lanka’s default last spring. Economic crises are also helping to fuel dangerous political crises, including Salvadoran dictator and bitcoin enthusiast Nayib Bukele’s ballooning police state."

9413fc54-d296-48b5-a73d-6b30e956f71b,"This is an extract from Humanity’s Moment: A Climate Scientist’s Case for Hope by Joëlle Gergis, available now.

Perhaps the most heavily criticised outcome of COP26 was not only that the current pledges are still insufficient, but the fact that they still include plans to burn fossil fuels well past what is possible to limit warming to 1.5°C above pre-­industrial levels. The IPCC report clearly states that we know we need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% between now and 2030 to keep this goal within reach.

The 2021 Global Carbon Budget report estimates that the world has around a decade of burning carbon at the current rate if humanity hopes to avoid catastrophic warming. Despite draft text in the Glasgow Climate Pact including a clause about “accelerating efforts towards the phase out of unabated coal power and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies”, members failed to agree on a “phase out” of coal use, following last-­minute objections by India and China that succeeded in watering down the language to a far weaker “phase down”.

Nonetheless, despite the compromised phrasing, it is important to note that it was the first time that a United Nations climate change declaration directly mentioned the need to rapidly reduce the use of fossil fuels, something that nations like Saudi Arabia and others have stripped out in the past. The international community has now very clearly signalled to financial markets that the fossil fuel era is coming to an end.

While acknowledging the critical diplomatic significance of the achievement, we are dealing with an emergency situation where actions must speak louder than words. Clearly there is still a real disconnect between the political response to climate change and the scientific reality we face. While it was very positive to see major powers like the United States and the United Kingdom bring significant commitments to reduce emissions this decade, other countries either did not increase their ambition at all, or only did so in a negligible way.

For example, China, now the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter, responsible for around a third of global emissions, only agreed to increase its use of renewable energy to 25% by 2030, up from its previous pledge of 20%. While its Nationally Determined Contribution submission mentions the phase out of coal and its intention to stop building new coal-­fired power projects overseas, it also stated “it is unlikely to fundamentally change the coal-­dominated energy mix in the short term” and did not formally sign up to the clean energy transition statement.

Further evidence that political leaders aren’t quite ready to give up fossil fuels was also obvious from an effort to phase out oil and gas production, which only received limited support on the sidelines of the summit. Despite the dominant role of oil and gas in fuelling climate change, the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance garnered just 12 members, including Denmark, Costa Rica and France.

The IPCC report very clearly states that the large-­scale burning of fossil fuels is the primary cause of climate change. Virtually all of the observed global warming we have experienced so far has been driven by emissions from human activities. According to the 2021 Global Carbon Budget report, between 1960 and 2020, around 82% of carbon dioxide emissions came from the burning of fossil fuels, with the remaining 18% generated from land ­use changes like deforestation and the degradation of ecosystems.

Total anthropogenic emissions more than doubled over the past 60 years, with almost half of the carbon dioxide accumulated in the atmosphere emitted since 1990. The burning of coal was the largest contributor to these emissions, closely followed by oil and gas. As the latest IPCC assessment highlighted, greenhouse gas concentrations are now at their highest levels in at least 2 million years, leading to rates of warming unprecedented in thousands of years, with no sign of slowing down.

Despite the Glasgow Climate Pact stating that it “expresses alarm and utmost concern that human activities have caused around 1.1°C of warming to date”, the science is very clearly telling us we are still nowhere near doing enough to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. So what exactly is going on?

In a nutshell, there is still entrenched reluctance in many parts of the world to phase out coal, oil and gas. Without genuine commitments to eliminate the burning of fossil fuels — the factor responsible for the lion’s share of the problem we face — we will lock in dangerous levels of climate change. Scientifically speaking, it is as simple as that. But when you consider things politically, things become much more complex.

According to the International Monetary Fund, in 2020 governments spent US$450 billion in direct subsidies to the fossil fuel industry — four and a half times more than developed countries are willing to spend on financing climate change adaptation in vulnerable regions. Instead, nations like Australia, the United States and China are basing their policies on unproven, highly subsidised carbon capture and storage technology rather than investing in renewable energy solutions that exist today.

Most alarmingly, plans to continue to expand the fossil fuel industry are still underway — the United Kingdom currently has at least 40 new projects in the pipeline, including plans to develop the controversial Cambo offshore oilfield in the North Sea. In the United States, President Joe Biden’s administration’s call for a pause on new oil and gas leases on federal land and water was blocked in the federal court after 14 state governments, including Louisiana and Texas, legally challenged the move.

As of November 2021, Australia had 72 new coal projects and 44 new gas projects under development, including the exploration of the new Beetaloo and Canning gas basins in northern Australia, which are being heavily supported by government subsidies. These projects would more than double Australia’s gas and coal production, resulting in 1.7 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases each year, equivalent to more than 200 coal-­fired power stations, or twice the emissions of global aviation.

And this only includes projects currently under development, not prospective projects where no publicly available information exists to estimate the impact of their emissions. This colossal expansion of the fossil fuel industry is entirely inconsistent with the nation’s stated target of achieving net-­zero emissions by 2050.

While it is clear that the fossil fuel industry still heavily influences governments the world over, signs of resistance are emerging. One of the positive developments to come out of COP26 was an agreement to phase out coal-­fired electricity in the 2030s for major economies and the 2040s for developing nations. While 40 countries, including the United Kingdom and Germany, signed the pledge, the world’s biggest coal-­dependent economies of the United States, China, India and Australia are missing from the deal.

Similarly, another agreement to end all overseas finance for “unabated” fossil fuel projects — those run without carbon capture and storage — by the end of 2022 was only formally signed by 31 governments and financial institutions, including the United Kingdom, United States and Canada. Significantly, neither statement was signed by China, Japan, India or Australia, some of the world’s largest fossil fuel emitters and exporters.

This reflects the fact that our political leaders are still protecting corporate interests that intend to keep the fossil fuel industry on life support until the bitter end. Without genuine commitments to phase out the burning of fossil fuels, we are not serious about addressing climate change. The simple truth is that unless we consign coal, oil and gas to history, we will destabilise our climate and reconfigure life on the planet as we know it.

The most confronting aspect of COP26 was the overwhelming presence of fossil fuel lobbyists representing major oil and gas companies like Shell and British Petroleum. More than 500 people with links to the fossil fuel industry attended, contributing to at least 27 country delegations including Australia, Canada and Russia. Together, they were the largest delegation present at the COP26 summit — more than any single country present at the meeting — far outnumbering the delegations from countries that are worst affected by climate change. According to Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, Pacific Island negotiators were outnumbered by fossil fuel representatives by more than 12 to one.

To me as a climate scientist, the presence of hundreds of people openly promoting the continued expansion of the fossil fuel industry alongside people literally being displaced from their homes felt completely immoral. How can a climate summit pleading for world leaders to urgently avert planetary disaster be crawling with fossil fuel lobbyists? It’s like the tobacco industry showing up to a lung cancer conference to promote their products. It’s easy to feel demoralised by the fact that our political leadership is failing us. In the face of such insidious forces, is there anything any of us can ever really do to turn this around?

In the days following COP26, I thought long and hard about the leadership failure we witnessed at Glasgow. Like many people, I started to feel cynical and despairing about what unfolded. Hollow promises in the face of a global emergency; the cruelty of greed; the sting of knowing you’ve missed the moment. Ugandan youth climate activist Vanessa Nakate clearly summed up the implications of inaction, saying: “You cannot adapt to lost cultures, you cannot adapt to lost traditions, you cannot adapt to lost history, you cannot adapt to starvation. You cannot adapt to extinction.” Addressing protesters gathered in Glasgow, she told the crowd: “Leaders rarely have the courage to lead. It takes citizens, people like you and me, to rise up and demand action. And when we do that in great enough numbers, our leaders will move.”

And then something finally clicked. I realised that human history is an endless tug of war for social justice: a struggle between those wanting to maintain the status quo that protects the interests of a few, and others who fight for equality for all. This struggle has been part of every great victory in our history. From the abolition of slavery to the fight for women’s rights, people have stood up against injustice and said enough is enough.

Yes, our political leaders collectively failed us at Glasgow, but in the pavilions and out on the streets, leadership of another kind was also there thriving — our Indigenous leaders, innovators, young people, entrepreneurs, our environmentalists, scientists, artists, activists — visionaries of every stripe, rising to the biggest challenge humanity has ever faced, in any way that they could.

Despite the travel restrictions posed by a deadly pandemic, people gathered from every corner of the world to be part of this critical moment in human history. A colourful procession of 100,000 demonstrators filled the streets of Glasgow to demand more action inside the negotiation rooms. But this was just one part of the Global Day of Action for Climate Justice events that took place on November 6, 2021 in more than 100 countries around the world, from Kenya to Canada, China to Brazil, Norway to Australia. And that’s when it hit me — we are witnessing the biggest social movement of our time. A time of true global citizenry, driven by our passion to save the one thing that sustains us all: our Earth.

At the COP26 opening ceremony, Kenyan climate activist Elizabeth Wathuti powerfully reminded us of our shared humanity, asking world leaders to: “Please open your hearts. If you allow yourself to feel it, the heartbreak and the injustice is hard to bear.” In times of crisis, we don’t look into each other’s eyes and see our differences; we recognise our shared humanity. We feel each other’s pain, and do whatever we can to ease each other’s suffering. We care about injustice and about righting the wrongs of the past. We understand that we need to be the type of person that strives to be compassionate, loving and kind.

When our moral compass tells us that we have lost our way, we let our heart guide us back to what feels right and true. When we align our values with our actions, we are unstoppable. The force for good has the power to change the course of history; it always has, and it always will. Right now, we need to recognise that collectively we have the power to change our political leadership, wherever we find ourselves in the world. Every battle won is a step closer to winning the war."
842e9efd-990f-47af-9df8-22fbb9ae2974,"A New Lake Has Formed in Pakistan Amid a ‘Monsoon on Steroids’

A third of Pakistan is covered in floodwaters as the country suffers a devastating monsoon season. An inland lake seems to be forming around the southern Sindh province, satellite images show, while an existing lake has swelled dramatically.

Images taken by NASA’s MODIS satellite sensor in late August show the overflowing Indus River and an inland lake forming. They reveal the stark differences in Pakistan between August 2021 and August 2022.

This year’s chaotic monsoon rains have also affected Lake Manchar, Pakistan’s largest freshwater lake. It has overflowed several times, which has put about 100,000 residents in the path of more floodwater, according to the NASA Earth Observatory. The lake is just west of the Indus River in the Sindh province, which has seen more than five times its average rainfall this year. Images obtained by the Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 satellites show the differences in the overflowing lake on June 25, August 28, and September 5.

More than 30 million people across the country have been affected by the floods. About half a million people have been displaced and nearly 1,200 people have died, NBC News reports. Major roads and highways are unusable and some bridges have been washed away, making it harder for some to evacuate badly affected areas, the AP reports. This has also made it harder for emergency services to reach those in need, especially villagers whose homes have been completely washed away. People have begun setting up camp on roadsides and in abandoned buildings near their sunken homes in the hopes that they can eventually return, according to a release from the UN Refugee Agency.

Monsoon season, which is a regularly occurring rainy season in the tropics, usually begins in June and continues until the end of September throughout Pakistan. Communities there know to expect this, but climate change has messed with the intensity. Warmer air holds more moisture, and extreme rainfall events are occurring more frequently. Some monsoon seasons are also occurring earlier or shifting when they begin and end, giving people in those areas little time to adjust and prepare. This leads to more displacement and death, especially for poorer communities with limited resources.

“The Pakistani people are facing a monsoon on steroids — the relentless impact of epochal levels of rain and flooding,” UN Secretary General António Guterres said last week in response to this year’s destructive season."

As many as 33 million of a population of 220 million have been affected in a disaster blamed on climate change that has left hundreds of thousands homeless and caused losses of at least $US10 billion ($A14.8 billion), officials estimate.

""You wouldn't believe the scale of destruction there,"" Sharif told media after a visit to the southern province of Sindh. ""It is water everywhere as far as you could see. It is just like a sea.""

The government, which has boosted cash handouts for flood victims, will buy 200,000 tents to house displaced families, he added.

Receding waters threaten a new challenge in the form of water-borne infectious diseases, Sharif said.

""We will need trillions of rupees to cope with this calamity.""

The United Nations has called for $US160 million in aid to help the flood victims.

Many of those affected are from Sindh, where Pakistan's largest freshwater lake is dangerously close to bursting its banks, even after having been breached in an operation that displaced 100,000 people.

National disaster officials said eight children were among the dead in the last 24 hours. The floods were brought by record monsoon rains and glacier melt in Pakistan's northern mountains.

With more rain expected in the coming month, the situation could worsen further, a top official of the United Nations' refugee agency (UNHCR) has warned.

Already, the World Health Organization has said more than 6.4 million people need humanitarian support in the flooded areas.

The raging waters have swept away 1.6 million houses, 5735 km of transport links, 750,000 head of livestock, and swamped more than 2 million acres of farmland.

Pakistan has received nearly 190 per cent more rain than the 30-year average in July and August, totalling 391mm, with Sindh getting 466 per cent more rain than the average."
5147193c-107b-4963-8437-78443bf18c4a,"Climate change is beset with unpleasant surprises1. Yields of maize (corn), wheat, rice and soya beans all fall precipitously when temperatures exceed certain thresholds — for example, 29 °C for maize2. These four staple crops together account for 75% of the calories consumed by humans3, so the non-linear temperature dependence of their yields calls for rapid action to avoid the tipping points, either by limiting the carbon dioxide emissions that are warming the planet4 or by relocating crop fields on a vast scale — probably both. But efforts to curb global warming rely increasingly on the use of plant biomass to reduce emissions, and introduce a feedback loop that endangers attempts to meet essential climate goals, as Xu et al.5 report in a paper in Nature.

Read the paper: Delayed use of bioenergy crops might threaten climate and food security

Plants absorb CO 2 from the atmosphere during photosynthesis, and this process can be used to capture and store CO 2 when fuels made from plant biomass are burnt without releasing the CO 2 back into the atmosphere; this results in a source of energy that has ‘negative’ emissions. Most models that estimate the costs associated with a changing climate assume that this technology, known as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), will be ramped up substantially over the coming decades6,7. And with good reason — an increase in the deployment of new, improved technologies is typically a safe assumption. However, Xu and colleagues’ analysis shows that, as time goes by and the world warms, falling crop productivity rates will reduce the effectiveness of BECCS, highlighting limits of this new technology.

The authors describe the effect as a ‘positive’ feedback loop. There is, of course, nothing positive about this particular feedback in the conventional sense of the term: increased global average warming leads to reduced crop yields, which, in turn, decreases carbon capture through BECCS, inducing further increases in global average warming. In this scenario, two negative links combine to create one hot mess.

Climate–economy modelling has undergone a substantial shift over the past decade, as researchers have warmed to the idea that these models can include large quantities of bioenergy5,6. The Energy Modeling Forum (EMF) was established in 1976 at Stanford University in California to tackle issues associated with energy and the environment. In 2009, most of the 10 models used by the forum (then in its 22nd iteration) suggested that atmospheric CO 2 concentrations could not be kept below 450 parts per million8 — a threshold that is expected to induce global average warming of around 2 °C above pre-industrial levels9. This prediction was all the more troubling because the models included ambitious assumptions, such as that the global price for CO 2 emissions would reach as much as US$1,000 in 2012. And, in spite of such assumptions, the world still seemed to lack the mitigation potential in mitigation efforts to cut CO 2 emissions to safe levels.

Net-zero commitments could limit warming to below 2 °C

The 33rd iteration of the EMF in 2020 included these same models, albeit with some key changes. Crucial advances in technologies such as solar cells and battery storage had brought down the costs associated with reducing CO 2 emissions. This meant that many more cuts in emissions could be made than those previously planned — and sooner4. The EMF’s updated models also assumed that there would be a higher potential for bioenergy around the globe than that predicted in 2009, especially in the latter half of the twenty-first century10. Xu and colleagues’ study is a timely warning that this assumption should not be relied on to meet emissions targets.

Recognizing the effect of land-use changes on global warming is essential for effective mitigation strategies11. But the realization that BECCS and other negative-emissions technologies have a profound impact on the environment, and therefore on global warming, seems to have come only in the past few years12. The theoretical potential of a given technology is too often determined by its technical limits alone, with little regard for its political and socio-economic limits. In the case of BECCS, the many competing interests for limited land — with food chief among them — impose severe constraints on the likelihood that it can be scaled up as much as is sometimes assumed.

The political and socio-economic obstacles currently standing in the way of BECCS have often led climate modellers to assume that the mitigation potential will increase in the future, when the present constraints are lifted. But Xu and co-authors’ analysis suggests that this optimism could be thwarted by the dependence of crop yields on temperature, and that of BECCS on biomass production, two relationships that together form a feedback loop set to exacerbate climate change. And timing is a crucial factor: the longer we wait before implementing BECCS on a large scale, the more negative will be the impact of climate on crop yields — worsening climate change still further (Fig. 1).

Figure 1 | Crop yields could affect global-warming mitigation. Climate–economy models assume that strategies for curbing global warming must involve increased deployment of technology known as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). However, Xu et al.5 found that the effectiveness of BECCS is likely to be influenced by the temperature sensitivity of crop productivity rates, which is typically highly non-linear. The authors’ analysis suggests that the timing of widespread implementation of BECCS will be key to its climate impact. (Adapted from Fig. S8 of ref. 5.)

The interaction of timing with non-linear threshold effects is not limited to the relationship between BECCS, crop yields and temperature. Indeed, it is a broader phenomenon that highlights the need for prudence when dealing with climatic tipping points13,14. The danger of crossing uncertain tipping points raises the estimated cost of future damage caused by emitting CO 2 and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Negative tipping points should thus prompt us to hasten the uptake of ambitious mitigation measures.

The existence of positive socio-economic tipping points, such as the rapid spread of charging stations for electric vehicles or deployment of heat pumps, could be just as crucial15,16. Mitigation technologies can seem both expensive and improbable until they are suddenly ubiquitous. Somewhat counter-intuitively, these positive non-linearities, too, provide an incentive for climate-mitigation action that is more ambitious and more rapid than that occurring without them17,18. One reason is that locking in existing ‘dirty’ technologies increases the cost of transitioning to cleaner alternatives later, whereas rapid changes incentivize further action.

Something similar could apply to BECCS. Increasing investments in BECCS sooner than currently planned will no doubt limit warming and boost crop productivity. But it could also lead to technological improvements that lessen the negative impacts of BECCS on food security and other competing land uses. This expectation should, however, be treated with caution. Although improvements to maize farming have been under way for decades, the rate of growth of US maize yields started to slow from exponential to linear in the 1980s, perhaps owing to binding biophysical constraints that are difficult to overcome19.

Political constraints could be even more relevant than biophysical factors. Land and other natural resources are in limited supply, and land-use decisions can quickly prove to be unpopular with voters. Simply imagining that these political hurdles will be overcome in a distant future, well beyond current election cycles, will not make it so.

Much like the prospect of distant technological salvation from climate change, the expected future effectiveness of BECCS must not detract from the need to cut emissions now20. Xu et al. have offered further evidence that relying on technological breakthroughs down the line is a fraught endeavour. As their analysis demonstrates convincingly, waiting for salvation could well hasten our demise, because delays might restrict the technologies available to us now."

Climate change is putting the availability of biomass fuels and technologies—a vital alternative to fossil fuels—at risk, according to new research.

The study has found that as temperatures rise, the window of opportunity to maximize the use of biomass from plants, wood and waste as a renewable energy source and an alternative to petrochemicals is closing.

Published in Nature and led by researchers at the universities of York and Fudan in China, the study investigated the sustainability of biomass exploitation.

The researchers found that if urgent action is not taken to reduce fossil fuels in favor of bioenergy and other renewables, climate change will decrease crop yields, reducing the availability of biomass feedstocks. Reducing food production is also likely to incentivize cropland expansion, increasing greenhouse gas emissions from land use change and further accelerating the rate of climate change, the researchers say.

Co-author of the paper, Professor James Clark from the Department of Chemistry, said, ""Biomass fuels and feedstocks offer a renewable source of energy and a viable alternative to petrochemicals, but the results of our study act as a stark warning about how climate change will put their availability at risk if we continue to allow global temperatures to rise.

""There is a tipping point where climate change will severely impede our ability to mitigate against its worst effects. Biomass with carbon capture and storage including the manufacture of bio-based chemicals must be used now if we are to maximize its advantage.""

In the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and in many assessments of climate mitigation, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) has been highlighted as a crucial element of the strategy for meeting the target of 2 degrees Celsius or 1.5 degrees Celsius warming set out in the Paris Agreement.

The researchers used global data to model the responses of crop yields to rising average temperatures, atmospheric CO 2 concentration, nitrogen fertilization intensity and precipitation. They found that if a switch to BECCS is delayed to the second half of this century, biomass production would be largely reduced by climate change, resulting in a failure to achieve the 2 degrees Celsius goal and jeopardizing global food security.

For example, when BECCS is delayed from 2040 to 2060, the researchers found reduced yields of agricultural residue for biomass technologies would decrease the capacity of BECCS and increase global warming from 1.7 to 3.7 degrees Celsius by 2200, with a decline in global average daily crop calories per capita from 2.1 million calories to 1.5 million calories.

The researchers calculate that in this scenario the scale of the food trade would need to increase by 80% from 2019 levels in order to avoid severe food shortages in many parts of the developing world worst affected by climate change.

Professor Clark added, ""If negative-carbon mitigation technologies relying on biomass could be widely deployed in the short term, there is still hope that we can alleviate global warming and a global food crisis.""

309535eb-c015-4188-bac4-7daec8d1a345,"Natural disasters, including catastrophic flooding in NSW and Queensland, cost each Australian household an average of more than $1500 last financial year, insurers say, as the industry presses for more public investment in mitigation.

This year’s flooding in northern NSW and Queensland was the second-most costly natural disaster in the country’s history, with almost $5.3 billion in insured losses, and new research commissioned by the Insurance Council of Australia (ICA) highlights the wider economic costs of extreme weather.

The research, by think tank the McKell Institute, says the floods demonstrate how extreme weather is not only economically damaging to communities directly hit by disasters, but it can also affect many more people indirectly, such as through inflation.

Published on Thursday, the research pointed out that the floods helped to drive inflation sharply higher because of hefty agricultural losses. It said fruit and vegetable price inflation was 5.8 per cent in the June quarter, compared with 1.8 per cent for all goods and services, and the agricultural losses caused by floods were a key reason for the price surge."

c5800293-b3c9-4029-bf28-394374d9028c,"Deadly floods and natural disasters this year have cost each Australian household $1532, a new report has found.

The hefty sum per household went to taxes, insurance costs, uninsured damage and increased prices due to supply chain shortages.

The authors of The Cost of Extreme Weather report released on Thursday by the Insurance Council of Australia (ICA) and the McKell Institute say that figure is set to balloon to $2509 per household by 2050 if no structural changes are made.

""Australia is a nation on the frontline of climate impacts,"" the report said.

""As climate change worsens, we must focus more on resilience.""

The 29-page report found federal money spent on post-disaster relief dwarfs that spent on planning and mitigating inevitable natural disaster events.

Since 2005, federal spending on disaster relief was $24 billion while spending on disaster resilience was just $500 million.

The February-March floods in northern NSW and western Sydney became the second costliest extreme weather event in modern Australian history estimated to be around $5.28 billion with over 230,000 claims lodged.

The average incurred loss for residents of Lismore, the epicentre of the devastating floods which claimed 13 lives overall, was $20,000.

McKell Institute CEO Michael Buckland said costs of extreme weather events had gone beyond those directly affected to impacting every Australian immediately.

""The 2022 floods ... not only impacted millions of people and cost more than $5 billion in insurance damages, but they also showed that even individuals who were not directly impacted by the event bear the economic and social cost.""

The ICA said it was high time state and federal government worked more in concert to make insurance affordable for victims and build developments that withstand extreme weather events.

""States and territories must also do their bit ... to protect communities from worsening extreme weather,"" said the council's CEO Andrew Hall.

""They should also act now to reform state taxes on insurance products as an immediate measure to make insurance more affordable and lift the level of cover against extreme weather events.""

Under changes proposed by the federal government Australia will have a dedicated and ongoing funding source for natural disaster resilience and risk reduction projects.

A proposal for the new disaster ready fund, previously known as the emergency response fund, was introduced to federal parliament by Home Affairs Minister Clare O'Neil on Wednesday.

The government will provide $200 million each year for the fund and will review the allocation sum at least every five years.

The fund would focus on building resilience for future natural disasters and delivers on a Labor election commitment, Ms O'Neil said."

Climate change stresses Kim Kardashian out — and she wants everyone to know that no one, even megastars who take 10-minute trips on private jets, can be “100% perfect” when it comes to climate activism.

In a cover interview with Interview Magazine that hit newsstands Wednesday, the megastar talks about her plant-based diet, her activism on behalf of the unjustly convicted, and Pete Davidson; she also gets asked about climate change. Let’s take a look at what Kim thinks about the rapid heat death of our planet.

INTERVIEW: Global warming. It is actually insane. There are fires in the south of France, the tarmac is melting in England. Do you feel like you do anything to combat and prevent that? I don’t think I do that much, to be honest, and I’m curious what your thoughts are? KARDASHIAN: I believe in climate change, and I believe that anything can help. But I also believe in being realistic and I think sometimes there’s so much to worry about on this planet, and it can be really scary to live your life with anxiety. I have super climate change-involved friends, and I love learning from them. I do what I can, but you have to pick and choose what really works for you in your life. OTTENBERG: Yeah. KARDASHIAN: No one’s going to be 100 per cent perfect.

Whew! Let’s unpack that.

On the surface, Kim’s words are very true. No one is going to be 100% perfect about climate change. Like the man in the Mister Gotcha comic, those of us who are concerned about climate change are trapped in a system created and perpetuated by capitalism, where our individual choices mean next to nothing compared to the big fixes we need. It is pointless to live a life dominated by climate anxiety; we’re all faced with the monumental task of figuring out how to balance our trepidation about impending disasters and our drive for change with the realities that we must continue to exist in.

But hearing one of the most famous women in the world, who has a net worth of $US1.8 ($2) billion, complain that worrying about climate change simply does not “work” in her life is pretty infuriating. As I wrote last month when Taylor Swift was getting dragged for her private jet use, there’s a fine line between acknowledging that climate change is a systemic problem that requires systemic solutions and excusing incredibly wasteful individual behaviours. The habits of ultra-rich people like Kim Kardashian aren’t normal and aren’t compatible with a climate-safe future with equality and justice for everyone. We don’t need to apply a forgiving, mental-health-adjacent framework to someone who is able to hire private firefighters when wildfires threaten her neighbourhood.

And the Kardashians have plenty of climate crimes to be feeling guilty about. Kim and sister Kylie have both shown off new private jets over the past few months. In July, Kim’s jet took a 10-minute trip between two suburbs of Los Angeles — a trip that emitted a full ton of CO2. According to the US EPA emissions calculator, that’s the equivalent of driving a passenger car for more than 3,621 km, nearly the same distance as a cross-country trip from South Carolina to California.

Kim and the rest of her family were recently dinged for excessive water use during a drought by Los Angeles water regulators: in June, Kim’s house used 878,215 l more than its limit, while her sister Kourtney’s property went over by 382,326 l. Kim’s excess water use works out to more than 29,148 l per day; the normal American household uses around 1,136 l of water per day. Given California’s extreme, ongoing, climate change-fuelled drought, there are definitely better uses for all that water than whatever Kim is choosing to spray it on.

All these wasteful behaviours may seem like normal life to the ultra-rich, but they’re gobbling up an outsize amount of the world’s resources. The systemic changes we need will never work if individual behaviours don’t also change, and easy fixes like dialling back the excessive waste of the super wealthy are some of the lowest-hanging fruit we can find.

Kim, if you’re reading this: You should be more anxious."
b1f25103-34b0-40b3-993f-db25a09731ef,"Kim Kardashian has too much on her plate to constantly be worried about climate change. The only way she’s been able to make room for it in her schedule has been to compartmentalize by toggling between acknowledging its irreversible impact and simply pretending not to see it. “I do what I can,” she shared in a recent American Dream-themed conversation with Interview Magazine. “But you have to pick and choose what really works for you in your life.”

Kardashian shared that she’s been learning a lot from her friends tapped in with new climate change developments, but she also believes there are bigger fish to fry. “I believe in climate change, and I believe that anything can help,” she added. “But I also believe in being realistic and I think sometimes there’s so much to worry about on this planet, and it can be really scary to live your life with anxiety.”

In the patriotic photoshoot accompanying the interview, Kardashian sports all the staples of American fashion: from denim and leather to an American flag bikini and, well, her own ass. “As I told you, a jockstrap is just a frame for a great butt,” Interview editor-in-chief Mel Ottenberg tells her.

And nothing captures the American Dream quite like keeping your eye on the prize, even if that means turning a blind eye or two to the surrounding chaos.

In her self-tailored climate change approach, Kardashian is picking her watered lawn and massive residential pools while choosing to ignore the excess of her water usage during another Southern California drought.

Last month, it was reported that Kardashian and her sister Khloe had been issued “notices of exceedance” by the Las Virgenes Municipal Water District for their combined usage of 333,000 gallons of water over the set limit for the district serving Agoura Hills, Calabasas, Hidden Hills, and Westlake Village, according to public data obtained by The Los Angeles Times. Her Hidden Hills residence used 232,000 excess gallons of water in June alone.

Appearing alongside her sister Kylie Jenner, Kardashian was also listed on a newly published list by the sustainability marketing firm Yard, which gathered data to rank the celebrities whose private jets have dumped the most carbon dioxide into the atmosphere so far this year. While her numbers weren’t nearly as bad as Taylor Swift’s (who created estimated total flight emissions of 8,293.54 tonnes of carbon across 170 flights), Kardashian racked up 4268.5 tonnes across 57 flights.

She does make a fair point that you can only do what you can on an individual level to address a pressing concern being exacerbated by grand corporate entities and a lack of government initiative, but opting out of using soggy paper straws doesn’t really match up to taking dozens of trips on private jets or using enough water to fill half of an Olympic-sized swimming pool."

'But I think my talent is marketing and the business behind selling products and knowing what the customer wants and making it feel attainable, but also a bit unattainable at the same time.

Kim Kardashian has said that while she “believes in climate change”, she has to be “realistic” about what she worries over.

The Kardashians star, who purchased a US$150m (approximately £130m) private jet earlier this year, said that when it comes to climate change, “I do what I can” but added that no one is “100 per cent perfect”.

In a new interview with Interview magazine, published on Tuesday (6 September), the 41-year-old business mogul was asked about whether she feels she takes action to “combat and prevent” global warming.

Kardashian replied: “I believe in climate change, and I believe that anything can help. But I also believe in being realistic and I think sometimes there’s so much to worry about on this planet, and it can be really scary to live your life with anxiety.”

Adding that she has “super climate change-involved friends” who she “love[s] learning from”, her advice to the public is to “pick and choose what really works for you in your life”.

“No one’s going to be 100 per cent perfect,” Kardashian said.

The SKIMS mogul showed off her new private jet in an episode of The Kardashians in June. The aircraft, which she dubbed “Kim Air”, features custom cashmere furnishings and luxury accommodations.

Members of the Kardashian-Jenner family have faced criticism for their frequent use of private jets to travel around the US and the world.

In July, Kylie Jenner received backlash for bragging about her and Travis Scott’s two private jets while parts of the US and Western Europe struggled to cope with a record-breaking heatwave.

Jenner, 25, was dubbed a “climate criminal” after it was revealed that her jet had been used for trips as short as three minutes. It is unclear if Jenner was in the aircraft for the micro-journey.

Studies have shown that private jets have a disproportionately large impact on the environment, with a single jet able to emit two tonnes of CO2 in just one hour.

According to European clean transport group Transport & Environment, the wealthiest one per cent of the population are responsible for around 50 per cent of global aviation emissions."

Celebrities and public figures have faced backlash for their contribution to climate change through their extravagant lifestyles while promoting climate change charities.

People criticized the reality TV show star for 'picking and choosing' ways to live her life in relation to climate change, especially given recent controversy surrounding celebrities using private planes.

Kardashian's half-sister, Kylie Jenner, particularly faced backlash for bragging about her private jet while the UK faced an unprecedented heat wave this summer.

d0fde0cb-a8fd-4d4d-8ff2-52ca059aaa75,"If bleaching the eyebrows of conventionally attractive celebrities in an attempt to make them a little less conventionally attractive feels like a fashion editorial decision that’s distinctly 2016, then a celebrity with a $150 million private jet purporting to care about climate change is quite simply timeless. Not only is it timeless, it’s the American way.

In a new Interview magazine cover story, Kim Kardashian does, in fact, “bare all,” as its headline promises: news of a forthcoming true crime podcast (the first season follows “a guy who got the death sentence for a triple homicide that happened in Ohio”), her glamour goals (“look tight forever”), and what exactly her talents are (“I can cook well, use my toes for anything”). However, the mogul shows her whole ass when asked about the evolving, enduring climate catastrophe known as planet earth.

“I believe in climate change, and I believe that anything can help,” she told Mel Ottenberg, the magazine’s editor-in-chief. “But I also believe in being realistic and I think sometimes there’s so much to worry about on this planet, and it can be really scary to live your life with anxiety.”

“I do what I can, but you have to pick and choose what really works for you in your life,” she continued. “No one’s going to be 100 percent perfect.”

Kardashian also fretted over the overturning of Roe v. Wade—despite her May endorsement of billionaire Rick Caruso, the mall magnate running for mayor of Los Angeles, who has donated nearly $1 million to anti-abortion politicians. “If a court can decide what a woman does with her body, then it also puts having children through surrogacy, and things that I have been through, in jeopardy,” she told Interview, unsurprisingly twisting the question to make the loss of abortion rights about her rarefied lifestyle. “I always believed people should live their lives exactly how they want to, so it’s really scary to see all of this happening.”

Presumably to distract from how truly dispassionate her answers sound, Kardashian pulled out her decades-old party trick to go with the interview: flashing her actual ass. This time, she’s trussed up by what appears to be a jock strap, with an American flag in the background—as if to say, “go on and kiss it,” to anyone who’s rightfully pointed out that Kardashian is one of many millionaires who should probably just stop speaking about politics—especially climate change—in public.

Lest anyone forget, Kardashian—and seemingly anyone that shares some of her DNA—has the harmful habit of setting off in her $150-million, cashmere-lined jet at a moment’s notice. She’s recently gotten flak for flouting mandatory water restrictions amidst an unprecedented drought in Los Angeles. It should also be noted that h er beloved Caruso—of whom she said, “I really believe in what he stands for” in her Instagram endorsement—has absolutely no plan for addressing climate change or combating climate injustice.



There’s plenty to disagree with Kardashian about, but perennial climate dread isn’t one of them. Unlike the masses however, she just gets to pick and choose when to feel it. And what could be more like the American Dream than that?

The only thing bigger than Kim Kardashian’s cultural footprint is her carbon one.

The reality TV star has long been known globally, but more recently she’s sparked backlash for her planet-destroying behavior, including wasting water during a drought emergency and dumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every time she flies private.

And yet Kardashian insisted that she’s doing her part to fight climate change in a recent chat with Interview Magazine, for which she wore a jockstrap on the butt-baring cover.

“I believe in climate change, and I believe that anything can help,” she told the outlet in a story published Tuesday. “But I also believe in being realistic and I think sometimes there’s so much to worry about on this planet, and it can be really scary to live your life with anxiety.”

The Skims founder said that she loves “learning” about the issue from her “super climate change–involved friends.” (Presumably that does not include activist Greta Thunberg, Kardashian’s one-time dream dinner guest.)

“I do what I can, but you have to pick and choose what really works for you in your life,” she added. “No one’s going to be 100 percent perfect.”

What “really works” for Kardashian, however, isn’t great for the environment.

Last month, the Los Angeles Times revealed that the media mogul could be among the biggest water wasters in an ongoing drought in California.

The Las Virgenes Municipal Water District issued “notices of exceedance” to Kardashian for surpassing 150% of her monthly water budget multiple times, with her Hidden Hills home and its adjacent lot using 232,000 gallons in June alone.

The controversy arrived on the heels of Kardashian also sparking backlash over her air travel. Alongside sister Kylie Jenner, she ranked high on a list of celebrities with the most private jet emissions in 2022. By July, Kardashian’s 57 flights — the shortest of which lasted a mere 23 minutes — had reportedly emitted about 610 times more carbon than the average person does in a year."

Kardashian continued, “I have super climate change-involved friends, and I love learning from them. I do what I can, but you have to pick and choose what really works for you in your life.”

“So far this year, Kim’s jet emitted 4268.5 tonnes of carbon emissions over 57 flights: 609.8 times more than the average person emits in a year,” read the firm’s findings, which were published on July 29. “Kim’s jet has an average flight time of 85.49 minutes, for an average journey length of 99.78 miles.”

While the KKW Beauty creator hasn’t specifically commented on the report, her sister Khloé Kardashian couldn’t help but joke about the situation — reacting to a post that claimed their mom, Kris Jenner, had something to do with Taylor Swift’s own ranking on the list.

The “London Boy” singer, 32, was named Yard’s worst “celebrity offender” with 170 private jet flights since January, spending approximately 22,923 minutes in the air. Though a spokesperson for Swift quickly claimed to E! that “Taylor’s jet is loaned out regularly to other individuals” and that “most or all of these trips” weren’t actually taken by her, social media users wasted no time in roasting her — and all of the celebs in the ranking.

For her part, Kim was ranked No. 5 on the list, while Travis Scott — Kylie Jenner’s boyfriend and father of her two children — came in at No. 10, with his private jet emitting “3033.3 tonnes of CO2” since January, Yard’s report stated at the time."

The notice indicates that she had exceeded 150% of her monthly water budget at least four times since the district declared a drought emergency at the end of 2021, per the Times.

Representatives for Kardashian did not respond to the Times' or Insider's requests for comment at the time of the report.

Kardashian also ranked at No. 7 on a list of celebrities with the highest private-jet carbon-dioxide emissions, according to a report from the UK-based sustainability marketing firm Yard."

Kim Kardashian has said that while she “believes in climate change”, she has to be “realistic” about what she worries over.

The Kardashians star, who purchased a US$150m (approximately £130m) private jet earlier this year, said that when it comes to climate change, “I do what I can” but added that no one is “100 per cent perfect”.

In a new interview with Interview magazine, published on Tuesday (6 September), the 41-year-old business mogul was asked about whether she feels she takes action to “combat and prevent” global warming.

Kardashian replied: “I believe in climate change, and I believe that anything can help. But I also believe in being realistic and I think sometimes there’s so much to worry about on this planet, and it can be really scary to live your life with anxiety.”

Adding that she has “super climate change-involved friends” who she “love[s] learning from”, her advice to the public is to “pick and choose what really works for you in your life”.

“No one’s going to be 100 per cent perfect,” Kardashian said.

The SKIMS mogul showed off her new private jet in an episode of The Kardashians in June. The aircraft, which she dubbed “Kim Air”, features custom cashmere furnishings and luxury accommodations.

Members of the Kardashian-Jenner family have faced criticism for their frequent use of private jets to travel around the US and the world.

In July, Kylie Jenner received backlash for bragging about her and Travis Scott’s two private jets while parts of the US and Western Europe struggled to cope with a record-breaking heatwave.

Jenner, 25, was dubbed a “climate criminal” after it was revealed that her jet had been used for trips as short as three minutes. It is unclear if Jenner was in the aircraft for the micro-journey.

Studies have shown that private jets have a disproportionately large impact on the environment, with a single jet able to emit two tonnes of CO2 in just one hour.

According to European clean transport group Transport & Environment, the wealthiest one per cent of the population are responsible for around 50 per cent of global aviation emissions.

af2e57d6-3bc9-43cd-b08e-f7bf16192f0b,"MOMBASA, Kenya — Rich countries said they will spend about $25 billion by 2025 to boost Africa’s efforts to adapt to climate change as the continent continues to struggle with drought, cyclones and extreme heat, according to officials at a summit in Rotterdam in the Netherlands on Monday.

The amount promised by the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program – a joint initiative between various nations and organizations – is billed as the largest ever adaptation effort globally. Half of the amount is pledged by the African Development Bank with representatives from Denmark, the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, the International Monetary Fund and others also offering their support for the initiative.

The continent emits just 3 percent to 4 percent of emissions despite being home to nearly 17 percent of the world’s population but experts say it is particularly vulnerable to climate change as it less able to adapt. African nations hope to use the funds to improve their resilience to extreme weather events, such as droughts or floods, increase tree cover and protect biodiversity, as well as expand their renewable energy capacity.

The summit comes just weeks after the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development found that rich countries had failed to deliver on their 2009 promise to spend $100 billion a year to aid developing countries to adapt to a warming climate. The organization said $83.3 billion was given to poorer nations in 2020, the highest ever sum, but still short of the original amount.

If the funds promised at the Rotterdam summit are delivered, the decades-old goal will finally be achieved but African nations warn this will not be enough.

“Africa does not have the resources to tackle climate change,” Akinwumi Adesina, president of the African Development Bank, told the summit. “The continent only receives 3 percent of the total climate financing.”

Africa will need between $1.3 and $1.6 trillion this decade to implement its commitments to the Paris climate agreement, an annual cost between $140 and $300 billion, Adesina said. He added that the costs of adapting to climate change are expected to increase by 2050, as the effects of global warming get more severe.

Ghana’s President Nana Akufo Addo said his country will push for the funds allocated to adapting to a warmer climate to be doubled at the forthcoming United Nations summit in Egypt in November.

After decades of developed countries falling short on their funding promises, many African nations remain skeptical that the funds will ever reach the continent.

The U.N. Climate Change High-Level Champion for Egypt, Mahmoud Mohieldin, said the existing global climate financing structure is “insufficient and ineffective,” especially for Africa.

The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) on Monday reported the cumulative number of fatalities since June 14 has risen to 1,314, with 458 victims being children.

The southern eastern region of Sindh remains the worst affected with total of 522 deaths, including 219 children, reported so far.

About 33 million people have been displaced by the floods with the spread of deadly waterborne diseases now looming as many remain without adequate shelter or food.

UNICEF estimates about 16 million children are impacted and 3.4 million are in dire need of humanitarian aid with the risk of ""many more child deaths"" ahead of winter.

""There is now a high risk of water-borne, deadly diseases spreading rapidly -- diarrhoea, cholera, dengue, malaria,"" it said in a statement.

""Without adequate sanitation, communities are increasingly having to resort to open defecation, putting them at high-risk of contracting diseases.

""The situation will only continue to deteriorate as winter is just eight weeks away in some parts of the country.""

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday renewed an appeal for humanitarian aid following a visit to the flood-ravaged area of Shahdadkot in Sindh province.

""As Pakistan battles one of the worst climate-induced calamities, among the most adversely affected are children,"" he tweeted.

""With over 400 dead, they make up one third of overall death toll. Now they are at even greater risk of water-borne diseases. UNICEF and other global agencies should help.""

The United Nations has called for $160 million in aid, however, Finance Minister Miftah Ismail estimates the total damage bill exceeds more than $10 billion.

""Clearly it is not enough. In spite of meagre resources Pakistan will have to do much of the heavy lifting,"" he told CNBC news on Monday.

Record monsoon rains and melting glaciers sparked unprecedented flooding which has now left one third of the country underwater.

The deluge followed a summer of record-breaking heatwaves and higher than average rainfall.

Two UNHCR planes touched down on Tuesday in the southern port city of Karachi and two more were expected later in the day. A third plane, with aid from Turkmenistan also landed in Karachi. While the floods in recent weeks have touched much of Pakistan, the southern Sindh province, where Karachi is the capital, has been the most affected.

More than 1300 people have been killed and millions have lost their homes in flooding caused by unusually heavy monsoon rains in Pakistan this year that many experts have blamed on climate change.

In response to the unfolding disaster, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres last week called on the world to stop ""sleepwalking"" through the crisis. He plans to visit flood-hit areas on September 9.

On Sunday, engineers cut into an embankment in the sides of Lake Manchar to release rising floodwater to save the city of Sehwan and several nearby villages from possible destruction by flooding waters, which have damaged 1.6 million houses since mid-June.

Floods have affected more than 3.3 million in this Islamic nation of 220 million and the devastation has caused $US10 billion ($A15 billion) in damage, according to government estimates. The majority of people killed were women and children.

Last week, the United States announced $US30 million ($A44 million) in aid for Pakistani flood victims. On Monday, two members of Congress met with Pakistani officials and visited some of the stricken areas, the government said.

Flood waters were receding in Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Baluchistan provinces, but the situation was alarming across Sindh province. Hundreds were leaving the district of Jaffarabad after their homes were flooded.

More than 420,000 Afghan refugees are estimated to be in the worst-affected areas in Pakistan, living side by side with their host communities.

Planes carrying aid from other countries are also expected in response to an appeal from Sharif, who has appealed to the international community to help Pakistan.

With the two UNHCR planes, 38 planes have brought in aid from countries including China, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Uzbekistan."

The most heartbreaking aspect of this situation is that while climate change impacts the entire world, Pakistan currently faces a crisis bigger than any other country despite having contributed very little to global carbon emissions.

""We consistently see climate devastation in the forms of floods, monsoons, extensive droughts, extreme heat waves,"" Pakistan Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said in an interview with CNN Tuesday. ""And frankly, the people of Pakistan, the citizens of Pakistan, are paying the price in their lives, their livelihoods for the industrialization of rich countries that has resulted in this climate change.""

According to the Global Climate Risk Index, Pakistan is responsible for less than 1% of the world's planet-warming gases. Despite this, it is the eighth most vulnerable nation to the climate crisis due to its significant number of glaciers.

According to The Washington Post, Pakistan is home to over 7,200 glaciers, more than any other country. As a result of rising temperatures due to climate change, these glaciers are likely to melt faster and earlier, as a result adding water to rivers and streams that are already swollen by rainfall.

“We have the largest number of glaciers outside the polar region, and this affects us,” Rehman told the Associated Press. “Instead of keeping their majesty and preserving them for posterity and nature,” she said, “we are seeing them melt.”

In addition to injuries and death, about 1 million homes and about 2,200 miles of roads have been destroyed. As of Tuesday, nearly 500,000 people are in displacement camps, and many others have nowhere to go, The Washington Post reported.

""More than three million children are in need of humanitarian assistance and at increased risk of waterborne diseases, drowning and malnutrition due to the most severe flooding in Pakistan's recent history,"" the UN children's agency warned, according to CNN. The World Health Organization said that more than 6.4 million people were in dire need of humanitarian aid.

By Thursday, officials in Pakistan noted an outbreak of waterborne diseases in areas hit by the flooding. According to ABC News, diarrhea, skin diseases, and eye infections are among the diseases spreading at relief camps set up by the government across the country. The outlet noted that over 90,000 diarrhea cases were reported from one of the worst-hit provinces, Sindh, in the past 24 hours, according to a report released by the health officials.

Farah Naureen, the director for Pakistan at the international aid agency Mercy Corps, told the Associated Press that waterborne diseases were increasing at a faster pace among displaced people in flood-hit areas due to a lack of resources. Pregnant women especially are facing the brunt of this crisis in addition to women and girls already being at an increased risk of gender-based violence.

“Around 73,000 will be giving birth within the next month, and they need skilled birth attendants, privacy, and birth facilities, or the survival of the mother and the newborn will be at risk,” Naureen said.

Several nonprofits are working to provide temporary housing, food, and health supplies to victims of the natural disaster.

“Our team has been fielding messages from villages in Interior Sindh. They’ve spent days in the areas to understand what is needed most and who are those that need us most. Many of these communities are home to nomadic tribes who travel between areas often. Vans full of volunteers have dispersed to various villages with food relief bags,” said Uzma Bawany, founder of Thaakat Foundation, a nonprofit with global sites, including one in Pakistan.

“We are so grateful to those supporting our efforts and to all nonprofits and people on the ground giving it everything they’ve got.”

Thaakat gave permission to Daily Kos to use photos from its social media to depict the work volunteers are doing and the condition survivors of the flooding are in."

With rivers breaking their banks, flash flooding and glacial lakes bursting, Pakistan is experiencing its worst floods this century. At least one-third of the country is under water, some 33 million people have been displaced and more than 1,200 have died. Scientists say several factors have contributed to the extreme event, starting with phenomenal heatwaves and a longer, stronger monsoon.

At first glance, it doesn’t look like much: just a handful of bright pixels. But the James Webb Space Telescope’s first image of an exoplanet demonstrates the observatory's infrared prowess. Exoplanets are difficult to image directly because they are often lost in the glare of the star around which they orbit. Observing in infrared wavelengths, as Webb does, helps boost the contrast between star and planet. “It gives us wavelengths we’ve never seen planets at before,” says astronomer Beth Biller.

BRUSSELS, Sept 7 (Reuters) - The European Union and China are questioning each other's commitment to fighting climate change, following the failure of climate talks by the Group of 20 (G20) last week.

At the end of last week's negotiations in Bali, Indonesia, the 20 governments failed to agree a joint communique on climate change. Diplomatic sources had said some countries, including China, were unhappy with language that had already been agreed and enshrined in past deals. read more

The EU's climate change chief on Monday accused ""the biggest emitter on this planet"" – a reference to China – of attempting to backtrack on the Glasgow Climate Pact, which capped two weeks of U.N. negotiations in November.

""Some of the very, very big players on this planet are trying to roll back from what they had agreed in Glasgow,"" Frans Timmermans told a meeting in Rotterdam on climate adaptation in Africa.

""And some of them, even the biggest emitter on this planet, try and hide behind developing countries in using arguments that I think, at some point, are no longer viable,"" said Timmermans, who is executive vice president of the European Commission.

China is responsible for about 30% of annual emissions, making it the world's biggest emitter today while the United States is second and the EU third. The United States, however, is the biggest emitter historically.

China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs rebuffed the accusation, and said Beijing demanded an ""accurate"" interpretation of past climate deals.

The 2015 Paris Agreement, for example, committed wealthy countries – whose emissions are largely responsible for global warming – to cutting carbon dioxide emissions fastest while also supporting developing countries in following suit. Under the Paris deal, China is defined as a developing country.

""As a developing country itself, China has always stood by the vast number of developing countries and firmly safeguarded their common interests,"" a spokesperson from the Chinese ministry said.

The failure by rich nations to deliver promised climate finance has raised tensions in global climate negotiations. The 27-country EU is the biggest provider of climate finance, according to OECD data.

China has pledged to peak emissions by 2030 – a target which could see its emissions increase in the near term as it opens new coal plants. Beijing has resisted calls from Europe to revise this goal to cut emissions faster.

The Foreign Affairs Ministry said China's low-carbon transition remained ""firm"", and pointed to European countries burning more coal as they race to replace Russian gas.

""The green and low-carbon process is now encountering countercurrents,"" the ministry said, referring to European coal use.

European policymakers have said the uptick in coal is a temporary measure, and will not thwart climate targets. The EU has fixed into law its target to cut net emissions 55% by 2030, from 1990 levels.

daa942a2-4d90-4e26-a704-ed8a933ccf35,"Hawai’i shuttered its last remaining coal-fired power plant last week, bidding farewell to a carbon-intensive energy source that the island chain has relied on for more than 150 years.

The now-retired power plant, owned by the power generation company AES, had been operating since 1992 on the island of Oahu, home to the state capital of Honolulu. It provided up to 20 percent of the Oahu’s electricity and also emitted some 1.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide each year.

“Today marks a major milestone in Hawai’i’s clean energy transition,” Scott Glenn, Hawai’i’s chief energy officer, said in a statement.

Hawai’ian policymakers approved legislation in 2020 to phase out coal-fired power generation by the end of 2022, coinciding with the end of a 30-year contract for the AES Hawai’i coal plant in Oahu. That legislation built on previous climate commitments, including the nation’s first state law — passed in 2015 — mandating 100 percent renewable electricity generation by 2045. Since then, more than 20 other states and the District of Columbia have followed suit with similar clean-energy pledges.

Cutting coal will also help Hawai’i get to carbon neutrality by 2045, as mandated by a 2018 law. In 2017, the most recent year for which state data is available, Hawai’i produced 20.56 million metric tons of greenhouse gases, roughly 86 percent of which came from the energy sector.

The challenge now is ensuring Hawai’i has enough renewable capacity to keep up with its energy needs. AES, which supports the transition away from coal and has even helped its former coal plant workers find new jobs in renewable energy, says it’s working on six renewable energy projects across the Hawai’ian islands. Statewide, regulators have approved at least nine other solar, battery, or geothermal projects that are set to begin operating by 2024.

One solar and battery project on Oahu, called Mililani I Solar, was completed at the end of July and has been providing up to 39 megawatts of clean energy at peak times — about one-fifth the capacity of the now-retired coal plant. Miliani I also includes 156 megawatt-hours of battery capacity, allowing energy to be stored and deployed at night, when the sun isn’t shining.

Although Hawai’ian renewables are on the rise, state officials say they still can’t provide enough electricity to fully supplant fossil fuels. Hawai’i is the U.S.’s most petroleum-dependent state, and Hawaiian Electric, the state’s largest electricity supplier, predicts that some coal-fired power generation will have to be replaced with oil — at least in the near term. That replacement is expected to cause a 7 percent bump in Hawai’ians’ electricity bills, which are already some of the highest in the country.

In an interview with the Guardian, Glenn called the state’s continued oil reliance “really unfortunate” but stressed that it would only be temporary and that the move away from coal would pay dividends in the longer term. “[P]hasing out fossil fuels in favor of our own renewable resources will provide more cost stability and predictability,” he added in his statement. “[W]e will be more energy independent and show the world that every action counts.”"
ef9765c5-276e-4d1b-80ae-9886b69d5853,"Weeks of catastrophic flooding in Pakistan, triggered by climate change-driven erratic monsoon rains, have raised fears of acute food shortages and further spread of waterborne deadly diseases in the country of about 220 million people.



Pakistani officials estimate a third of the South Asian nation, an area the size of the United Kingdom, has been left underwater by the flooding, destroying almost half of its croplands.



The United Nations said Friday that the torrential rains ""have broken a century-long record,"" dumping more than five times the 30-year average for rainfall in some provinces.



This has caused widespread flooding and landslides, with severe repercussions for human lives, property and infrastructure, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.



""Initial estimates on the ground suggest that at least 3.6 million acres of crops/orchards across the country have already been affected. The livestock sector has also experienced severe losses, with over 733,000 livestock reportedly killed,"" it said.



Since mid-June, when seasonal rains began, more than 1,200 people have been killed, including 416 children, and at least 6,000 others have been injured. More than 1.1 million houses have been washed away or damaged, and 33 million residents in 80 hardest-hit districts will require some form of assistance, according to Pakistani officials.



Nearly 500,000 people are in relief camps, while many more are displaced and being hosted by other households.



The Pakistan military said Friday that its rescue teams had evacuated an additional 2,000 people from calamity-hit districts, bringing to 50,000 the total number of individuals moved to safer locations since rescue operations began.



Southwestern Baluchistan, southern Sindh and parts of central Punjab provinces have been badly hit by the floods.



The U.N. Population Fund says at least 650,000 pregnant women and girls, 73,000 of whom are expected to deliver in the next month, are among the victims. It says many of the women lack access to health care facilities and support they need to deliver their children safely.



""Most births in Pakistan happen at home, and with almost 1 million homes destroyed, many women don't know where they will deliver their babies,"" Human Rights Watch said Friday.

""Pakistan's disastrous floods highlight not only how the effects of the climate crisis are unevenly shared geographically, but also the disproportionate impact on women and girls,"" the group said.



Fears of more child deaths



Abdullah Fadil, the Pakistan representative of the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF), said Friday that at least 18,000 schools had been damaged or destroyed in the floods, which have affected an estimated 16 million children, including 3.4 million who need humanitarian support.



""Many children are now at heightened risk, without a home, school or even safe drinking water,"" Fadil said. ""There is therefore a risk of many more child deaths. And the situation will only continue to deteriorate as winter is just eight weeks away in some parts of the country.""

He said that communities were increasingly having to resort to open defecation without adequate sanitation, putting them at high risk of contracting diseases such as diarrhea, cholera, dengue and malaria.



Pakistani and U.N. officials said relief and rescue operations were still hard to conduct, noting that more than 5,000 kilometers of roads and 243 bridges had been damaged or destroyed by floodwaters.



""Yet lifesaving rescue and relief efforts are indispensable, and UNICEF is distributing humanitarian supplies in all affected provinces,"" Fadil said. The supplies include drinking water; hygiene kits; medicines; water purification tablets; vaccines; therapeutic food for children, pregnant and lactating women; and mosquito nets.

""The sad reality is, as we have seen all around the world, climate change is making extreme weather events more frequent and more destructive, and it is children who are too often paying the price.""

Fadil noted that Pakistan ranks 14th out of 163 countries on UNICEF's Children's Climate Risk Index, placing the country in the ""extremely high risk"" category in the index.



'Monsoon on steroids'



The U.N. has appealed for $160 million in aid to help tackle what it said was an ""unprecedented climate catastrophe.""



U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will arrive in Pakistan on September 9 to visit flood-hit areas.

""The Pakistani people are facing a monsoon on steroids,"" Guterres said while speaking at the launch of the U.N. flash funding appeal on Tuesday.



""Let's stop sleepwalking towards the destruction of our planet by climate change. Today, it's Pakistan. Tomorrow, it could be your country,"" he warned.



Weather officials forecast more rains and flash flooding during September, raising fears that wheat-growing famers would be unable to have their croplands free of floodwaters by early October when they undertake planting.



""If floodwaters recede by that time, sowing might be possible, but if floods continued to inundate areas in Sindh and Punjab, then it's highly likely that critical wheat shortage may occur in Pakistan,"" said Mohsin Hafeez, the country representative for the International Water Management Institute.



""Such a situation may force the [Pakistan] government to import more wheat from the global market, which will add pressure on the existing import bill."" Hafeez told VOA that global wheat prices have risen since the outbreak of the Ukraine war, and a low crop output in Pakistan would add to the financial troubles facing the cash-starved Pakistani government.

Meanwhile, more humanitarian relief flights arrived on Friday from countries such as Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. China, the United States, France, Iran, Britain, Azerbaijan, Norway and Kazakhstan are among the countries that have provided or pledged flood relief aid to Pakistan.

The U.S. military said Friday that it was sending an assessment team to Pakistan to determine what support it could offer through the U.S. Agency for International Development as part of Washington’s response to the flooding crisis.

General Michael Kurilla, head of U.S. Central Command, said in a statement that he discussed the matter by phone with Pakistan’s army chief, General Qamar Javed Bajwa, and expressed ""his condolences for the people of Pakistan."""

Indonesia's Environment Minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar had started the meeting by urging countries to cut emissions and prevent the planet from being pushed to a point ""where no future will be sustainable"".

But some countries, including China, had objected to previously agreed language in the Glasgow climate pact and past G20 agreements on efforts to limit global average temperature rises to 1.5C, an official with knowledge of the meeting said, declining to be identified because they were not authorised to speak to the media.

China's foreign ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

Another diplomatic source told Reuters there had been disagreements about language around climate and also references to the war in Ukraine.

Siti had earlier said she hoped a joint communique would be signed by the end of the day but made no mention of it in her press conference later on Wednesday.

A spokesperson for Indonesia's environment ministry was not immediately available for comment on the matter.

The G20 climate meeting, hosted by this year's chair Indonesia, comes as extreme weather events - fires, floods and heat waves - pummel several parts of the world, including unprecedented flooding in Pakistan in recent weeks that has killed at least 1000 people.

Scientists say most such extreme weather events are attributable to human-caused climate change and will only increase in severity and frequency as the globe edges closer to the warming threshold of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.

Environment officials from Australia, Brazil, India, Japan, South Korea and US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry were among those attending the talks in Bali, with more bilateral meetings expected on Thursday.

Indonesia as current G20 chair invited representatives from the African Union to join the talks for the first time, Siti said, adding that voices from all countries, regardless of their wealth and size, must be heard.

Also in attendance was Alok Sharma, president of last year's 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), who said the war in Ukraine had increased the urgency of a need to shift to renewable sources of energy.

The COP27 climate summit will be held in Egypt this November.

""The current energy crisis has demonstrated the vulnerability of countries relying on fossil fuels controlled by hostile actors,"" he said in a statement on Tuesday.

""Climate security has become synonymous with energy security and the chronic threat of climate change is not going away,"" he said."

Pakistan was already struggling when the devastating monsoon rains hit.

This year, economic and political crises have converged in the South Asian nation of more than 230 million, as food and fuel prices soared and former leader Imran Khan was forced from office.

Now its reeling with the worst floods in living memory.

Swaths of Pakistan are now underwater after experiencing the heaviest rains on record with little reprieve since mid-June. Some areas have seen five times their normal levels of monsoonal rain.

More than 1,100 people have died and 33 million people are impacted – that’s more than the population of Texas.

Torrents of water have smashed through entire villages and farmland, razing buildings and wiping out crops. Satellite images from Maxar Technologies shared with CNN show how communities have been wiped out, leaving behind little more than bare Earth and dust.

Pakistan is responsible for less than 1% of the world’s planet-warming gases, European Union data shows, yet it is the eighth most vulnerable nation to the climate crisis, according to the Global Climate Risk Index. It’s paying a hefty price, not only with lives but destroyed schools, homes and bridges.

Officials estimate the total bill will be $10 billion. The recovery could take years, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in Pakistan has said. And chances are any recovery will be interrupted by yet another disaster.

“We consistently see climate devastation in the forms of floods, monsoons, extensive droughts, extreme heat waves,” Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said in an interview with CNN’s Eleni Giokos on Tuesday.

“And frankly, the people of Pakistan, the citizens of Pakistan, are paying the price in their lives, their livelihoods for the industrialization of rich countries that has resulted in this climate change.”

The stark inequity of the climate crisis, which is bearing down hardest on nations that have historically had the least to do with causing it, is raising questions over who should pay for it, particularly for the damage that countries like Pakistan are coming to terms with.

The United Nations issued an appeal for $160 million in emergency funds on Tuesday, barely enough to scratch the surface of the $10 billion needed. Countries from the United States to Turkey are pitching in with aid, rescue helicopters, food and medical supplies. Yet the need is greater than what the world is giving.

These devastating scenes and eye-watering recovery costs are what the climate crisis looks like at 1.2 degrees Celsius of global warming since industrialization.

But the world is on track for warming of more than 2 degrees Celsius, analyses show, and scientists warn every fraction of a degree of warming will worsen the impacts of the crisis.

Fahad Saeed, a climate scientist with the group Climate Analytics, who is based in Islamabad, told CNN that Pakistan was in a Catch-22 situation. The country needs money to adapt to the crisis, yet because it has to pay for the damage that extreme weather is already causing it will struggle to find the funds it needs to adjust.

“What is happening right now at 1.2 degrees centigrade of warming is not because of the poor people in Pakistan,” he said. “They are not responsible for it, and this brings out the issue of climate justice in a very clear form.”

He added that Pakistan, like so many developing nations, needed to bring more people out of poverty, a difficult thing to do in the midst of back-to-back extreme weather events with such little financial support from abroad.

Saeed said Pakistan was in “a position to present a strong case” at the COP27 international climate talks in Egypt this November that other nations should help it pay to pick up the pieces. Developed and developing nations have remained generally divided over the issue for years.

Planet Labs Planet Labs Mianwali, Pakistan Planet Labs

The developed world agreed more than a decade ago to transfer at least $100 billion a year by 2020 to developing nations to help their transitions away from fossil fuels, but also to help them adapt to climate change. That amount has never been delivered in full.

More controversial is the issue of who should pay for the destruction. At the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow, the US was one of several advanced nations that showed opposition to obligatory payments for “loss and damages” – essentially climate compensation – particularly for schemes based on historic responsibility.

Historically, the US accounts for the most greenhouse gas emissions in the world."

Flash flooding has destroyed thousands of kilometres of roads in Pakistan.Credit: Abdul Majeed/AFP/Getty

With rivers breaking their banks, flash flooding and glacial lakes bursting, Pakistan is experiencing its worst floods this century. At least two-thirds of the country’s districts have been affected. Scientists say several factors have contributed to the extreme event, which has displaced some 33 million people and killed more than 1,200.

Researchers say the catastrophe probably started with phenomenal heatwaves. In April and May, temperatures reached above 40 °C for prolonged periods in many places. On one sweltering day in May, the city of Jacobabad topped 51 °C. “These were not normal heatwaves — they were the worst in the world. We had the hottest place on Earth in Pakistan,” says Malik Amin Aslam, the country’s former minister for climate change, who is based in Islamabad.

Warmer air can hold more moisture. So meteorologists warned earlier this year that the extreme temperatures would probably result in “above normal” levels of rain during the country’s monsoon season, from July to September, says Zia Hashmi, a water-resources engineer at the Global Change Impact Studies Centre in Islamabad, speaking in his personal capacity.

Glacial melt

The intense heat also melted glaciers in the northern mountainous regions, increasing the amount of water flowing into tributaries that eventually make their way into the Indus river, says Athar Hussain, a climate scientist at COMSATS University Islamabad. The Indus is Pakistan’s largest river, and runs the length of the country from north to south, feeding towns, cities and large swathes of agricultural land along the way. It isn’t clear exactly how much excess glacial melt has flowed into rivers this year, but Hashmi visited some high-altitude glaciated regions in July and noticed high flows and muddy water in the Hunza River, which feeds into the Indus. He says the mud suggests that there has been rapid melting, because fast water picks up sediment as it moves downstream. Several glacial lakes have burst through the dams of ice that normally restrain them, releasing a dangerous rush of water.

Satellite images reveal the extent of the flooding.Credit: Copernicus Sentinel data (2022), processed by ESA (CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO)

The heatwaves also coincided with another extraordinary event — a depression, or a system of intense low air pressure, in the Arabian Sea, which brought heavy rain to Pakistan’s coastal provinces as early as June. “We rarely have large-scale depression systems arriving there,” says Hussain.

These unusual features were then exacerbated by the early arrival of the monsoon on 30 June, which “was wetter generally over a larger region for a very prolonged period of time”, says Andrew King, a climate scientist at the University of Melbourne, Australia.

The effect is that Pakistan has received almost three times its average annual rainfall for the monsoon period so far. The southern provinces of Sindh and Baluchistan have received more than five times that average. “The flooding is all over,” says Hashmi.

Once on land, much of that water has nowhere to go. More than 1.2 million houses, 5,000 kilometres of road and 240 bridges have been destroyed. In Sindh, an elongated lake has formed, tens of kilometres wide, and more water will continue to pour into it, says Aslam. “The worst is not over.”

Other factors

Some weather agencies have also predicted that the ongoing La Niña climate event — a phenomenon that is typically associated with stronger monsoon conditions in India and Pakistan — will continue until the end of the year, says King. “It’s not a super strong link, but it probably is playing a role in enhancing the rainfall.”

Human-induced global warming could also be intensifying downpours. Climate models suggest that a warmer world will contribute to more intense rainfall, says Hussain. Between 1986 and 2015, temperatures in Pakistan rose by 0.3 °C per decade — higher than the global average.

Researchers and public officials also say that other factors have probably added to the devastation, including an ineffective early-warning system for floods, poor disaster management, political instability and unregulated urban development. A lack of drainage and storage infrastructure, as well as the large number of people living in flood zones, are also implicated. “These are governance issues, but they are minuscule in relation to the level of the tragedy that we are seeing occur,” says Aslam."
d7793644-c47d-40c6-97a7-82cee412a73e,"The toll of extreme flooding on Pakistan’s food security is becoming apparent: large swathes of farmland under water, crops and food stocks washed away, homes and livelihoods wiped out.

The government warned that a food security crisis is looming. Rains and deadly floods have damaged rice and cotton crops, along with vegetables like onions and tomatoes. They also threaten wheat planting in the coming months at a time when the world can ill afford another disruption to grain supply.

Global prices of kitchen staples soared following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, driving food inflation to a record. The catastrophic flood, which is estimated to cost the economy $10 billion, is another hit to Pakistan that’s already battling an economic crisis. The damage to food supplies could boost Pakistan’s need for imports and increase the pressure on global agricultural markets.

“The agricultural sector is in turmoil. The cotton crop and vegetables are completely wiped out in many key areas,” said Ahmad Jawad, vice president of Pakistan Businesses Forum, who grows wheat, maize, citrus and sugarcane. “Wild weather just can’t give us a break. First the heat wave, now floods.”

Pakistan, among the most vulnerable globally to climate change according to the United Nations, has seen the highest rainfall in at least three decades. About a third of the country is currently flooded, the government estimates, and more than 1,100 people have lost their lives.

As much as half of Pakistan’s cotton crop has been damaged by torrential rains, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said on Tuesday, citing preliminary estimates. Pakistan is the fifth-largest cotton producer, accounting for 5% of global output. The damage could further shrink the world’s cotton supply.

Food costs have jumped in Pakistan, with tomatoes surging five times and onions tripling since last month. Steps are being taken to import vegetables and other items from Iran and Afghanistan. Pakistan is also considering a temporary land route to allow duty-free shipments from arch-rival India.

“The two neighboring countries have issues but a humanitarian crisis comes first,” Jawad said. “India has a surplus of vegetables so it’s a win-win.”

Food aid to Pakistan

International aid is also trickling in. The World Food Programme is working to expand food assistance to Pakistan, aiming to reach about half a million people in the badly-hit provinces of Balochistan and Sindh. However, distributions are hampered as floodwaters are restricting access across the country.

More than 100 bridges and about 3,000 kilometers of roads have been damaged or destroyed, almost 800,000 farm animals have perished, and two million acres of crops and orchards have been hit, according to the United Nations.

“The floods have broken multiple bridges so supplies from Iran will not reach Pakistan’s main population center in Punjab province. Indian imports are needed to help bring prices down,” Jawad said.

Pakistan already has one of the fastest inflation rates in the region, with consumer price gains rising to a 14-year high of almost 25% in July. The August print is due for release on Sept. 1.

Sowing next year’s wheat crop, which starts in October, will be another challenge. Pakistan is already in talks with Russia over importing wheat, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said last month in parliament. Even before the floods, the country was facing a wheat shortage of about 2.6 million tons.

Flash flooding from the heavy rains has washed away villages and crops as soldiers and rescue workers evacuated stranded residents to the safety of relief camps and provided food to thousands of displaced Pakistanis.

Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Authority reported the death toll since the monsoon season began earlier than normal this year – in mid- June – reached 1,061 people after new fatalities were reported across different provinces.

Sherry Rehman, a Pakistani senator and the country’s top climate official, said in a video posted on Twitter that Pakistan is experiencing a “serious climate catastrophe, one of the hardest in the decade.”

“We are at the moment at the ground zero of the front line of extreme weather events, in an unrelenting cascade of heatwaves, forest fires, flash floods, multiple glacial lake outbursts, flood events and now the monster monsoon of the decade is wreaking non-stop havoc throughout the country,” she said. The on-camera statement was retweeted by the country’s ambassador to the European Union.

Flooding from the Swat River overnight affected northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where tens of thousands of people – especially in the Charsadda and Nowshehra districts – have been evacuated from their homes to relief camps set up in government buildings. Many have also taken shelter on roadsides, said Kamran Bangash, a spokesperson for the provincial government.

Bangash said some 180,000 people have been evacuated from Charsadda and 150,000 from Nowshehra district villages.

Khaista Rehman, 55, no relation to the climate minister, took shelter with his wife and three children on the side of the Islamabad-Peshawar highway after his home in Charsadda was submerged overnight.

“Thank God we are safe now on this road quite high from the flooded area,” he said. “Our crops are gone and our home is destroyed but I am grateful to Allah that we are alive and I will restart life with my sons.”

The unprecedented monsoon season has affected all four of the country’s provinces. Nearly 300,000 homes have been destroyed, numerous roads rendered impassable and electricity outages have been widespread, affecting millions of people.

Pope Francis on Sunday said he wanted to assure his “closeness to the populations of Pakistan struck by flooding of disastrous proportions.’’ Speaking during a pilgrimage to the Italian town of L’Aquila, which was hit by a deadly earthquake in 2009, Francis said he was praying “for the many victims, for the injured and the evacuated, and so that international solidarity will be prompt and generous.”

Sherry Rehman told Turkish news outlet TRT World that by the time the rains recede, “we could well have one-fourth or one-third of Pakistan under water.”

“This is something that is a global crisis and of course we will need better planning and sustainable development on the ground. … We’ll need to have climate resilient crops as well as structures,” she said.

In May, Rehman told BBC Newshour that both the country’s north and south were witnessing extreme weather events because of rising temperatures. “So in north actually just now we are … experiencing what is known as glacial lake outburst floods which we have many of because Pakistan is home to the highest number of glaciers outside the polar region.”

The government has deployed soldiers to help civilian authorities in rescue and relief operations across the country. The Pakistani army also said in a statement it airlifted a 22 tourists trapped in a valley in the country’s north to safety.

Prime Minister Shabaz Sharif visited flooding victims in city of Jafferabad in Baluchistan. He vowed the government would provide housing to all those who lost their homes.

It said that 119 of the deaths had taken place in the preceding 24 hours.

Officials said that 226 people have been killed by flooding in the province, and the government there recently declared a state of emergency in Swat.

Over 20 million have been displaced from their homes by heavy rain, which has caused the Kabul and Indus rivers to flood, leaving large parts of Pakistan underwater.

Pakistan has never seen this level of devastation from flooding before, according to senator Sherry Rehman - who said the crisis is a direct consequence of climate change.

""It's a merciless, unrelenting, torrential monsoon - we've never seen anything like this before,"" said Rehman, who is Pakistan's climate-change minister, in a Sunday interview with the UK's Channel 4 News

""Over 146 bridges have collapsed in the country, over 3,000 kilometers of road has been cut off.""

""It's not even possible to start rebuilding while people are out there waiting for rescue,"" she added. ""We're at the ground zero of a climate dystopia.""

Rehman shared a video of flooding in Balochistan in southwestern Pakistan. Her footage showed a large stretch of land entirely submerged, with emergency helicopters struggling to find dry land.

Balochistan has been badly affected by monsoon flash flooding, with 226 people killed in the province according to officials.

Rehman also shared footage showing the Madyan bridge in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa inundated with water.

She said that the government had raised the level of the bridge by 5 meters after heavy flooding in 2010 - but that water levels are now so high it looks likely to collapse again.

Rescuers were evacuating stranded people to safer ground, including makeshift tent camps have sprung up along highways, inundated villages and towns.

Pakistani authorities backed by the military, rescuers and volunteers have been battling the aftermath of the floods that have affected more than 33 million people, or one in seven Pakistanis.

ISLAMABAD (AP) — The United Nations and Pakistan are set to appeal Tuesday for $160 million in emergency funding for nearly a half million displaced victims of record-breaking floods that have killed more than 1,150 people since mid-June, officials said.

According to initial government estimates, the devastation caused $10 billion in damage to the economy. “It is a preliminary estimate likely to be far greater,” Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal told The Associated Press.

His comment came hours before the United Nations and Pakistan were to launch an appeal in Islamabad for help.

A day earlier, the International Monetary Fund’s executive board approved the release of a much-awaited $1.17 billion for Pakistan.

Pakistan and the IMF originally signed a large bailout accord in 2019. But the release of a $1.17 billion tranche had been on hold since earlier this year, when the IMF expressed concern about Pakistan’s compliance with the deal’s terms under the government of former Prime Minister Imran Khan, who was ousted through a no-confidence vote in the parliament in April.

Last week, the United Nations in a statement said it has allocated $3 million for U.N. aid agencies and their partners in Pakistan to respond to the floods. This money will be used for health, nutrition, food security, as well as water and sanitation services in flood-affected areas, focusing on the most vulnerable.

On Monday, Climate Minister Sherry Rehman and meteorologists told the AP that new monsoons were expected in September. Monsoons have hit earlier and more heavily than usual since the start of summer, officials say — most recently with massive rains last week that affected nearly the entire country.

Pakistan is accustomed to monsoon rains and flooding, Rehman said, but not like this.

Several scientists say the record-breaking flooding in Pakistan has all the hallmarks of a catastrophe juiced by climate change, but it is too early to formally assign blame to global warming.

“This year Pakistan has received the highest rainfall in at least three decades. So far this year the rain is running at more than 780% above average levels,” said Abid Qaiyum Suleri, executive director of the Sustainable Development Policy Institute and a member of Pakistan’s Climate Change Council. “Extreme weather patterns are turning more frequent in the region and Pakistan is not an exception.”

Pakistan saw similar flooding and devastation in 2010 that killed nearly 2,000 people. But the government didn’t implement plans to prevent future flooding by preventing construction and homes in flood prone areas and river beds, said Suleri of the country’s Climate Change Council.

Floods and monsoon rains have damaged one million houses and affected 33 million people.

It reflects how poorer countries often pay the price for climate change largely caused by more industrialized nations. Since 1959, Pakistan is responsible for only 0.4% of the world’s historic CO2 emissions. The U.S. is responsible for 21.5%, China for 16.5% and the EU 15%.

According to the National Disaster Management Authority, at least 498,000 people in the country of 220 million are in relief camps after being displaced.

Many more displaced flood victims are believed to be living with relatives, friends or out in the open, without shelter.

Pakistan started receiving international aid this week, and more planes carrying aid from Turkey and the United Arab Emirates landed at an airport near Islamabad on Tuesday, according to a statement released by the military.

It said Chinese planes carrying aid will also arrive in Pakistan later Tuesday.

Pakistan has also deployed at least 6,500 soldiers to help authorities in rescue and relief operations."

The rains stopped more than two days ago, and floods in some areas were receding. But Pakistanis in many parts of the country were still wading through waters that filled their homes or covered their town’s streets as they struggled with how to deal with the damage to homes and businesses.

In one of the worst single incidents of the flooding, at least 11 people were killed Monday when a boat that volunteer rescuers were using to evacuate two dozen people capsized in the flood-swollen waters of the Indus River near the southern city of Bilawal Pur, media reported. An unknown number were still missing from the capsizing.

Climate Minister Sherry Rehman and meteorologists told The Associated Press that new monsoons were expected in September. Monsoons have hit earlier and more heavily than usual since the start of summer, officials say — most recently with massive rains last week that affected nearly the entire country.

Pakistan is accustomed to monsoon rains and flooding, Rehman said, but not like this.

“What we saw recently in the last eight weeks is unrelenting cascades of torrential rain that no monsoon has ever brought with it ever before,” she said.

The heavy rains are the latest in a series of catastrophes that Rehman said are exacerbated by climate change, including heatwaves, forest fires and glacial lake outbursts. The damage reflects how poorer countries often pay the price for climate change largely caused by more industrialized nations. Since 1959, Pakistan is responsible for only 0.4% of the world’s historic CO2 emissions. The U.S. is responsible for 21.5%, China for 16.5% and the EU 15%.

“Climate knows no borders and its effects can be disproportionately felt,” Rehman said. “When you see low pressure systems coming from the Bay of Bengal, they hit us before anyone is. So we’re on the front line of a global crisis.”

The National Disaster Management Authority said floods this summer have killed more than 1,136 people and injured 1,636 as well as damaging 1 million homes. At least 498,000 people in the country of 220 million are in relief camps after being displaced, it said. Many more displaced are believed to be living with relatives, friends or outside.

International aid was starting to flow into Pakistan, and the military was helping distribute aid to remote areas and evacuate those who had lost their homes. Authorities were starting the long effort of rebuilding roads and restarting railways. The floods destroyed more than 150 bridges and numerous roads have been washed away, making rescue operations difficult.

In the southeastern town of Shikar Pur not far from the Indus River, Rehan Ali dug up bricks from the collapsed walls of his home, nearly completely destroyed by lashing storms and waters that raged through. His family’s possessions were strewn around outside.

The 24-year-old laborer said he cannot rebuild without government help and can’t work now because of the turmoil. “I don’t even have anything to feed my family. I lost everything. I don’t know where to go. God help me,” he said.

Arif Ullah, an official at the Pakistan Meteorological Department, told the AP that more rains will continue to lash parts of Pakistan next month.

Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif on Monday said the rains so far have been the heaviest Pakistan has seen in three decades.

“I saw floodwater everywhere, wherever I went in recent days and even today,” Sharif said in the town of Charsadda in the northeast of the country. Some 180,000 people in the town have been evacuated after the Swat River overflowed and swamped nearby communities.

Sharif has said the government would provide housing to all those who lost their homes.

But many of the displaced have lost not just homes, but also crops and businesses.

“I am sitting with my family in a tent, and how can I go out to work? Even if I go out in search of a job, who will give me any job as there is water everywhere,” asked Rehmat Ullah, a flood victim in Charsadda.

Zarina Bibi said soldiers evacuated her by boat. She broke down in tears as she recounted how her house collapsed in the floods.

“We were given a tent and food by soldiers and volunteers,” she said. “Floodwater will recede soon, but we have no money to rebuild our home.”

At least 6,500 soldiers were deployed to help, and authorities said they were using military planes, helicopters, trucks and boats to evacuate people from marooned people and deliver aid to them.

However, many displaced complained they were still waiting for help. Some said they got tents but not food.

Pakistani authorities say this year’s devastation is worse than in 2010, when floods killed 1,700 people. Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, Pakistan’s military chief, said Sunday that his country may take years to recover. He appealed to Pakistanis living abroad to generously donate to the flood victims.

Cargo planes from Turkey and the United Arab Emirates began the flow of international aid, landing in Islamabad on Sunday with tents, food and other daily necessities. The United Nations will launch an international appeal for Pakistani flood victims on Tuesday in Islamabad.

The flood wreckage has hit Pakistan at a time when the country faces one of its worst economic crises, narrowly avoiding a default. Later on Monday, the International Monetary Fund’s executive board approved the release of a much-awaited $1.17 billion for Pakistan, Pakistan’s Information Minister Maryam Aurangez told the AP. The announcement was a big relief for the country.

Pakistan and the IMF originally signed the bailout accord in 2019. But the release of a $1.17 billion tranche had been on hold since earlier this year, when the IMF expressed concern about Pakistan’s compliance with the deal’s terms under former Prime Minister Imran Khan’s government.

Last week, the United Nations in a statement said that it has allocated $3 million for U.N. aid agencies and their partners in Pakistan to respond to the floods and this money will be used for health, nutrition, food security, and water and sanitation services in flood-affected areas, focusing on the most vulnerable.

Research based on satellite measurements of ice losses from Greenland and the shape of the ice cap from 2000-19 has allowed scientists to calculate how the climate crisis has pushed the ice sheet from an equilibrium where snowfall matches the ice lost.

They found that a minimum 10.6in sea-level rise is inevitable regardless of action to limit carbon emissions after 110tn tonnes of the Greenland ice cap melted. A multi-metre sea-level rise also appears likely as the trajectory of environmental damage continues.

“The minimum of 27cm is the sea-level rise deficit that we have accrued to date and it’s going to get paid out, no matter what we do going forward,” said Dr William Colgan, from the National Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (Geus). “Whether it’s coming in 100 years or 150 years, it’s coming. And the sea-level rise we are committed to is growing at present, because of the climate trajectory we’re on.”

This figure could more than double within this century. The 27cm estimate is a minimum because it only accounts for global heating so far, writes Damien Carrington, but experts said “there is still a lot of room to minimise the damage”.

More than 40% of Americans think civil war likely within decade

Civil war in the US is at least somewhat likely in the next 10 years, according to more than two-fifths of respondents to a new survey. In the poll by YouGov and the Economist, participants were asked: “Looking ahead to the next 10 years, how likely do you think it is that there will be a civil war in this country?”

Among all US citizens, 43% said civil war was at least somewhat likely. Among strong Democrats and independents that figure was 40%. But among strong Republicans, 54% said civil war was at least somewhat likely.

Most experts believe a full-scale armed conflict, like the American civil war of 1861-65, remains unlikely. But many fear an increase of jagged political division and explicitly political violence.

Senator faces backlash over violence prediction if Trump is prosecuted. The senior Republican lawmaker Lindsey Graham forecast “riots in the streets” if the former president is prosecuted for mishandling classified information after Hillary Clinton was cleared for use of her personal email, and the FBI allegedly failed to investigate Hunter Biden, Joe Biden’s son.

Oregon shooting at grocery store leaves three dead, including gunman

Pleas from the public and local senators for government leaders to take more action against gun violence have been renewed after three people, including the suspected attacker, died in a shooting at a Safeway store on Sunday night in Bend, Oregon.

Local police said one of the victims, a Safeway employee who was identified as Donald Ray Surrett Jr, 66, fought off the shooter in the produce aisle, possibly preventing more deaths. The other victim was Glenn Edward Bennett, 84.

Police said they did not fire any shots at the scene, including at the gunman, but they stopped short of immediately saying whether the gunman had killed himself. They noted that he was near an assault-style rifle and a shotgun.

What have Oregon politicians said? A number of shootings this year have involved shooters who had legally obtained assault-style rifles, and one Oregon senator said: “Assault weapons and high-capacity magazines should never be on the street in the first place.” Another added: “America cannot just shrug its shoulders.”

Payout offered to US detainee who lost baby after jail staff ‘stopped for coffee’ on way to hospital

A pregnant woman described as homeless and mentally ill who was allegedly left in her jail cell for two hours after her waters broke in March 2016 and then the journey to hospital was delayed has been offered almost half a million dollars by southern California government officials after she lost the baby and took legal action.

Jail staff eventually took her in a patrol car to the local medical centre but allegedly stopped to buy coffee at a Starbucks en route despite the woman, Sandra Quinones, then 28, being in a health emergency.

Quinones, who is no longer in the jail’s custody after a two-month sentence and had accused the staff of demonstrating “deliberate indifference”, must formally accept the settlement for the agreement to be considered final.

County officials had attempted to get the lawsuit thrown out. They had argued that the lawsuit should be dismissed because it had been filed after a statute of limitations passed. A district court judge ruled in favor of that argument from the county in October 2020. But an appellate court overturned the decision.

Stat of the day: drinking tea may be linked to lower death risk

When compared with those who do not have tea, people who consumed two or more cups each day had between a 9% and 13% lower risk of mortality, according to a study. However, the research did not definitively establish that tea was the cause of the lower mortality of tea drinkers, because it could not exclude that this was down to other health factors associated with tea consumption.

Fernando Rodriguez Artalejo, a professor of preventive medicine and public health at the Autonomous University of Madrid, said: “This article shows that regular consumption of black tea (the most widely consumed tea in Europe) is associated with a modest reduction in total and, especially, cardiovascular disease mortality over 10 years in a middle-aged, mostly white, adult general population.”

“There was no drugs in my system, no alcohol, nothing. It was pure abuse and I haven’t even really shared even half of it,” said Spears. The singer described the “extent of my madness” as “playing chase with paparazzi, which is still to this day one of the most fun things I did about being famous, so I don’t know what was so harmful about that”.

Climate check: fears for areas in Pakistan cut off by floods

01:48 Pakistan floods: drone footage shows scale of destruction – video

In Pakistan, where unusually strong monsoon rains have damaged more than 1m homes and killed more than 1,100 people, there are growing fears for people living in communities cut off by devastating flooding fuelled by a climate crisis to which the south Asian country is particularly vulnerable since it has more glaciers than anywhere else outside the polar regions.

“We are facing a lack of financial resources, tents and other relief goods and connectivity as all major highways are badly damaged … hampering our relief efforts,” the chief minister of the southern province of Balochistan Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo, said, adding that his province had sustained more than 200bn rupees ($900m) of damage.

Last Thing: male dolphins form lifelong bonds that help them find mates

Researcher observed bottlenose dolphins off the coast of Australia for years, including in mating season, and then analysed the animals’ alliances.



Research that confirms behavior not previously proven among animals has found dolphins forge long-term friendships and cooperate among and between cliques to find mates and fight off competitors. “Before our study, it had been thought that cooperative alliances between groups were unique to humans,” said Dr Richard Connor, a behavioural ecologist at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth and one of the lead authors of the paper.

Sofia Quaglia writes that the findings appear to support the “social brain” hypothesis: that mammals’ brains evolved to be larger in size for animals that keep track of their social interactions and networks. Humans and dolphins are the two animals with the largest brains relative to body size. “It’s not a coincidence,” Connor said. “I would say that dolphins and humans have converged in the evolution of between-group alliances – an incredibly complex social system … And it’s astonishing because we are so different from dolphins.”

e901c117-b8b7-4629-8985-bd7ef13d6fa0,"Human-driven climate change is expected to cause about 110 trillion tons of ice to melt off Greenland's ice shield — and even the most drastic preventive measures can't stop it, according to a study published in Nature Climate Change this week.

The result of the melt could be up to a foot of global sea level rise, which would have severe global consequences on both coastal and inland regions.

David Bahr is a glaciologist at the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research at the University of Colorado, Boulder. He joins Here & Now's Peter O'Dowd to talk about the study and the consequences of its findings."

I'm standing at the edge of the Greenland ice sheet, mesmerized by a mind-blowing scene of natural destruction. A milewide section of glacier front has fractured and is collapsing into the ocean, calving an immense iceberg.

Seracs, giant columns of ice the height of three-story houses, are being tossed around like dice. And the previously submerged portion of this immense block of glacier ice just breached the ocean—a frothing maelstrom flinging ice cubes of several tons high into the air. The resulting tsunami inundates all in its path as it radiates from the glacier's calving front.

Fortunately, I'm watching from a clifftop a couple of miles away. But even here, I can feel the seismic shocks through the ground.

Despite the spectacle, I'm keenly aware that this spells yet more unwelcome news for the world's low-lying coastlines.

As a field glaciologist, I've worked on ice sheets for more than 30 years. In that time, I have witnessed some gobsmacking changes. The past few years in particular have been unnerving for the sheer rate and magnitude of change underway. My revered textbooks taught me that ice sheets respond over millennial time scales, but that's not what we're seeing today.

A study published Aug. 29, 2022, demonstrates—for the first time—that Greenland's ice sheet is now so out of balance with prevailing Arctic climate that it no longer can sustain its current size. It is irreversibly committed to retreat by at least 59,000 square kilometers (22,780 square miles), an area considerably larger than Denmark, Greenland's protectorate state.

Even if all the greenhouse gas emissions driving global warming ceased today, we find that Greenland's ice loss under current temperatures will raise global sea level by at least 10.8 inches (27.4 centimeters). That's more than current models forecast, and it's a highly conservative estimate. If every year were like 2012, when Greenland experienced a heat wave, that irreversible commitment to sea level rise would triple. That's an ominous portent given that these are climate conditions we have already seen, not a hypothetical future scenario.

Our study takes a completely new approach—it is based on observations and glaciological theory rather than sophisticated numerical models. The current generation of coupled climate and ice sheet models used to forecast future sea level rise fail to capture the emerging processes that we see amplifying Greenland's ice loss.

How Greenland got to this point

The Greenland ice sheet is a massive, frozen reservoir that resembles an inverted pudding bowl. The ice is in constant flux, flowing from the interior—where it is over 1.9 miles (3 kilometers) thick, cold and snowy—to its edges, where the ice melts or calves bergs.

In all, the ice sheet locks up enough fresh water to raise global sea level by 24 feet (7.4 meters).

David Attenborough takes us on a virtuoso tour of the Greenland ice sheet.

Greenland's terrestrial ice has existed for about 2.6 million years and has expanded and contracted with two dozen or so ""ice age"" cycles lasting 70,000 or 100,000 years, punctuated by around 10,000-year warm interglacials. Each glacial is driven by shifts in Earth's orbit that modulate how much solar radiation reaches the Earth's surface. These variations are then reinforced by snow reflectivity, or albedo; atmospheric greenhouse gases; and ocean circulation that redistributes that heat around the planet.

We are currently enjoying an interglacial period—the Holocene. For the past 6,000 years Greenland, like the rest of the planet, has benefited from a mild and stable climate with an ice sheet in equilibrium—until recently. Since 1990, as the atmosphere and ocean have warmed under rapidly increasing greenhouse gas emissions, Greenland's mass balance has gone into the red. Ice losses due to enhanced melt, rain, ice flow and calving now far exceed the net gain from snow accumulation.

What does the future hold?

The critical questions are, how fast is Greenland losing its ice, and what does it mean for future sea level rise?

Greenland's ice loss has been contributing about 0.04 inches (1 millimeter) per year to global sea level rise over the past decade.

Greenland’s ice mass loss measured by NASA’s Grace satellites.

This net loss is split between surface melt and dynamic processes that accelerate outlet glacier flow and are greatly exacerbated by atmospheric and oceanic warming, respectively. Though complex in its manifestation, the concept is simple: Ice sheets don't like warm weather or baths, and the heat is on.

What the future will bring is trickier to answer.

The models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predict a sea level rise contribution from Greenland of around 4 inches (10 centimeters) by 2100, with a worst-case scenario of 6 inches (15 centimeters).

But that prediction is at odds with what field scientists are witnessing from the ice sheet itself.

According to our findings, Greenland will lose at least 3.3% of its ice, over 100 trillion metric tons. This loss is already committed—ice that must melt and calve icebergs to reestablish Greenland's balance with prevailing climate.

We're observing many emerging processes that the models don't account for that increase the ice sheet's vulnerability. For example:

The issue with models

Part of the problem is that the models used for forecasting are mathematical abstractions that include only processes that are fully understood, quantifiable and deemed important.

Models reduce reality to a set of equations that are solved repeatedly on banks of very fast computers. Anyone into cutting-edge engineering—including me—knows the intrinsic value of models for experimentation and testing of ideas. But they are no substitute for reality and observation. It is apparent that current model forecasts of global sea level rise underestimate its actual threat over the 21st century. Developers are making constant improvements, but it's tricky, and there's a dawning realization that the complex models used for long-term sea level forecasting are not fit for purpose.

There are also ""unknown unknowns""—those processes and feedbacks that we don't yet realize and that models can never anticipate. They can be understood only by direct observations and literally drilling into the ice.

That's why, rather than using models, we base our study on proven glaciological theory constrained by two decades of actual measurements from weather stations, satellites and ice geophysics.

It's not too late

It's an understatement that the societal stakes are high, and the risk is tragically real going forward. The consequences of catastrophic coastal flooding as sea level rises are still unimaginable to the majority of the billion or so people who live in low-lying coastal zones of the planet.

Personally, I remain hopeful that we can get on track. I don't believe we've passed any doom-laden tipping point that irreversibly floods the planet's coastlines. Of what I understand of the ice sheet and the insight our new study brings, it's not too late to act.

But fossil fuels and emissions must be curtailed now, because time is short and the water rises—faster than forecast.

717cb133-2374-4b34-9ee0-165b19f69a79,Zombie ice will raise sea levels more than twice as much as previously forecast
921c419e-fa9e-4b81-ae97-f496074fb1f9,"""Zombie ice"" might sound like a concept out of a 1950s B movie, but it's a real thing — and it's dangerous. Scientists said this week that zombie ice from Greenland's melting ice sheet will raise global sea levels by an average of 10 inches.

Climate change is the culprit, of course. And the impact of that melting ice will be unexpectedly huge.

""The unavoidable 10 inches in the study is more than twice as much sea level rise as scientists had previously expected from the melting of Greenland's ice sheet,"" The Associated Press reports. A 2021 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, for example, had previously estimated that Greenland would be responsible for up to five inches of rising water globally. Can anything be done about the attack of the zombie ice? Here's everything you need to know:

What is zombie ice?

""It's dead ice. It's just going to melt and disappear from the ice sheet,"" said William Colgan, a glaciologist who co-authored the new study. Here's how that works: In the pre-climate change times, snowfall in Greenland was expected to refresh and thicken the sides of the country's glaciers, AP reports. ""But in the last few decades, there's less replenishment and more melting, creating imbalance."" The so-called ""zombie ice"" is ice that still exists but is ""no longer getting replenished by parent glaciers now receiving less snow."" And soon enough, much of it will simply melt.

Of course, it's not news that Greenland's ice sheet — the second-biggest in the world, after Antarctica — is melting quickly. Scientists from Ohio State University in 2020 reported that the country's snowfall was no longer keeping up with the ice melt — which meant that the ice sheet would keep melting even if global temperatures stopped rising, or even started to cool. That latter scenario obviously hasn't happened. Continued rising temperatures mean that glaciers are now sitting in pools of ever deeper water that accelerate their melting process: ""Warm ocean water melts glacier ice,"" the Ohio State scientists said, ""and also makes it difficult for the glaciers to grow back to their previous positions."""
9e3bb4c4-aad9-4a2d-9703-b881e2419afa,"Even if the world stopped emitting greenhouse gases today, the melting of Greenland’s massive ice sheets could raise sea levels by nearly a foot, according to a study published in Nature Climate Change on Monday.

What the study found: The researchers project that Greenland will lose 3.3% of its ice sheet mass, or around 110 trillion tons of ice. This will add at least 10 inches to the global sea level. The amount of water expected to be released is enough to cover the entire United States in 37 feet of water, according to The Associated Press.

The study doesn’t identify a specific time frame for the melting, but the authors said it could happen between now and the year 2100.

“The point is, we need to plan for that ice as if it weren’t on the ice sheet in the near future, within a century or so,” said William Colgan, a study co-author and glaciologist at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, according to The Washington Post.

Researchers point to “zombie ice” — ice that is still attached to thicker glaciers but is no longer being fed by them — as the culprit for the sea rise.

“It’s dead ice,” Colgan said. “It’s just going to melt and disappear from the ice sheet. This ice has been consigned to the ocean, regardless of what climate (emissions) scenario we take now.”

It’s “more like one foot in the grave,” said Jason Box, lead author on the study and glaciologist at the Greenland survey.

“It is a very conservative rock-bottom minimum,” Box said, according to The Guardian. “Realistically, we will see this figure more than double within this century.”

What it means: Researchers say the level of ice melt is unavoidable at this point. Their projections are more than twice the previous estimates of 2-5 inches released by last year’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report — though a comparison to the IPCC’s report isn’t perfect, because the newest report doesn’t factor in additional emissions or specify when the melting will occur.

Ten inches of sea level would have harsh consequences in the United States, and would be calamitous for many low-sea level and island nations. At last year’s COP26 summit in Scotland, the top diplomat from the Pacific island nation of Tuvalu gave a prerecorded address while standing up to his thighs in ocean water to illustrate the existential threat sea level rise poses.

In the U.S., the most catastrophic floods could occur five times as often with 10 inches of sea level rise, according to a recent report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Moderate floods would occur nearly 10 times as often.

Globally, around 680 million people live in low-lying coastal zones, and more than a third of the entire population lives within 65 miles of the ocean.

Hope is not lost: As dire as the team’s findings are, the research offers a glimmer of hope. Even if it’s too late to prevent significant ice melt and sea level rise, cutting emissions to prevent further warming can fend off even more catastrophic possibilities."

4c25ef38-df5d-4865-88ee-7e5e38abf090,"The predictions are more dire than other forecasts, though they use different assumptions. While the study did not specify a time frame for the melting and sea-level rise, the authors suggested much of it can play out between now and the year 2100.

The findings in Nature Climate Change project that it is now inevitable that 3.3 percent of the Greenland ice sheet will melt — equal to 110 trillion tons of ice, the researchers said. That will trigger nearly a foot of global sea-level rise.

Human-driven climate change has set in motion massive ice losses in Greenland that couldn’t be halted even if the world stopped emitting greenhouse gases today, according to a study published Monday.

‘’The point is, we need to plan for that ice as if it weren’t on the ice sheet in the near future, within a century or so,’’ William Colgan, a study coauthor who studies the ice sheet from its surface with his colleagues at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, said in a video interview.

‘’Every study has bigger numbers than the last. It’s always faster than forecast,’’ Colgan said.

One reason that new research appears worse than other findings may just be that it is simpler. It tries to calculate how much ice Greenland must lose as it recalibrates to a warmer climate. In contrast, sophisticated computer simulations of how the ice sheet will behave under future scenarios for global emissions have produced less alarming predictions.

A one-foot rise in global sea levels would have severe consequences. If the sea level along the US coasts rose by an average of 10 to 12 inches by 2050, a recent report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration found, the most destructive floods would take place five times as often, and moderate floods would become 10 times as frequent.

Other countries — low-lying island nations and developing ones, like Bangladesh — are even more vulnerable. These nations, which have done little to fuel the higher temperatures that are now thawing the Greenland ice sheet, lack the billions of dollars it will take to adapt to rising seas.

The paper’s lead author, Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland scientist Jason Box, collaborated with scientists based at institutions in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Norway, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United States to assess the extent of ice loss already locked in by human activity.

Just last year, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change — which generally forecasts lower figures for total ice loss from Greenland by the end of the century — projected around half a foot of sea-level rise from Greenland by the year 2100 at the high end. That scenario assumed humans would emit a large amount of greenhouse gases for another 80 years.

The current study, in contrast, does not factor in any additional greenhouse gas emissions or specify when the melting would take place, making the comparison with the UN report imperfect.

The finding that 3.3 percent of Greenland is, in effect, already lost represents ‘’a minimum, a lower bound,’’ Box said. It could be much worse than that, the study suggests, especially if the world continues to burn fossil fuels and if 2012, which set a record for Greenland ice loss, becomes more like the norm.

But that aspect of the study offers hope: Even if more sea-level rise is locked in than previously believed, cutting emissions fast to limit warming close to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) would prevent things from getting much worse.

Greenland is the world’s largest island and is covered with a sheet of ice that, if it melted entirely, could raise sea levels by more than 20 feet. That is not in doubt — nor is the fact that in past warm periods in Earth’s history, the ice sheet has been much smaller than it is today. The question has always been how much ice will thaw as temperatures rise — and how fast.

Melt rates have been increasing in the past two decades, and Greenland is the largest single ice-based contributor to the rate of global sea-level rise, surpassing contributions from both the larger Antarctic ice sheet and from mountain glaciers around the world. Greenland lies in the Arctic, which is warming much faster than the rest of the world.

Higher Arctic temperatures cause large amounts of ice on Greenland’s surface to thaw. While the island’s oceanfront glaciers are also shedding enormous icebergs at an accelerating pace, it is this surface melt — which translates into gushing ice rivers, disappearing lakes, and giant waterfalls vanishing into crevasses — that causes the biggest ice losses."
b44b4508-bb9a-4fc0-aa5e-ee48ef8dcaeb,"Even if the world stopped burning fossil fuels this instant, the build-up of heat that they’ve caused in the atmosphere means Greenland’s ice melt will unavoidably raise global sea levels by at least 10 inches (27cm).

For the first time, glaciologists have determined what minimum ice loss will be from the Greenland ice sheet due to average global warming of 1.1C over the past 150 years, and how it will elevate sea levels.

The Greenland ice sheet will “inevitably” lose 3.3 per cent of its current volume, or 110 quadrillion tonnes of ice, according to the scientists from the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS).

The research, conducted on the climate in the Arctic from 2000 to 2019, reveals “the absolute lower bound for what’s to come”.

The study was published on Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change.

“It is a very conservative rock-bottom minimum. Realistically, we will see this figure more than double within this century,” Professor Jason Box, the lead author, said in a statement.

“In the foreseeable scenario that global warming will only continue, the contribution of the Greenland ice sheet to sea level rise will only continue increasing. When we take the extreme melt year 2012 and take it as a hypothetical average constant climate later this century, the committed mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet more than doubles to 78cm.”

The study didn’t rely on computer modelling to make forecasts which can be uncertain. Instead, it’s based on ice measurements from satellite data, and the scientists’ real-world observations of the ice sheet.

The study solely examines the impact of glacial melt from Greenland and not other polar regions. Research published earlier this month found that on the other side of the planet, the collapse of Antarctica’s “sleeping giant” could cause a planetary-scale change in the coming centuries.

Prof Box noted that while the team’s unconventional research method has given new insight into the volume of ice loss, the downside is that it lacks a detailed timeframe.

“In order to get the figure that we have, we had to let go of the time factor in the calculation,” he said. “But our observations suggest that most of the committed sea level rise will occur this century.”

Researchers studied the ice sheet’s “snow line” – the boundary between what melts and what doesn’t during summer months. The snow line changes from year to year, depending on whether the year is hotter or colder.

During winter, falling snow used to rebuild the ice sheet, keeping it in balance after summer melting. However, the climate crisis has upended this process.

“I think starving would be a good phrase [for what’s happening to the ice]”, co-author and glaciologist Dr William Colgan told the Associated Press.

The inevitable 10in loss is more than twice what scientists have previously predicted. The latest, 2021 assessment from the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the global authority on climate science, forecasts two to five inches of expected sea level rise due to melting of the Greenland ice sheet by the end of the century."

A massive ice sheet in Greenland is set to raise global sea levels by nearly a foot by the end of this century, in a melting event driven by human-caused climate change, according to a study published on Monday.

The findings in the Journal Nature Climate Change show that 3.3% of Greenland's ice sheet will melt, which is equivalent to 110 trillion metric tons of ice. The ice loss will prompt about 10 inches of sea level rise between now and 2100.

Scientists warned the melting is inevitable even if the world immediately stops emitting planet-warming greenhouse gases. The study's forecast of a minimum of 10 inches of sea level rise is more than twice as much sea level rise as researchers have previously predicted from the melting of Greenland's ice sheet.

It is the second biggest ice sheet in the world behind the one in the Antarctic and covers 80% of the island. Previous research has suggested that if all of the ice sheet were to melt, global sea levels could rise by as much as 23 feet."

Researchers used a new method to calculate Greenland’s minimum ice melt, looking at so-called “zombie ice” that is doomed to disappear as glaciers receive less snow. The snow line in Greenland has been creeping higher as the world warms, exposing the ice on the island’s edges. Without that snow as a buffer, researchers say, this “dead ice” will inevitably thaw into the ocean, pushing up sea levels around the planet. They calculated that 110 trillion tons of ice are destined to melt, or 3.3 percent of the Greenland ice sheet.

Though the study didn’t provide an exact timeline, researchers expect that this will take place by the end of the century, or by 2150 at the latest, with consequences for coastal areas around the world.

The new research used real-world data rather than the computer models that are typically used to calculate how much — and how quickly — Greenland’s ice sheet will melt. That might explain why the projections were so much higher than previously forecast. A report last year from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a panel of the world’s top scientists, projected a two- to five-inch rise by 2100, depending on how much more carbon gets pumped into the atmosphere. The new research suggests that extreme temperatures could eventually trigger as much as 30 inches of sea-level rise.

Some glaciologists contend that previous models, though they’re complex, lack the level of detail to reflect the real-world changes that are taking place. The world has already heated up by an average of 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial temperatures, and the Arctic is warming four times faster than the global average.

“Every study has bigger numbers than the last,” William Colgan, a study co-author at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, told the Washington Post. “It’s always faster than forecast.”

This isn’t the first time that researchers have had to revise their projections based on the real-world consequences of climate change. In 2020, wildfires burned 10 million acres in the Western United States, closer to what scientists had projected for 30 years in the future. In June last year, a heat wave that broiled parts of the Pacific Northwest in 120-degree temperatures was more in line with what researchers pictured might happen later this century.

It’s not so much that climate change has been progressing faster than scientists predicted, but that scientists have sometimes underestimated the dire effects of the warming that’s already here, Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, told Grist last year.

Despite accusations of “alarmism,” the projections that come out of the peer review process usually tend to err on the side of caution. One paper from 2012 found that researchers had misjudged the risks of the potential disintegration of the West Antarctic ice sheet. So perhaps it’s not all that surprising that the danger posed by the Greenland ice sheet, too, might have been underestimated until now."

By contrast, last year’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report projected a range of 2 to 5 inches (6 to 13 centimeters) for likely sea level rise from Greenland ice melt by the year 2100.

What scientists did for the study was look at the ice in balance. In perfect equilibrium, snowfall in the mountains in Greenland flows down and recharges and thickens the sides of glaciers, balancing out what’s melting on the edges. But in the last few decades there’s less replenishment and more melting, creating imbalance. Study authors looked at the ratio of what’s being added to what’s being lost and calculated that 3.3% of Greenland’s total ice volume will melt no matter what happens with the world cutting carbon pollution, Colgan said.

“I think starving would be a good phrase,” for what’s happening to the ice, Colgan said.

One of the study authors said that more than 120 trillion tons (110 trillion metric tons) of ice is already doomed to melt from the warming ice sheet’s inability to replenish its edges. When that ice melts into water, if it were concentrated only over the United States, it would be 37 feet (11 meters) deep.

The figures are a global average for sea level rise, but some places further away from Greenland would get more and places closer, like the U.S. East Coast, would get less. Although 10.6 inches may not sound like much, this would be over and above high tides and storms, making them even worse, so this much sea level rise “will have huge societal, economic and environmental impacts,” said Ellyn Enderlin, a geosciences professor at Boise State University, who wasn't part of the study.

“This is a really large loss and will have a detrimental effect on coastlines around the world,” said NYU’s David Holland who just returned from Greenland, but is not part of the study.

This is the first time scientists calculated a minimum ice loss — and accompanying sea level rise — for Greenland, one of Earth’s two massive ice sheets that are slowly shrinking because of climate change from burning coal, oil and natural gas. Scientists used an accepted technique for calculating minimum committed ice loss, the one used on mountain glaciers for the entire giant frozen island.

Pennsylvania State University glaciologist Richard Alley, who wasn’t part of the study but said it made sense, said the committed melting and sea level rise is like an ice cube put in a cup of hot tea in a warm room.

“You have committed mass loss from the ice,"" Alley said in an email. ""In the same way, most of the world’s mountain glaciers and the edges of Greenland would continue losing mass if temperatures were stabilized at modern levels because they have been put into warmer air just as your ice cube was put in warmer tea.""

Time is the key unknown here and a bit of a problem with the study, said two outside ice scientists, Leigh Stearns of the University of Kansas and Sophie Nowicki of the University of Buffalo. The researchers in the study said they couldn't estimate the timing of the committed melting, yet in the last sentence they mention, “within this century,” without supporting it, Stearns said.

Colgan responded that the team doesn’t know how long it will take for all the doomed ice to melt, but making an educated guess, it would probably be by the end of this century, or at least by 2150.

Colgan said this is actually all a best case scenario. The year 2012 (and to a different degree 2019 ) was a huge melt year, when the equilibrium between adding and subtracting ice was most out of balance. If Earth starts to undergo more years like 2012, Greenland melt could trigger 30 inches (78 centimeters) of sea level rise, he said. Those two years seem extreme now, but years that look normal now would have been extreme 50 years ago, he said.

“That’s how climate change works,” Colgan said. “Today’s outliers become tomorrow’s averages.”

b47a94a8-692d-4f64-9f2e-9ec51c3edb90,"The 27cm predicted sea rise is more than twice as much as scientists previously expected from Greenland’s melting ice sheet.

Greenland’s fast-melting ice sheet will cause a huge sea level rise with potentially ominous implications over this century as temperatures continue to rise, according to a study published on Monday.

Melting “zombie” ice from the enormous Greenland ice sheet will eventually raise the global sea level by at least 27 centimetres (10 inches) just on its own. “Zombie”, or doomed ice is still attached to thicker areas of the sheet but is no longer getting fed by larger glaciers.

The study in the journal Nature Climate Change said sea rise could reach as much as 78cm (30 inches) – enough to swamp vast swathes of low-lying coastlines and supercharge floods and storm surges.

This should serve “as an ominous prognosis for Greenland’s trajectory through a 21st century of warming”, the authors said.

By contrast, last year’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report projected a range of 6-13cm (2-5 inches) for likely sea level rise from Greenland ice melt by the year 2100.

Glaciologists found regardless of any future fossil fuel pollution, warming to date will cause the Greenland ice sheet to shed 3.3 percent of its volume, committing 27.4cm sea level rise.

The study’s lead author Jason Box, a glaciologist at the Greenland survey, said it is “like one foot in the grave”.

Co-author William Colgan, a glaciologist at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, said: “This ice has been consigned to the ocean, regardless of what climate [emissions] scenario we take now.”

‘Radically different’ methodology

The theory that researchers used was initially developed to explain changes in Alpine glaciers, said Box.

This holds if more snow piles up on top of a glacier, it causes lower areas to expand. In this case, the reduced snow is shrinking in lower parts of the glacier as it rebalances, he said.

Box said the methods his team used were “radically different” from computer modelling but could complement this work to predict the effects of sea level rise in the coming decades.

He said while climate change was raising more immediate threats such as food security, the accelerating pace of sea level rise will become a huge challenge.

“It’s kind of decades in the future when it will just force its way onto the agenda because it will begin displacing people more and more and more,” said Box.

This is the first time scientists calculated a minimum ice loss – and accompanying sea level rise – for Greenland, one of Earth’s two gigantic ice sheets that are slowly shrinking because of climate change from burning coal, oil and natural gas.

The world has warmed an average of nearly 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.4 Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times, unleashing a catalogue of impacts from heatwaves to more intense storms.

Under the Paris climate deal, countries have agreed to limit warming to 2C (4.0F).

But in their report on climate effects this year, the IPCC said that even if warming is stabilised at 2C to 2.5C (35.6F to 36.5F) “coastlines will continue to reshape over millennia, affecting at least 25 megacities and drowning low-lying areas”, which were home to up to 1.3 billion people in 2010.

Colgan said his research team does not know how long it will take for all the doomed ice to melt, but making an educated guess it would probably be by the end of this century, or at least by 2150."

Scientists say that the melting of an ice cap off the coast of Greenland will cause an inevitable global sea level rise of at least 27 centimetres.

Researchers studying how global warming is affecting a massive sheet of ice off the coast of Greenland have determined that a major rise in ocean levels is unstoppable, even if the international community were to stop global carbon emissions overnight.

Known as the Greenland ice cap, the massive reservoir of frozen water in the Fram Strait exists in a constant state of flux, expanding and contracting while spanning three kilometres at its centre and containing enough frozen water to raise global ocean levels by 7.4 metres.

Yup. This makes me skeptical that we can deliberately implement the emissions reductions needed to achieve the Paris Agreement SSP1-2.6 scenario. 🙄 https://t.co/U4ajeBy4W7 — William Colgan, Ph.D. (@GlacierBytes) August 24, 2022

Field scientists from the National Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland have described the 110 tonnes of sea ice expected to melt from the ice sheet as the “absolute minimum,” with a worst case scenario due projecting ocean levels could rise by 78cm.

“The minimum of 27cm is the sea-level rise deficit that we have accrued to date and it’s going to get paid out, no matter what we do going forward,” Dr William Colgan from the National Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland told The Guardian.

“The difference between 78cm and 27cm highlights the [difference] that can be made through implementing the Paris Agreement. There is still a lot of room to minimise the damage.”

Due to the method used to predict the ice loss, scientists have not provided a timeline for when the effects of the melting ice sheet will take effect, but have stressed that the 27cm minimum estimate would “realistically” double this century.

“Whether it’s coming in 100 years or 150 years, it’s coming. And the sea-level rise we are committed to is growing at present, because of the climate trajectory we’re on,” Dr Colgan said."

The Prime Minister is under fire this week from environmental groups after the government green-lit a number of oil and gas exploration projects despite being elected on a climate change mandate.

Nearly 50 000 square clicks have been opened up by Anthony Albanese’s first government, which is celebrating it’s 100th day in power today, which he says is “routine” and “needed”.

Speaking to reporters today in Sydney, Mr Albanese said he was trying to find the magic button in his office which will stop Australia’s dependence on fossil fuels overnight but has yet to locate it.

“It’s an everyday struggle,” he said.

“But yeah, I understand. I understand why you’ve got these poached egg-eating teal voters upset. I can understand why you’ve got green voters upset. But the reality of the situation is that you just can’t stop using fossil fuels straight away. It’s like quitting smoking. Going cold turkey doesn’t always work and there’s much better ways to do it. Going cold turkey creates a huge amount of personal and spiritual turmoil. Just ask Barnaby Joyce,”

“Whereas, I’m reading the Alan Carr book on quitting fossil fuels. I’m on the Champax. By the end of my first term of government, we’ll still be knocking back Nicobate tic-tacs when we smell fresh coffee in the morning and when that first cold schooner hits our lips after, I’m sorry Shaq block your ears, after an absolute CUNT of a week. That’s when you want to enjoy the smoothest Peter Stuyvesant blue from a soft pack in the soft spring sunshine. We will not give in,”

“Back to what I was saying. When working Australians can afford a place to live and an electric vehicle, then sure. But until then, people need fossil fuels for transport. They need them to charge their Teslas. In the future, sure, we might not need them but in the next decade, if you think we can just do without this stuff then you’ve had too much poached egg in your life,”

“But what if I just banned fossil fuels from tonight at 6pm? Would that make the Greens happy? It would certainly make it harder for Adam [Bandt] to get home to Melbourne. He’d be doing the old Cliff Young down the Hume if you ask me.”

Mr Albanese refused to answer any questions and left.

Michael Wheatley, Rock Forest Let’s put the joy of reading back into Book Week Antoinette Lattouf highlights the growing commercialisation and focus on the “dress ups” of Book Week, which continues to detract from what is at its core – a celebration of Australian writing for children (“Read the room: we are over Book Week”, August 25). Book Week is so much more than simply “dress ups” in schools and public libraries nationally. It’s used by the dwindling number of teacher librarians to engage the whole school in rich learning activities about the books shortlisted for awards by the Children’s Book Council of Australia.

If you are tired of the annual Book Week dress up, find out what else is happening at your school. If a school is only holding the tired book character parade, ask why. Parents, be the change you want to see in Book Week to rightly celebrate kids book creators and the opportunity to engage more children with the joys of reading. Sharon McGuinness, Thirroul I agree, let’s leave the outlandish costumes to the Met Gala, but you are missing the point of Book Week. The annual book week parade is not a competition for the best mother award, rather a celebration of books, the joy of reading, of characters, of stories and shared book experiences. Book Week highlights the importance of these experiences and a spotlight on literature for one week in the school year can only be a good thing. Forget the gala costumes and grab a pirate hat or a striped red T-shirt and get with the spirit. Stephanie Harrison, Lane Cove

I still remember the frantic terror of scrambling for costumes for Book Week when I was a working mum of three primary schoolers and also studying for a Master’s degree. One year I sent one of my kids to school in a Buzz Lightyear outfit. Even though we had a Toy Story book at home, the librarian deemed Toy Story to be a movie, not a book. The offending children wearing Toy Story costumes and their parents were publicly chastised. Oh, the shame! Belinda Stapleton, Roseville Loading Well said, Antoinette Lattouf.

Value seems to be the domain of winning and having the finances to make sure you are the “top dog” for a moment in life. It is laughable that some people are so competitive that they judge and value others by their address, size of homes, the car they drive, the school they attended, occupation or the Book Week costume your child wears.

Fair play for fair pay I suggest unions change their attack re enterprise bargaining which will struggle to gain traction due to the small percentage of the working population that are union members (“Unions demand industry EBAs”, August 25). The unions should demand that all employees of a company receive the same percentage pay increases and bonuses as the top management; this would at least bring some degree of fairness into the system. It could also be argued that people on the lowest wage levels in a company receive twice the wage increase or bonus as the top tier. Geoff Lindsay, Thurgoona Human cost I suspect the Chinese companies and government will be as dismissive of international trade law as they are with international maritime law (“Blood gold”, August 25).

Waging war on productivity Andrew Leigh laments the drop in productivity in Australian businesses (“Economy has grown moribund: research”, August 25). In the past productivity was driven by investment by businesses into new technology and equipment, and those productivity improvements resulted in increased profit for those businesses. But businesses have found that there is a much easier way to increase profits without having to invest funds, and that is to simply suppress wages and reduce workers hours. Funds previously invested in improving productivity are now added to profits. The result has been a flatlining of wages while profits soar. And now, when businesses are bemoaning a lack of workers, they remain reluctant to increase wages or invest in training staff and want governments to fix their problem by increasing immigration. Businesses have become far too used to being propped up by governments.

The case for co-ed I am proud to say the all-girls boarding school I attended in the 1960s amalgamated with the boys school shortly after I left (Letters, August 25). We had so little contact with boys, except for a school social once a term. I was permitted to talk to my brother at church on Sunday, but even any suspicious letter from a boy was questioned by the principal to ensure all was above board. Needless to say, we were led to believe boys were aliens and to be avoided at all times. The new regime at my school is working very well, and how I wish I was there now and not in the system I endured for far too long. Robyn Lewis, Raglan Bang the scrum I have to take issue with your rugby union correspondent (Letters, August 25). I agree the ball is often fed to the second row (which could easily be fixed by refs adhering to the law) but even so, scrums are still a contest and an integral part of the game. Watch the Shute Shield and there are many instances of wins against the feed. And just last week, a penalty try was awarded from a scrum due to one team’s dominance. A dominant scrum is a potent weapon. If you abandon scrums, then you just end up like that other game, the one they don’t play in heaven. If you want to abolish scrums, then look to that other rugby game. It doesn’t matter where the ball is fed as the “scrum” is just 12 big blokes leaning on or against each other, and a win against the feed is just never going to happen if you don’t actually push and contest the ball. Guy Stockwell, Curl Curl

Wonder if your correspondent who suggests “rugby” should scrap scrums is getting real rugby confused with pretend rugby, i.e. rugby league? So-called scrums in league are laughable – six large men loosely bound together gently leaning against six other large men while the halfback pops the ball straight into the second row. I’ll admit that real rugby scrums often take too long to set and complete, but there’s no doubt they still represent a true contest for the ball, provided the referee properly polices the halfback. Good scrummaging teams e.g. Springboks, All Blacks and England use their scrum to move the advantage line back by up to five metres before releasing their backline, force penalties or secure the occasional pushover try. A well set and well-worked scrum is a thing of beauty. Martyn Yeomans, Sapphire Beach The scrum is integral to rugby and must be retained. How else could you get 16 slow, lumbering oafs out of the way to let the scintillating wingers and threequarters entertain, enthral and excite with their ethereal, nay, even empyrean, alacrity? Brian Byrne, Flinders Hidden charges The other day a friend arrived in his electric car for an overnight stay at my home. While I’m delighted to offer dinner, bed and breakfast, I was interested to see that plugging one’s car into the host’s electricity supply is now de rigueur. So as my electricity metre spun frantically all night, I asked myself, did he come to see me, or was I merely a convenient charging location? Perhaps the new norm will be to have friends evenly spaced at 250 kilometres along the main highways? And did he even consider for one moment that his efforts to save the planet were at my personal cost? He left, 96 per cent charged, with a cheery wave as he silently headed for his next charge – perhaps a long lunch at a friend’s home. John Hopkins, Moss Vale

380f930c-cce4-4708-b116-d8e8d960bc8a,"Sky News Political Editor Andrew Clennell says Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was “keen” to defend fossil fuels this morning despite the government’s aim of 43 per cent emissions reduction by 2030.

“Just to show how pragmatic Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is,” Mr Clennell said.

“He might be going for a 43 per cent climate emissions reduction target by 2030, but he was keen to defend fossil fuels this morning when asked about a decision announced yesterday by Resources Minister Madeleine King to open up thousands of kilometres in gas and oil exploration areas.”"
4159e579-2cfe-449f-9d67-e3a4999a58ef,"The Albanese government has a decision to make: does it want people to think it takes the climate crisis seriously? Because at the moment it’s sending mixed messages.

On one hand, it is telling a story of progress. Its ascent to power has, along with the rise of the teals and the Greens, reset the way the country thinks about dealing with the problem.

The 2030 national emissions reduction target (a 43% cut by 2030, compared with 2005) is not what the evidence says is needed or possible, but it is a step in the right direction. It is expected to soon be legislated, which if nothing else is a signal of intent.

Led by the climate change minister, Chris Bowen, work is under way on policies to cut carbon pollution from big industry, drive the uptake of electric vehicles and create an offshore windfarm industry. The national carbon credit system, which has been sharply criticised, is under review.

The hard decisions lie ahead – we’re still in the broad intentions phase – but there are policies that could start the long-delayed transformation to a cleaner economy if well-designed. That’s worth some cautious optimism.

But this is only part of the story. The other part is more familiar from the past nine years, and sounds a lot like climate denial.

It was on display last week when the resources minister, Madeleine King, announced the release of new areas along the Australian coast for the oil and gas industry to explore and potentially exploit.

This wasn’t a surprise – sites for offshore petroleum exploration are released annually, and work on the current batch was under way before the May election – but the underlying message from King’s media statement was that nothing has changed since Labor replaced the pro-fossil fuel Coalition.

King claimed the new exploration areas would “play an important role in securing future energy supplies” and the petroleum sector was “vital for the economy and meeting the energy needs of Australians”. The traditional line about gas playing a “key role as a transition fuel” also got a run.

It is, of course, true that Australian households and businesses use gas for heating, cooking and some electricity generation and high-temperature industrial processes. The message from King is that she sees no need to drive change away from that.

We should break down what we are talking about here. Gas is a fossil fuel, with higher greenhouse gas emissions than is often claimed. Australia already has several contentious new gasfields proposed for development. The Climate Council estimates 28% of the country’s land mass is covered by gas exploration permits or applications for gas exploration.

New fields are proposed despite the head of the International Energy Agency warning that no new oil and gas reservoirs should open if the world is to do what was agreed in the landmark 2015 Paris climate agreement. A study last year found 90% of coal and 60% of oil and gas reserves need to stay in the ground to give just a 50% chance of limiting global heating to the global goal of 1.5C.

While there is a debate about whether Australia faces an impending gas shortage, a case exists that new reservoirs will not be needed if the country better manages what it already has available and starts to reduce demand by replacing it with renewably generated electricity. As Bowen told the Energy Insiders podcast: “We’re going to have to electrify everything that can be electrified.”

The new oil and gas exploration areas, nominated by the industry and covering nearly 50,000 sq km off the coast of the Northern Territory, Victoria and Western Australia, are in addition to what is currently being considered for development. They would likely take years to prove up, years more to get to a point where gas was extracted. It is quite possible none will reach that stage.

But King made the acreage release a bigger deal than it was by implying a scenario under which multibillion dollar fossil fuel reservoirs across 10 areas could be opened through the decades ahead. Her media statement reads like a bet the world will fail on climate change.

The minister has a get-out-of-jail card: carbon capture and storage (CCS). She last week awarded two new offshore storage areas – one off Darwin, the other off northern WA – to the major gas companies Inpex and Woodside, the idea being they will capture emissions from new developments and bury them under the seabed.

King described CCS as a “proven technology that can support the petroleum sector in its low-carbon transition”, repeating a line from gas industry proponents. But as yet there is little evidence to support this.

According to the Global CCS Institute, existing plants across the globe have the capacity to store just 40m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year. One new gas field can add hundreds of millions of tonnes of CO 2 to the atmosphere across its lifetime.

If CCS technology does develop – and let’s hope that it does – it will be needed to store greenhouse gas from industries in which it is difficult to cut pollution. Cement production, for example. Scientists say underground storage sites will also be needed to store CO 2 drawn down from the atmosphere using direct air capture.

But for now, CCS announcements are used to justify new fossil fuel investments that are adding to global pollution. They are basically a black box, allowing companies and governments to claim they have plans for net zero emissions, never mind the details.

To some extent, King’s stance on gas – and the split in the government’s climate messaging – is explained by geography. The resources minister is from WA, where the gas industry is hugely influential and its links with the Labor party run deep. The state’s energy emissions have increased by more than 50% since 2005, largely due to a huge expansion in gas exports.

The story is slightly complicated by gas being relatively cheap in WA, and Western Australians getting more than 30% of their electricity from gas-fired plants.

It is a different story in the east, where there is hardly any gas power in the grid, gas prices are ridiculous and the energy transition will be a straight jump from coal to renewable energy with backup.

Surveys suggest a majority of Australians are on board with this idea, are increasingly worried about the climate crisis, and see it as an economic opportunity that should be embraced. Recent history shows voters will re-draw the electoral map if a government claims to be acting while pulling in the opposite direction.

Labor would be wise to avoid heading further down that path."

ISLAMABAD — Deaths from widespread flooding in Pakistan topped 1,000 since mid-June, officials said Sunday, as the country’s climate minister called the deadly monsoon season “a serious climate catastrophe.”

Flash flooding from the heavy rains has washed away villages and crops as soldiers and rescue workers evacuated stranded residents to the safety of relief camps and provided food to thousands of displaced Pakistanis.

Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Authority reported the death toll since the monsoon season began earlier than normal this year — in mid-June — reached 1,061 people after new fatalities were reported across different provinces.

Sherry Rehman, a Pakistani senator and the country’s top climate official, said in a video posted on Twitter that Pakistan is experiencing a “serious climate catastrophe, one of the hardest in the decade.”

“We are at the moment at the ground zero of the front line of extreme weather events, in an unrelenting cascade of heatwaves, forest fires, flash floods, multiple glacial lake outbursts, flood events and now the monster monsoon of the decade is wreaking non-stop havoc throughout the country,” she said. The on-camera statement was retweeted by the country’s ambassador to the European Union.

Flooding from the Swat River overnight affected northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where tens of thousands of people — especially in the Charsadda and Nowshehra districts — have been evacuated from their homes to relief camps set up in government buildings. Many have also taken shelter on roadsides, said Kamran Bangash, a spokesperson for the provincial government.

Bangash said some 180,000 people have been evacuated from Charsadda and 150,000 from Nowshehra district villages.

Khaista Rehman, 55, no relation to the climate minister, took shelter with his wife and three children on the side of the Islamabad-Peshawar highway after his home in Charsadda was submerged overnight.

“Thank God we are safe now on this road quite high from the flooded area,” he said. “Our crops are gone and our home is destroyed but I am grateful to Allah that we are alive and I will restart life with my sons.”

The unprecedented monsoon season has affected all four of the country’s provinces. Nearly 300,000 homes have been destroyed, numerous roads rendered impassable and electricity outages have been widespread, affecting millions of people.

Pope Francis on Sunday said he wanted to assure his “closeness to the populations of Pakistan struck by flooding of disastrous proportions.’ Speaking during a pilgrimage to the Italian town of L’Aquila, which was hit by a deadly earthquake in 2009, Francis said he was praying “for the many victims, for the injured and the evacuated, and so that international solidarity will be prompt and generous.”

Rehman told Turkish news outlet TRT World that by the time the rains recede, “we could well have one-fourth or one-third of Pakistan under water.”

“This is something that is a global crisis and of course, we will need better planning and sustainable development on the ground. … We’ll need to have climate resilient crops as well as structures,” she said.

In May, Rehman told BBC Newshour that both the country’s north and south were witnessing extreme weather events because of rising temperatures. “So in the north actually just now we are … experiencing what is known as glacial lake outburst floods which we have many of because Pakistan is home to the highest number of glaciers outside the polar region.”

The government has deployed soldiers to help civilian authorities in rescue and relief operations across the country. The Pakistani army also said in a statement it airlifted 22 tourists trapped in a valley in the country’s north to safety.

Prime Minister Shabaz Sharif visited flooding victims in city of Jafferabad in Baluchistan. He vowed the government would provide housing to all those who lost their homes.

There have been many positive moments on this journey. But on balance, it’s clear from the declining health of our ecosystems and species and intensifying extreme weather events lashing Australia that we need to quickly step up efforts to address climate change and protect the environment.

This must begin with changing how environment ministers interpret the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Act (EPBC).

Despite campaigning to take action on climate change, and just days after passing a 43 per cent emissions reduction target through the House of Representatives, Mr Albanese released 47,000 square kilometres for fossil fuel drilling last Wednesday.

Resources Minister Madeleine King - a member of Labor's right faction - said the release was necessary to alleviate future domestic gas shortfalls.

Anthony Albanese (pictured with partner Jodie Haydon) is facing anger from his left flank

Global gas prices have soared this year in the wake of sanctions on Russian energy exports following Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

Mr Albanese, who is riding high in the polls and marks 100 days in power on Monday, backed the move by saying fossil fuels will be important for years to come and flippantly telling journalists 'you came here by car' to prove his point.

The Greens, teal independents and even some of his own supporters on social media slammed the decision, with some calling the way he justified it 'insulting'.

Writer and environmental activist Sean Doherty, who supported Mr Albanese during the election campaign, wrote a scathing Instagram post on Sunday blasting the decision and saying Mr Albanese had had a 'sh*t week'.

'Very disappointed that the climate wars are far from over. Talked a big game at the election, and then this week turned around and handed the gas gronks 46,000 sq km of new offshore exploration acreage to play with,' he wrote.

Writer and environmental activist Sean Doherty, who supported Mr Albanese during the election campaign, wrote a scathing Instagram post (above)

Doherty accused Mr Albanese of using former energy minister Angus Taylor's language by asking journalists whether they travelled by car.

'But it wasn't just them doing the bidding of their gas masters… it was the Angus Taylor gaslight talking points Albo wheeled out with then,' he wrote

'When challenged by a journo about the acreage release, he asked him whether he'd driven to the press conference in a car.'

Journalist and activist Rachel Withers slammed Mr Albanese for trying 'to pretend anyone proposing weaning our society off fossil fuels is demanding that we go cold turkey', and said this type of argument was more 'insulting' when it came from 'the new Labor PM, Ender of the Climate Wars'.

Doherty also criticised Mr Albanese for meeting News Corp co-chairman Lachlan Murdoch and the company's editors in Sydney on Wednesday alongside Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles and Foreign Minister Penny Wong.

Mr Albanese copped criticism on social media (above) for the gas drilling decision

The Murdoch press has not backed Labor at an election since Kevin Rudd and has notoriously adopted a hostile stance to climate change action.

'To cap the week off he snuck up to Holt Street for a secret meeting with the Murdochs. Now, what could that be about?? I'd like [to] think this was all part of a long game, but sadly it seems more about the fossil fuel industry's long game than his,' Doherty wrote.

The release of Commonwealth offshore waters comprises 10 areas across the Bonaparte, Browse, Carnarvon, and Gippsland basins off the coasts of the Northern Territory, Western Australia, Victoria, and the Ashmore and Cartier Islands.

Greens leader Adam Bandt blasted the move and said the decision flew in the face of the government's recent climate change laws, which enshrine a 43 per cent emissions reduction target by 2030.

'The ink isn't even dry on the climate legislation and the government is already undoing it,' he told ABC Radio on Friday.

Teal independents also voiced their opposition, with Zali Steggall (above) saying the move 'throws fuel on the fire of climate change'

'You don't end the climate wars by opening new coal, oil and gas projects.

'This is a move that will take us further away from a safe climate and one we will push to stop.'

Teal independents also voiced their opposition, with Zali Steggall saying the move 'throws fuel on the fire of climate change'.

Debate on the climate legislation is set to resume in the Senate when federal parliament sits in September.

While the government struck a deal with the Greens to get the legislation through the upper house, Mr Bandt said the party would continue to call for a moratorium on new coal and gas projects.

Despite infuriating the Greens and climate activists on his left flank, Mr Albanese is riding high in the polls with a Resolve Political Monitor poll last Tuesday showing Labor has lifted its primary vote to 42 per cent, from about 33 per cent ahead of the May 21 election.

The Coalition's primary vote is down to 28 per cent from 36 per cent.

These numbers fall short of the state’s targets of reducing emissions by 50 per cent by 2030 and net zero by 2050.

The Committee for Sydney, an urban policy think tank made up of a highly influential body of business leaders and infrastructure experts, has set out a series of proposals to halve carbon dioxide emissions by 2030.

The committee released its Decarbonising Sydney report on Monday unveiling plans to ban the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2027, and gas appliances by 2030.

'NSW's climate policies are leading the nation, but this research is a wakeup call that Sydney's not on track for net zero - we've got plenty of work to do,' committee spokesman Sam Kernaghan said.

Diesel and petrol cars are the biggest driver of emissions in the area and should be replaced completely by electric vehicles, according to the report.

A blanket ban on the petrol guzzlers would follow in the steps of the ACT, which plans to phase out all emission-producing vehicles by 2035.

Increasing the number of electric vehicles on the road is one recommendation along with no new gas connections and the electrification of taxpayer-owned schools, hospitals, housing and office blocks

'The NSW EV Strategy aims for electric vehicles to make up half of all new car sales by 2030, leading to approx. 15 per cent of the passenger fleet being electric,' the report states.

'Our Accelerated Net Zero Transition model shows we need a much faster ramping up: all new cars need to be electric by 2027, so EVs make up approx. 30 per cent of the passenger fleet by 2030 – twice as much as in the Steady Transition approach.'

The plan to ban petrol car sales in NSW by 2027 is more ambitious than other countries with Germany and the UK waiting until 2030 and California 2035.

The committee wants to increase the number of electric vehicles expected on the roads by 2030 from 470,000 to 850,000.

It also wants to replace all commercial and government fleets with electric vehicles by the same year.

'A key reason EV supply is limited in Australia is the lack of fuel standards, along with no future ban on new petrol/diesel vehicles,' the report states.

'A petrol and diesel car sales ban, announced well in advance, would also send a clear signal to industry that EV charging, servicing and supply chain networks need to be in place.'

The committee released its Decarbonising Sydney report on Monday revealing diesel and petrol cars are the biggest driver of emissions in the area (stock image)

The Zero Emissions Vehicle Strategy will see no fuel-powered cars available for purchase beyond 2035 in the ACT

The report advised the number of charging stations should be increased drastically to cut down on consumer 'range anxiety'.

The push adds to a proposal put forward by a Grattan Institute think tank to ban diesel trucks manufactured before 2003 in parts of Sydney and Melbourne by 2025.

The report claimed trucks made before 1996 emitted 60 times more pollution than vehicles sold after 2011.

'Since old trucks are so harmful, the largest capital cities should introduce low-emission zones to keep the most-polluting ones away from people,' the report stated.

On top of introducing more electric vehicles, the Committee for Sydney wants more coal plants to be closed in order to reach the 2030 emissions target.

No new gas connections from 2035 and no new gas appliances by 2030 are part of the proposed plan.

'Both come with big social, logistical and political challenges, but the reduced energy bills that come with electrifying transport and buildings will be worth it,' Mr Kernaghan said.

The report shows how making the switch to cleaner energy could reduce the cost of living pressures.

The modelling suggests that by 2050, solar-powered households could be saving $1,000 a year on energy bills on average, and running an EV could save another $1,250 per year.

A home battery could reduce those bills by a further $850 per year, and converting gas appliances to electric could save another $150 per year on average.

Endeavour Energy CEO Guy Chalkley is forecasting more than 65,000 electric vehicles will be on its network by 2027, and 1.3 million by 2040.

He said the current number of 12,000 home batteries Endeavour supports is expected to increase more than tenfold to over 140,000 by 2030, and businesses are looking at industrial solar to cut costs and meet sustainability targets.

Dexus executive Rob Sims says electrifying buildings, upgrading to more efficient air-conditioning, introducing EV charging stations and installing solar panels will reduce emissions.

But households and businesses will need help to make millions of decisions, and renters need to join the list of winners for it to work, the Decarbonising Sydney report says.

The report recommends expanding rental and apartment access to rooftop solar and battery storage, including community-scale batteries.

Speeding up the switch to solar hot water with subsidies for new equipment along with new tariffs and smart meters that reward households for their individual decisions is also backed.

Greater Sydney is urged to start planning for a faster conversion of trucks to battery cells and liquid hydrogen.

The push to stop selling diesel and petrol cars in NSW falls in line with plans by the ACT Government to phase out the sale of the vehicles by 2035 under its Zero Emissions Vehicle Strategy.

Transport accounts for about 60 per cent of the ACT's emissions, with the new program to accelerate its commitment to significantly reducing its carbon footprint.

Shane Rattenbury, a member of the Greens and the Minister of Emissions Reduction, revealed the full plan in July, which set targets of between 80 and 90 per cent of new cars being zero-emission within the decade.

Financial incentives will be introduced to help convince residents to trade in their petrol vehicles for clean models."

f5e677a9-09ee-40e1-a41f-8c0618cdb4b1,"In a paper recently published in Science, Professor Nele Meckler of the University of Bergen and colleagues argue that the climate between around 35 and 60 million years ago may have been considerably warmer than we thought. Their finding suggests that a given level of CO 2 might produce more warming than prior work indicated, and it hints that the ocean circulated differently during that warm, ice-free climate.

Their conclusions come from new measurements of carbon and oxygen isotopes found in the shells of tiny creatures, called benthic foraminifera or “forams,” that lived on the seafloor at the time. Earlier work with similar samples had estimated temperatures using oxygen isotopes—a technique that could be confused by changes in how much water was locked away in ice at the poles and, to a lesser extent, variations in ocean salinity. The new study used a technique that registers temperatures more reliably and produced much warmer numbers.

A newer, clearer thermometer

Benthic foram oxygen isotopes have been a mainstay of ancient global climate studies, with the latest most detailed record extending back 60 million years. Deep ocean temperatures reflect ocean surface temperatures over timescales longer than about 1,000 years because the global “conveyor belt” of ocean circulation turns over on that timescale. Oxygen isotopes in that water reflect ocean surface temperature, and by extension global climate, because water with the heavier isotope oxygen-18 is a bit harder to evaporate than water with oxygen-16; when the sea is warmer and there’s more evaporation, oxygen-18 builds up in the oceans.

This isotope buildup is calibrated to temperature, but that calibration requires knowing ocean salinity and how much water is locked up in ice caps. “The global [oxygen isotope] curve… has always had this semi-hidden uncertainty due to the dual influences of temperature and ice volume that we can now resolve using clumped isotopes,” said Sierra Petersen of the University of Michigan, who was not involved in Meckler’s study.

The clumped isotope method removes the need to make that assumption about how much water is locked away in ice because it simultaneously measures the levels of carbon-13 found in the same sample of calcium carbonate in a foram shell. Thermodynamics favors “clumping” of heavier isotopes in calcium carbonate in cold water, but as the water gets warmer, entropy increasingly exerts its influence, and the heavier isotopes become more scattered in the shell material. The degree of isotope clumping is calibrated to temperature in the lab for a variety of materials, enabling clumped isotope measurements to yield temperature measurements in deep time.

The new method indicates that between 57 and 52 million years ago, the North Atlantic abyss was about 20°C. That’s a big difference from the oxygen isotope data, which yielded temperatures of 12–14°C. “That's a whole lot warmer,” said Meckler. For comparison, today’s equivalent is around 1–2°C."

A group of scientists this week said they have discovered new evidence of how methane deposits stored deep in the seafloor can break free — and they are now trying to figure out what this could mean for our climate future. 10 steps you can take to lower your carbon footprint ArrowRight The research published Monday suggests a major destabilization of seafloor methane off the coast of Africa around 125,000 years ago, after a global shift in currents warmed the middle depths of the ocean there by 6.8 degrees Celsius, or 12.2 degrees Fahrenheit — a massive rise.

Several scientists who reviewed the study said they weren’t ready to raise major alarms about the planet’s ample stores of subsea methane in the form of what are called hydrates. While most experts agree that this methane could cause tremendous warming if it somehow hits the atmosphere, many say that the gas would be unleashed only slowly as the planet warms, and that the ocean itself would protect us by absorbing most methane before it can escape to the air.

Still, the new findings, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, underscore how little we still know about how the planet will respond to our uncontrolled greenhouse gas emissions — and how unpredictable that response may be.

The new sample of sediment unearthed from the seafloor paints a picture of tumultuous events during a period of Earth’s history around 125,000 years ago, called the Eemian. The era has often stirred scientists’ fears about the future, for while the Earth was not much warmer than it is today, seas were 20 feet or more higher. Some suspect the West Antarctic ice sheet may have collapsed at that time — and a few have even postulated superstorms powerful enough to lift boulders atop cliffs in the Bahamas.

The new research suggests another Eemian climate cascade. It would have begun with large pulses of meltwater from the Greenland ice sheet, which slowed down the circulation of the North Atlantic Ocean — a change that would have reverberated around the globe. As the ocean’s so-called conveyor belt slowed and less cold water made its way into its middle depths, the paper’s authors contend, the continental shelf of the Gulf of Guinea along the coast of Africa was bathed in sudden, strong warmth. This, in turn, destabilized methane that had previously been suspended beneath the seafloor.

The warming of the middle layer of the ocean during the era was “much stronger than previous model studies have assumed,” said Syee Weldeab, a paleoclimatologist at the University of California at Santa Barbara, who led the research along with colleagues at institutions in Germany, China and Australia.

“And then, the release of methane is strong and persistent over a longer time, to make it basically noticeable through the sediment, through the water column, and potentially, to the atmosphere,” Weldeab added.

Methane is more than 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide for the first 20 years after it is released into the atmosphere. And current emissions of methane from fossil fuel leakage, cattle and landfills, among other sources, are driving a major part of the Earth’s warming.

But there are also enormous quantities of natural methane locked away in the form of hydrates, buried in the mud of the Earth’s continental shelves. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that, at the low end, the amount of methane contained in hydrates around the globe is “more than 4000 times the amount of natural gas consumed in the USA in 2010.” Scientists and policymakers have begun eyeing hydrates not only because of climate change concerns, but also because they might be tapped as an energy source.

Hydrates form over long geological periods, largely the result of tiny marine organisms powering their bodies in the absence of oxygen and releasing methane as a byproduct. The methane fuses with water and forms icy deposits, which remain stable as long as there is enough pressure on them from the weight of the water above — and as long as the temperature remains cool enough.

But how can we possibly know what these hydrates did 125,000 years ago?

The new study is based on the evidence contained within a core of ocean sediment measuring more than 100 feet long that was extracted in the Gulf of Guinea, off the coast of Cameroon. Going deeper into the seafloor mud is the equivalent of going back in time, and scientists can use the shells of tiny organisms that died in those ancient waters and sediment — “microfossils,” Weldeab calls them — to infer the state of the environment in different eras.

Those shells contain evidence of the major ocean-warming event. They also show a strong increase in the prevalence of a certain variant of carbon, called an isotope, that these small organisms were busily molding into their shells. That anomaly, as Weldeab and colleagues interpret it, signals an environment full of methane.

But because the study could not directly measure ancient methane, the scientists are inferring its presence based on this “proxy” evidence — Weldeab’s specialty. Still, it all comes down to how you interpret the pattern of carbon atoms contained in shells buried in ancient mud.

Experts had mixed views of the research — and its implications.

“Carbon isotopes are tricky, there are hundreds of stories told about carbon isotope excursions, and some excursions which no one can even come up with explanations for,” said David Archer, a geoscientist at the University of Chicago who has written in the past that hydrates will probably emit some methane this century but it will not be “catastrophic.”

“Conclusions from data like this are always provisional, [and] become stronger if they are confirmed in multiple proxies,” Archer said.

Carolyn Ruppel, chief scientist of the Gas Hydrates Project at the U.S. Geological Survey, called the new work “a very provocative study” and praised it for containing “very elegant data.”

“This may have truly happened in this place at this time because of weakening of AMOC,” Ruppel said, referring to the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, a highly sensitive part of the global ocean circulation system.

But “I don’t think that on average, it changes our perspective,” Ruppel continued.

For instance, Ruppel said, scientists believe that some small fraction of the world’s subsea methane hydrates are already breaking down today, in response to the relatively modest ocean warming that we have seen so far. But “very little of that methane is reaching the sea-air interface,” Ruppel added.

Wei-Li Hong, a geochemist at Stockholm University, agreed and said the microfossil and isotope evidence is difficult to interpret. For instance, he said, the speed of the ocean’s currents can influence how much methane can accumulate in a particular spot for these tiny organisms to, in turn, incorporate it.

“Being a scientist, I think I should be open-minded,” Hong said. “I think everything is possible because I think that the problem with this debate is that no one is able to give definite evidence for one interpretation over the other.”

Even if these hydrates do come apart, the methane might not enter the atmosphere because of the protective layer of the ocean. The gas would still have to travel upward through waters half a mile or more deep. There are reasons to think that some or all of it may fuse with oxygen within the water column and lose its warming potency.

But Weldeab suggests that, at least 125,000 years ago, much of the methane could have escaped — in part because there was just so much of it.

“We find evidence there is methane release across the water column,” Weldeab said. “Starting from 1,300 meters, going up to the surface.”

Another key question is whether the methane breakdowns would have happened only in the Gulf of Guinea or whether they occurred all over the Earth.

“We and our colleagues should go out and see this in other areas to determine whether this was a local or more global event,” Weldeab said.

In the end, the study presents worrying evidence, but also leaves many unresolved questions. And the chain of causes that it posits — Greenland melts, oceans shift, newfound heat reaches the African coast thousands of miles away, and suddenly methane is mobile — may not play out in the same way today, even if it did all happen that way in the past. The Eemian is only an analogue — one of the closest we have for where we are now heading, but still imperfect.

Still, the newest theory about how the climate dominoes may fall underscores what the late Columbia University geoscientist Wallace Broecker famously observed as he studied the global ocean currents’ response to burning fossil fuels: “The climate system is an angry beast and we are poking it with sticks.”

6d8071f8-336f-4b17-aafd-b09f3d5bd09d,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has delivered a stark message: the US central bank will likely impose more large interest rate hikes in coming months and is resolutely focused on taming the highest inflation in four decades.

Powell also warned more explicitly than he has in the past that the Fed's continued tightening of credit will cause pain for many households and businesses as its higher rates further slow the economy and potentially lead to job losses.

""These are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation,"" he said in a high-profile speech at the Fed's annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole.

""But a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain.""

Investors had been hoping for a signal that the Fed might soon moderate its rate increases later this year if inflation were to show further signs of easing.

But the Fed chair indicated that that time may not be near.

After hiking its key short term rate by three-quarters of a point at each of its past two meetings - part of the Fed's fastest series of rate increases since the early 1980s - Powell said the Fed might ease up on that pace ""at some point"" - suggesting that any such slowing isn't near.

Powell said the size of the Fed's rate increase at its next meeting in late September - whether one-half or three-quarters of a percentage point - will depend on inflation and jobs data.

An increase of either size, though, would exceed the Fed's traditional quarter-point hike, a reflection of how severe inflation has become.

The Fed chair said that while lower inflation readings that have been reported for July have been ""welcome,"" ""a single month's improvement falls far short of what the Committee will need to see before we are confident that inflation is moving down"".

He noted that the history of high inflation in the 1970s, when the central bank sought to counter high prices with only intermittent rate hikes, shows that the Fed must stay focused.

""The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely"" lowering interest rates, he said.

""We must keep at it until the job is done.""

Powell's speech is the marquee event of the the Fed's annual economic symposium at Jackson Hole, the first time the conference of central bankers is being held in person since 2019 after it went virtual for two years during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Since March, the Fed has implemented its fastest pace of rate increases in decades to try to curb inflation, which has punished households with soaring costs for food, petrol, rent and other necessities.

The central bank has lifted its benchmark rate by 2 full percentage points in just four meetings, to a range of 2.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent.

Those hikes have led to higher costs for mortgages, car loans and other consumer and business borrowing."

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Republican leaders in Virginia said Friday they want to change the law so the state no longer follows California’s stringent rules for vehicle emissions.

Virginia is currently on a path toward adopting California’s new rules for transitioning to zero-emission vehicles because of 2021 legislation that involved adopting the West Coast state’s emissions standards, attorneys and state officials said this week. The legislation, intended to help address climate change , was a top priority of environmental advocates and passed at a time when Democrats were in full control of Virginia’s government.

But Republicans in the House of Delegates, who opposed the legislation and now control that chamber, and GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin said Friday they would push to unlink Virginia’s standards.

“House Republicans will advance legislation in 2023 to put Virginians back in charge of Virginia’s auto emission standards and its vehicle marketplace. Virginia is not, and should not be, California,” House Speaker Todd Gilbert said in a statement.

Youngkin said he was “already at work to prevent this ridiculous edict from being forced on Virginians.”

California regulators on Thursday approved a plan requiring all new cars, trucks and SUVs sold in the state to run on electricity or hydrogen by 2035, with one-fifth allowed to be plug-in hybrids. The policy doesn’t ban cars that run on gas, allowing drivers to keep their existing cars or buy used ones.

The policy approved by the California Air Resources Board is the world’s most stringent set of rules for transitioning to electric vehicles. It will require new charging infrastructure and a more robust energy grid, and is likely to reshape the U.S. auto market.

Virginia is among 17 states that have adopted some or all of California’s tailpipe emission standards that are stricter than federal rules. California, the nation’s most populous state, has had the authority to set its own for decades under a waiver from the federal Clean Air Act.

Victoria LaCivita, a spokeswoman for Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, said in a statement that the 2021 law bound Virginia to California’s regulations and that Miyares is hopeful the General Assembly repeals it.

Environmental attorneys also agreed that under current law, Virginia would have to get in line with California.

That’s a good thing, said Walton Shepherd, Virginia policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council. He called the 2021 “clean cars” bill the “single biggest climate action” Virginia has undertaken. Federal data show the transportation sector is Virginia’s largest source of heat-trapping carbon dioxide.

“It’s a really great development for consumers, relief from high gas prices and clean air,” he said of the new rules.

Trip Pollard, a senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, said automakers prioritize sending their electric vehicles to states that have adopted California’s standards, meaning better “consumer choice” for drivers who want an EV.

Pollard said it was “unfortunate” but not surprising that Republicans wanted to undo the law, given that they tried unsuccessfully to do so earlier this year.

“We certainly will be arguing strongly to members of both parties that this is something Virginia should stick with,” he said.

Democrats control the state Senate by a single vote. A caucus spokesperson had no immediate comment Friday beyond noting that every Democratic senator supported the bill in 2021."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Patrick T. Fallon/AFP via Getty Images Patrick T. Fallon/AFP via Getty Images

California wants to drive a stake into the heart of gas-powered vehicles.

State regulators approved a policy Thursday that will ban the sale of new gas cars by 2035 in what is the country's largest auto market.

It's part of an ambitious plan to fight climate change by accelerating the transition to an electric future, and it's a decision a handful of states are expected to follow.

Despite the strong demand for electric cars, sales made up only 3% of total car sales last year.

The race now is for automakers to increase the production of electric vehicles, but that alone won't be enough.

Analysts say the industry faces several challenges in ending sales of gas-powered cars by 2035.

Electric vehicles are still really expensive

The average price of an electric vehicle is currently $66,000 — well beyond the means of many people.

""That's not going to fit in a lot of people's monthly budgets at this point in time,"" says Jessica Caldwell, executive director of Insights at Edmunds. ""They [automakers] have to introduce the more expensive, more costly, higher-margin vehicles first to make the money to start to finance some of the lower-cost vehicles.""

Car companies like Chevrolet and General Motors are aiming to release more-affordable options in the coming years. A key provision of President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act also provides a revamped $7,500 tax credit when buying a new electric car, although it has a number of caveats.

But to make cars more affordable, electric vehicles will need to make batteries more cost-effective.

""The batteries are simply more expensive than the internal combustion engine,"" says Carla Bailo, president and CEO of the Center for Automotive Research. ""Most manufacturers are saying by 2025 batteries will be on par with the cost of an internal combustion engine and when that happens, that will definitely help bring the price down.""

However, making batteries cheaper presents another challenge.

China dominates the critical minerals market

China currently dominates the rare earth mineral market and the auto industry has long relied on the country to source EV batteries.

The Biden administration is pushing automakers to reduce their dependence on China, but that's easier said than done.

""Something in the order of about 90% of the lithium that's used in batteries is processed in China right now, which is not a desirable situation,"" says Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst with Guidehouse Insights.

And finding new sources or partners won't be easy.

""Obtaining minerals from places with which we have trade agreements is going to be the biggest challenge because there's huge competition for that,"" says Michelle Krebs, executive analyst with Cox Automotive. ""Everybody's scrambling to cut deals for the minerals.""

But even if companies are able to ramp up production, they could run into another problem.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Justin Sullivan/Getty Images

The EV infrastructure is still pretty limited

Not only are there too few charging stations across the country, many existing stations don't always work.

A recent survey by J.D. Power found that the limited availability and reliability of charging stations is a key factor holding people back from buying electric vehicles.

The federal government is spending $7.5 billion to expand the country's charging infrastructure.

But even if it gets there, it's not clear how much an already fragile and vulnerable electric grid can handle.

Then, there's another hurdle.

Adjusting the auto industry's workforce

Embracing an electric future and accelerating the mass adoption of electric vehicles will require automakers to adjust their workforce.

Companies will need engineers with a different set of skills for this transition.

""They're not going to be designing new transmissions, but instead they need people with the skills to design electric motors and electrical architectures,"" says Abuelsamid.

Analysts expect to see companies lay off some workers while hiring in departments geared toward electric vehicles in the coming years.

From ramping up production to revamping the workforce, the transition is unlikely to be a smooth process for buyers, drivers and — especially — the auto industry, but transitions rarely are.

""They're bumpy and I think there are going to be some things that are unpredictable,"" says Krebs. ""So buckle up."""

Certainly markets are still digesting Powell’s message that his resolve to raise rates and fight inflation is unshaken; yields on US two-year treasuries rose in trade in Asia on Monday to hit 3.46 per cent, the highest since 2007.

The belief that the Fed might not be a million miles from a pivot to a more accommodative policy stance had built in bond markets throughout July, but Monday’s sell-off (bond prices move in the opposite direction to yields) has erased those gains.

But Powell isn’t, or shouldn’t be, the only thing on the minds of investors."

The overall tone of Mr Powell’s speech was more hawkish than the markets expected and as such the Nasdaq plunged more than 2.77 per cent and the S & P 500 fell 1.89 per cent in early trading.

Investors reacted to the speech by extending the rise in shorter-date Treasury yields. The two-year note pushed as high as 3.44 per cent while the 10-year bond yield rose 7 basis points to 3.033 per cent.

Investors had probably not fully considered how much higher inflation will stay above the Fed’s 2 per cent target due to wage pressures and what that means for the central bank’s decisions on rates.

Mr Powell indicated that 2 per cent target was not negotiable.

“We are moving our policy stance purposefully to a level that will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 per cent,” he said.

Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, centre, takes a coffee break with attendees of the central bank’s annual symposium at Jackson Lake Lodge in Grand Teton National Park Friday. AP

Mr Powell said there was “not grounds for complacency, with inflation, having run well above our goal for some time.”

“While the lower inflation readings for July are certainly welcome. A single month’s improvement falls far short of what the committee will need to see before we are confident that inflation is moving down.”

“Our decision at the September meeting will depend on the totality of the incoming data and the evolving outlook,” he said.

Forceful action

“Restoring price stability will take some time and requires using our tools forcefully to bring demand and supply into better balance,” Powell said in remarks that were set to be live-streamed for the first time from inside the lodge where the event has been held since 1982.

Powell warned that higher sustained rates would bring some pain to households.

“While higher interest rates, slower growth, and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses,” he said.

Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance said another market correction could be around the corner if the Fed was setting a course for significantly higher rates than financial markets had priced in.

“If the Fed is going to raise interest rates until the US enters recession, then the stock market needs to be down 20-30 per cent from its prior peak, as that is the minimum that markets drop, on average, for an NBER-determined recession,” Mr Zaccarelli said.

Powell’s remarks at the retreat, which gathers top policymakers from around the world, come after Fed raised rates by 75 basis points at its last two meetings to leave the official Fed funds rate at 2.5 per cent.

Fed officials in June projected rates to rise to 3.4 per cent by the end of this year, and 3.8 per cent by end 2023. They will update those forecasts in September. Financial markets have the benchmark lending rate peaking under 4 per cent early next year.

Out of balance

A major determinant of the pace of rate increases will be the strength of wages and inflation. Mr Powell said the labour market was “clearly out of balance” with demand for workers “substantially” exceeding supply.

US unemployment rate matched a five-decade low of 3.5 per cent in July with payrolls fully recovering to pre-pandemic levels.

Ahead of Powell’s speech, several Fed officials emphasised the central bank is in no way done, with Kansas City Fed Chief Esther George noting that the destination of the federal funds rate may be higher than markets are currently priced for.

“We have to get interest rates higher to slow down demand and bring inflation back to our target,” said George, who votes on monetary policy this year."

The Nasdaq led declines among the three US benchmarks, weighed by high-growth technology stocks which tumbled after rallying the previous day in anticipation of Powell's scheduled speech to the Jackson Hole central banking conference in Wyoming.

The US economy will need tight monetary policy ""for some time"" before inflation is under control, Powell said at the event.

That means slower growth, a weaker job market and ""some pain"" for households and businesses, he added.

Investors knew further rate rises were coming and they have been divided between whether a 75-basis-point and a 50-basis-point hike by the Fed was coming next month.

However, recent data highlighting continued strength in the labour market, to offset two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth, had led to some speculating a more tempered pace of hikes could be forthcoming.

""The pushback is coming from the idea that it's not about the pace of hikes going forward and how they tighten financial conditions, it's about the duration of remaining at that restrictive policy stance,"" said Garrett Melson, portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers.

""That's the nuance they are trying to push forward and Powell was, maybe, a bit more explicit in that today. But if you've listened to other Fed speakers in the last couple of weeks, it's the same message.""

0c8b2bc7-81d5-420f-924b-0cce2e77884a,"The Fed has already embarked on the most aggressive campaign to raise interest rates since 1981 and is expected to take further action throughout at least the second half of 2022. Central banks across advanced and emerging economies have followed suit, grappling with their own inflation surges exacerbated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

But former officials and economists warn another big test of the Fed’s credibility will emerge in the next phase of tightening, when inflation has not yet slowed sufficiently but the economy starts to flash more obvious signs of weakness.

Distorted data

Powell, whose legacy will depend in large part on the outcome, must build consensus across what is likely to become a more divided central bank.

The Fed’s predicament stems from its early assessment that the consumer price surge triggered by supply chain disruption and trillions of dollars of pandemic-related fiscal stimulus was temporary. It was a view shared by most but not all economists to begin with, and one that Powell devoted the entirety of last year’s Jackson Hole speech to supporting.

Distorted data had concealed the strength of the labour market, which is now one of the tightest in history.

Viewing inflation through a “transitory” lens – a term Powell officially abandoned in November – laid the basis for a series of policy blunders that led to the Fed expanding its balance sheet long after additional support was necessary. It also waited until March before raising rates.

“We should have recognised last fall that this was a time to slip monetary policy on to the correct path,” said Randy Quarles, the Fed’s former vice-chair for supervision who left in late 2021. “Had we responded earlier, inflation would not have reached the level it is at now.”

The central bank was too wedded to the idea that “you can’t step on the gas and the brake pedal at the same time”, said Quarles, meaning officials felt obliged to hold off raising rates until they had stopped hoovering up Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities. Others thought the Fed should have started to “taper” its bond purchases sooner.

Economic milestones

Quarles, who now foresees the federal funds rate rising as high as 4 per cent and a “short and shallow” recession next year, said an interest rate increase as early as November would have been appropriate.

Powell also admitted last month that the guidance the central bank had provided in late 2020, in which it laid out the economic milestones that needed to be reached before it would stop easing policy, was too inflexible for an environment of such extreme uncertainty.

“I don’t think that that has materially changed the situation, but I have to admit, I don’t think I would do that again,” he said.

Heading into this year’s Jackson Hole conference, economists say the Fed has tried to correct many of its earlier mistakes, having “front-loaded” its interest rate increases and raised the benchmark policy rate from near-zero to a target range of 2.25 per cent to 2.50 per cent in just four months.

Most officials now expect rates to rise by at least another percentage point by the end of the year, with a third consecutive 0.75 percentage point rate increase under consideration for the September meeting. But concerns linger about the Fed’s resolve to continue squeezing the economy if unemployment climbs higher than expected. The other risk is that inflation is far harder to root out than is currently anticipated.

The fear is a redux of the 1970s, when the Fed oscillated between raising rates to stem price pressures and cutting them to prop up growth, failing to get inflation under control in the process. The central bank then had to slam on the brakes more forcefully, causing a far worse economic contraction than otherwise would have been the case.

“The bigger risk is that they reverse course too soon, not that they tighten for too long,” said Charles Plosser, who served as president of the Philadelphia Fed from 2006 to 2015. “The concern has to be, will they stick to their guns? Will they provide enough of a slowdown to actually bring inflation down, keep it down and restore the Fed’s credibility?”

While the Fed has framed its commitment to price stability as “unconditional”, officials — unlike most Wall Street economists — maintain that a recession is not a foregone conclusion.

At their most recent policy meeting, they also discussed nascent signs the economy is cooling and the risks of being heavy-handed with tightening, fanning fears that a more divided Fed will back off its inflation fight prematurely.

On Friday, Powell is set to underscore the central bank’s commitment to do what is needed to combat inflation, even if it determines it may soon be appropriate for the Fed to start implementing smaller rate rises.

“The Fed at this point cannot lose control of the narrative,” said Claudia Sahm, founder of Sahm Consulting and a former Fed economist. “They need to make really clear that they understand what the stakes are [and] what the potential very negative consequences of the path that they have set themselves on are.”

The eagerly anticipated comments sent major stock indexes plummeting as investors anticipated the Fed would continue its aggressive interest rate hikes. In doing so, the Fed hopes to tamp down inflation by slowing the economy — even amid fears the country could be barreling toward a recession if it isn’t in one already.

WASHINGTON — Despite signs that decades-high inflation might have peaked, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell delivered a blunt message Friday: The central bank’s fight to force down high prices is far from over, and it will “bring some pain” to consumers and businesses.

“We will keep at it until we are confident the job is done,” Powell said in a speech at an annual central banking conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo. His unusually strong and focused language dispelled any notion that the Fed would change course in the face of slower economic growth and a possible rise in the historically low unemployment rate.

“While higher interest rates, slower growth, and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses,” Powell warned. “These are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation. But a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain.”

Soaring prices for gas, food, and housing have hammered Americans this year as the economy struggles to recover from pandemic-related supply chain disruptions and the effects of sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. The Fed is the government’s main inflation fighter and, after criticism it was slow to react to inflation, has been aggressively raising interest rates this year to reduce demand by making borrowing more costly.

Shortly before Powell spoke, there were fresh indications the Fed’s interest rate hikes already are having the intended effect.

The Commerce Department said Friday that consumer spending growth slowed in July, driven by falling gas prices. The report also said the annual inflation rate as measured by the Fed’s preferred indicator, the personal consumption expenditures price index, declined to 6.3 percent from a four-decade high of 6.8 percent the previous month. Another inflation measure, the consumer price index, also was down in July from a 41-year high of 9.1 percent.

But Powell cautioned Friday it’s too soon to declare victory. He noted that the inflation rate remains well above the Fed’s 2 percent goal and “a single month’s improvement falls far short” of what central bank officials need to see to be confident it’s headed toward that target.

Boston College economist Brian Bethune said he believes inflation has peaked but likened Powell’s task to a surgeon awaiting confirmation his operation worked.

“You think the brain surgery is successful, but you don’t go and tell the relatives that everything went fantastic until the patient wakes up,” Bethune said.

Gregory Daco, chief economist at consulting firm EY-Parthenon, said that there have been previous “false dawns” during the pandemic in which inflation appeared to have peaked. And he pointed out that Powell alluded in his speech to errors that Fed officials made during the 1970s, when they pulled back from their inflation fight too soon and ultimately had to push interest rates close to 20 percent to get it under control.

“The Fed does not want [financial] markets to interpret the fact that there are early signs of a turnaround in inflation as an indication that the Fed will lift its foot off the brake,” Daco said.

Fed officials will meet next month and are expected to hike interest rates again, possibly by the same three-quarters of a percentage point they did in June and July. After the July meeting, Powell said another such hike might be coming in September. On Friday, he said that decision would depend on an analysis of the economic data.

Before that meeting, the government will release reports on August’s consumer price index and job growth. Those will follow data this month that showed the economy shrank from April through June, the second straight quarterly contraction after strong economic growth last year.

That’s typically a sign of recession, but an official determination on that from the private National Bureau of Economic Research could be months away. Many economists doubt the nation is in a recession given other data, particularly continued strong job creation, and there are signs economic growth has picked up this summer even if the pace is well below last year’s.

Powell was somewhat upbeat on the economy even as he warned of the potential pain of the inflation fight.

“The US economy is clearly slowing from the historically high growth rates of 2021, which reflected the reopening of the economy following the pandemic recession,” he said. “While the latest economic data have been mixed, in my view our economy continues to show strong underlying momentum.”

Powell has expressed confidence that the Fed could lower inflation without pushing the economy into a recession — a difficult maneuver known as a soft landing. But he was clear Friday that the Fed would not shrink from the inflation fight, whatever the cost, because the stakes are too high.

“Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone,” he said. “The burdens of high inflation fall heaviest on those who are least able to bear them.”

Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS, a financial markets research company, said Wall Street’s sell-off Friday showed investors might be scared of Powell’s resolve — and maybe everyone else should be, too.

“It’s not easy what he’s asking the public to accept,” Rupkey said of the strategy of Fed officials. “They’re flirting with policy that could prompt a deep downturn and job losses.”

496d022e-29c5-4555-bf42-1d7c44e0ddcd,"The California Air Resources Board voted Thursday afternoon to phase out the sale of new gasoline-powered cars in the Golden State.

The full effect of the binding decision will kick in more than 12 years from now, in 2035, when it will require most new cars and trucks sold in California to run exclusively on electricity or hydrogen.

The regulation will be phased in gradually until then, and it includes an exception for plug-in hybrids, allowing them to make up as much as 20% of new car sales even after 2035.

The regulation is the result of an executive order issued by Gavin Newsom back in 2020, as part of the California governor's efforts to fight climate change. The requirements will not ban combustion engine vehicles from roads nor will it halt any used car sales in the state, but it is expected to accelerate the transition to zero-emission vehicles. Crucially, 16 other states and Washington, D.C. look to California to set stricter emissions standards and could follow with similar rules.

In the meantime, the landmark policy lays out graduated requirements for California, mandating that zero-emission vehicles make up 35% of new car sales by 2026, and 68% by 2030.

The state still has a long way to go before ridding its roads of overly pollutive vehicles: As of 2021, 12.4% of new cars sold in California were either battery-electric vehicles or plugin-in hybrids, per the state's Energy Commission.

Though California leads the U.S. on the EV front, its rate of new plug-in sales trails Europe, which hit 22% in April. The EU is pursuing similar restrictions for 2035, and some countries, including Norway, aim to move faster.

Some legacy automakers, such as GM and Volvo, have already pledged to eventually go all electric, more or less aligning with younger firms like Tesla, Rivian, Lucid and Canoo. Other legacy businesses, like Toyota, have primarily focused on hybrids and are also teeing up future hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.

A ban by another name?

Gas-powered cars will still be welcomed on California roads even after all the sales requirements go into effect, the state's Air Resources Board emphasized in an email to TechCrunch. ""Not actually a ban,"" said a spokesperson for the regulator. ""The Advanced Clean Cars II regulation requires that all NEW vehicle sales be electric by 2035. Drivers with internal combustion vehicles at that time can keep them until the end of the vehicle life.""

Along similar lines, the Sierra Club, an environmental advocacy group, cast the new requirements as an essential ""transition"" rather than a ban. Regardless, the point is virtually the same — to restrict the sale of new gas vehicles because they're wreaking havoc on the climate and our health.

""This is very significant, because it sends a strong signal that we need to shift to zero-emission vehicles,"" said Katherine García, director of the Sierra Club's Clean Transportation for All campaign. ""This is common-sense action for protecting public health and for taking climate action.""

Building on this regulation will save lives, according to Dr. Lisa Patel, a clinical assistant professor of pediatrics at Stanford. ""It is a health imperative that all states eventually ban gas-powered cars,"" she said in an email to TechCrunch, pointing to a report from the American Lung Association. The lung health group estimated in March that a nationwide switch to EVs could save more than 100,000 lives over the next three decades.

""No child's health today should be ruined by breathing in the toxic fumes generated by our gas-powered fleets,"" Dr. Patel added, ""particularly when we have the technological solutions to avoid it."""

The California Air Resources Board will vote on an executive order enacted by Governor Gavin Newsom.

Mr Newsom said he would lead the revolution towards zero emissions in the transportation sector.

The government is offering low-income earners grants of up to $9,500 to encourage petrol-powered trade-ins for a new electric vehicle."
b574178e-669e-4ef1-935c-f82aa11c3df6,"The proposed regulations would set annual targets for boosting that percentage, starting at 35 per cent in 2026 and hitting 68 per cent in 2030. Plug-in hybrids, which switch between electricity and gas, and hydrogen fuel-cell cars would also count toward those goals.

California already has its own clean-vehicle incentive program, offering rebates of as much as $US7000 ($10,000) toward the purchase of zero-emission vehicles, although cars costing more than $US45,000 don’t qualify.

The move would dovetail with President Joe Biden’s efforts to push electric car sales. The Inflation Reduction Act he signed last week includes tax credits of up to $US7500 to EV buyers, although income restrictions apply.

And last year’s infrastructure law included $US5 billion to build a nationwide network of charging stations along major highways, to convince drivers they won’t get stranded without power on a trip if they make the switch.

While most automakers have announced plans to ramp up the production of EVs, the industry has expressed concern about getting locked into specific timelines for their adoption and that many consumers may not be ready to ditch petrol.

Electrics made up less than 6 per cent of new car sales in the first half of this year, according to the Edmunds automotive information service. And EV prices, already higher than petrol-powered cars, are rising as the war in Ukraine, supply chain problems and rising demand make the metals inside their rechargeable batteries more expensive.

The average sales price for an EV in July was nearly $US62,900, according to Edmunds, compared with $US47,200 for all vehicles.

“It’s a worthy goal, but maybe unrealistic given the charging infrastructure and likely increasing demand for power,” Brian Moody, executive editor for Kelley Blue Book and Autotrader, said in an emailed statement.

Still, Edmunds analyst Jessica Caldwell said on Wednesday that the industry should be able to meet California’s goals. “If automakers can pick up production, sufficient investments are made in charging infrastructure and the power grid, and financial incentives can be made more available, this milestone should be achievable—if not surpassable,” said Ms Caldwell, the company’s executive director of insights.

d490ed9f-d265-4659-a861-24c0d56c5e43,"California is Expected to Enact a Ban on Petrol-Powered Vehicles Today

In a drastic step to significantly reduce fossil fuel emissions, California is expected to ban the sale of new petrol-powered vehicles by 2035. It’s a huge move from a state that buys the most trucks and cars in the entire country, and which is often a national trendsetter for environmental standards.

“It’s ambitious, it’s pioneering, it’s what we must do if we’re going to leave this planet better for future generations,” Lauren Sanchez, senior climate adviser to Newsom, said during a conference call this week, as reported by Axios.

The California Air Resources Board is set to vote on the measure Thursday afternoon. If passed, the ban will be enacted in phases over the next 13 years: 35% of new cars sold by 2026 must be petrol-free, 68% of cars sold by 2030 must be petrol-free, and by 2035, 100% of new cars sold must be petrol-free. The ruling will not affect cars that are currently on California’s roads, just new cars that will be sold in the future.

The vote comes two years after Governor Gavin Newsom signed an executive order that banned the sale of cars with internal combustion engines. This is despite the fact that California is the second largest consumer of petrol in the country according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The state is tackling car-based emissions because 50% of California’s greenhouse gas emissions come from the transportation sector, according to California’s Energy Commission. Transportation also makes up about 90% of the state’s diesel particulate matter pollution, which is exhaust from trucks, buses, and other vehicles with diesel engines. Long-term exposure to this form of pollution is connected to cardiovascular and respiratory health issues. The state’s lawmakers site this, and long term climate impacts for their push to change car standards.

“For too many decades, we have allowed cars to pollute the air that our children and families breathe. Californians shouldn’t have to worry if our cars are giving our kids asthma,”said Governor Newsom in a 2020 press release about the proposed ban. “Our cars shouldn’t make wildfires worse – and create more days filled with smoky air. Cars shouldn’t melt glaciers or raise sea levels threatening our cherished beaches and coastlines.”

And though California is the country’s largest car market, it’s also a growing market for electric cars. The state accounts for 39% of all EVs and has the highest rate of electric vehicle adoption, but those cars only make up 2% of all the cars on the road in California, Axios reported. There is hope for the transition, especially because many states often follow California’s lead in auto emission standards.

Other efforts have been proposed in the state to curb car-based emissions, mitigate climate change, and improve public health. This past June, L.A. Councilman Paul Koretz proposed a ban on new petrol stations in the city. The proposal was inspired after the city of Petaluma, California became the first place in the U.S. to ban new stations."
cf6b3639-7e3a-4e4e-9ef7-0dc840ebd94f,"California, the nation's most populous state and its largest market for automobiles, is expected to implement a new rule this week to ban the sale of gasoline-powered cars starting in 2035 in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change.

The rule, which is to be issued by the California Air Resources Board on Thursday, mandates that in 13 years, 100% of new cars sold in the state will produce zero emissions, the New York Times reported Wednesday. Currently, just 12% of the automobiles sold in California are electric vehicles.

“The climate crisis is solvable if we focus on the big, bold steps necessary to stem the tide of carbon pollution,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement released Wednesday.

Last year, Newsom issued an executive order that tasked the California Air Resources Board with drafting regulations to achieve the goal of phasing out the sale of new gas cars in the state by 2035.

“This is the most impactful step our state can take to fight climate change,” Newsom said in a statement at the time. “For too many decades, we have allowed cars to pollute the air that our children and families breathe. Californians shouldn’t have to worry if our cars are giving our kids asthma. Our cars shouldn’t make wildfires worse — and create more days filled with smoky air. Cars shouldn’t melt glaciers or raise sea levels threatening our cherished beaches and coastlines.”

The Air Resources Board rule set to go into effect on Thursday is the result of Newsom’s order. Board member Daniel Sperling told CNN that he was “99.9%” confident that the measure will pass.

While the rule bans the sale of new gas passenger automobiles by 2035 in the state, it doesn't prevent Californians from owning or selling used gasoline-powered vehicles. The Air Resources Board is also in the process of readying regulations that would prohibit the sale and operation of gas- and diesel-powered trucks by 2045, but those restrictions will not go into effect on Thursday.

At least some states are expected to follow California’s lead on limiting new gas-powered cars, potentially spurring the transition from fossil fuel sources of energy to renewables. Climate scientists have long warned that more steps are urgently needed to avert the worst consequences of climate change.

The transportation sector represents the largest single contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S., according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

“Burning fossil fuels like gasoline and diesel releases carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere. The buildup of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases like methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) is causing the Earth’s atmosphere to warm, resulting in changes to the climate we are already starting to see today,” the EPA says on its website.

“Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transportation account for about 27 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, making it the largest contributor of U.S. GHG emissions,” the EPA continues. “Between 1990 and 2020, GHG emissions in the transportation sector increased more in absolute terms than any other sector.”

In California, a massive state linked by an expansive highway system, transportation accounts for 50% of emissions, Newsom has noted. Released in 2020, California’s Fourth Climate Change Assessment painted a grim picture of what the state could expect unless global action was taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

“Emerging findings for California show that costs associated with direct climate impacts by 2050 are dominated by human mortality, damages to coastal properties, and the potential for droughts and mega-floods,” the report stated. “The costs are in the order of tens of billions of dollars. If global greenhouse gas emissions are reduced substantially from the current business-as-usual trajectory, the economic impacts could be greatly reduced.”

The legal authority for the new California rule on gas cars is a byproduct of President Biden’s restoration of a Clean Air Act waiver that gave the state the ability to set its own automobile pollution and mileage standards. But 17 Republican-led states are challenging that waiver in a lawsuit before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Should the waiver be overturned, California's new rule would be invalidated.

The automobile market is already quickly moving in the direction of the goal laid out in the California rule. What used to be known as the “Big Three” U.S. automakers — General Motors, Ford and Daimler Chrysler — have already pledged to transition their fleets to electric vehicles by 2035, but the new rule would not exempt other automakers.

In June, at a public hearing in Sacramento on the emerging new rule on gas cars, automobile industry representatives voiced concern about meeting a 2035 deadline.

“Subaru fully supports an electric net carbon net zero carbon future, but today’s advanced clean cars proposal aims to set a very challenging path for the U.S. auto industry,” David Barker, environmental activities manager for North American Subaru, said at the meeting, the Times of San Diego reported. “There are very real challenges in meeting consumer demand while at the same time overcoming supply chain disruptions and limited access to critical help. These challenges are amplified for small manufacturers like Subaru.”

This month’s passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest climate bill in U.S. history, will also have a profound effect on spurring the transition to renewable sources of energy. But California’s rule goes further than offering incentives, outlawing the sale of new passenger cars on a firm date."
c3274b4c-25d4-44cf-8579-8982b57b22ea,"Projections of heat stress

To quantify the degree to which climate change will increase human heat stress, we first need probabilistic projections of global mean temperature change driven by anthropogenic CO 2 emissions. Figure 1a shows the probability density functions of atmospheric CO 2 concentrations in the years 2050 and 2100. These were produced using a joint Bayesian model of change in population, Gross Domestic Product, and carbon intensity by country11,12.

Fig. 1: Projections of CO 2 emissions and global mean temperature change through 2100. a shows probabilistic projections of atmospheric CO 2 concentrations in 2050 and 2100. b shows a probability distribution of transient global climate sensitivity written in terms of °C warming per 100 ppm of atmospheric CO 2 change. c shows the convolutions of the probability distributions in a, b, which yields a probability distribution of global mean temperature change (relative to the 1850–1900 baseline) in 2050 and 2100. Full size image

While other greenhouse gases contribute to climate change on decadal to centennial timescales, atmospheric CO 2 concentrations are highly correlated with global mean temperature change across a variety of climate change scenarios (see Table S1). We use linear best-fit regression to calculate the relationship between global mean temperature change and atmospheric CO 2 concentrations in each of the 23 climate models that participated in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). The probability distribution of this linear relationship, which we refer to as the transient global climate sensitivity, is shown in Fig. 1b. The uncertainty in transient climate sensitivity is similar to that reported in other studies13 and reflects the different model physics and parameterizations that lead to various amounts of global warming across climate models forced by the same amount of anthropogenic emissions.

Anthropogenic emissions have already warmed the planet by roughly 1.0 °C as of 2000–2020 relative to 1850–1900 baseline14,15. Using the probability density functions in Fig. 1a, b along with the 1 °C warming already observed, we generate the probability density functions of global mean temperature change in 2050 and 2100, all relative to the 1850–1900 baseline used by the IPCC16, shown in Fig. 1c. For 2050, the [5, 50, 95] percentile changes in global mean temperature are [1.5, 1.8, 2.3] °C while for 2100 these percentiles are [2.1, 3.0, 4.3] °C. These projections indicate that there is only a 0.1% chance of limiting global average temperature change to the Paris Climate Agreement aspirational goal of 1.5 °C by 2100. Note that the full statistical model does not explicitly take into account the possibility of more aggressive policy actions such as negative emissions technologies and also does not consider overshoot strategies to achieve particular global warming targets.

To connect these probabilistic projections for the global mean temperature change to changes in local Heat Index, we calculate the ratio of local changes in temperature to global mean temperature change for each calendar month for each of the climate models and then averaged the results across the 23 climate models that we analyzed. This pattern scaling approach allows our probabilistic projections of global mean temperature change shown in Fig. 1c to be applied anywhere in space. The local mean temperature change for each month at each place in space is the product of the global mean temperature change in the scaling ratio S T shown in Fig. S1. The same procedure is applied to render the local change in relative humidity in each calendar month (see the scaling patterns S RH in Fig. S2). In Fig. 2, we show the regional changes in local temperature associated with the median global average temperature change (3.0 °C) projected for the end of this century. Changes over land regions are typically 5 °C, with greater increases in the Arctic.

To understand how the Heat Index changes with global warming, we first calculate the daily maximum Heat Index from 1979 to 1999 using daily observations of maximum temperature and monthly average observations of specific humidity (see Supplementary Methods). We then use six different scenarios of global mean temperature change that correspond to the [5,50,95] percentiles in 2050 and 2100 calculated from the PDF shown in Fig. 1c and the scaling patterns for temperature and relative humidity (Figs. S1 and S2) to calculate the change in the climatological mean temperature and relative humidity at each place in space for each calendar month in each of the six scenarios. This method of relating global to local mean temperature change takes advantage of a well-known pattern of temperature change seen across several generations of climate model ensembles17 and the (negative) correlation between global temperature and terrestrial relative humidity change18.

We applied the relevant local changes in climatological temperature and relative humidity to the observed daily temperature and relative humidity (1979–1998) for each of the six climate change scenarios we considered, and then used these records as inputs to calculate the Heat Index according to the Rothfusz equation19. This procedure takes into account uncertainty in both projected CO 2 emissions and climate sensitivity, but not the small uncertainty associated with regional uncertainty in global climate change projections (see “Methods” and Figs. S3–S5). Figures 3 and 4 show the average days per year where dangerous and extremely dangerous Heat Index thresholds are exceeded under six climate change scenarios, as well as in the observational record from 1979 to 1998 (see “Methods”).

Fig. 3: Projections of dangerous Heat Index values. a shows the average number of days per year when the dangerous Heat Index threshold was exceeded in the historical record (1979–1998). b–g show the same quantity under the various climate change scenarios noted in each panel. Full size image

Fig. 4: Projections of extremely dangerous Heat Index values. Same as Fig. 3a–g but for exceedances of the extremely dangerous Heat Index threshold. Red contours in all panels outline regions where the extremely dangerous Heat Index threshold is exceeded more than once per year on average. Full size image

Over the period 1979–1998, the dangerous Heat Index threshold was exceeded on roughly 5% of the days in each year in the tropics and subtropics (between 30°S and 30°N), and for 10–15% of the days in each year in subtropical Africa, the Indian subcontinent, and the Arabian peninsula (Fig. 3a). In the midlatitudes, the dangerous Heat Index threshold was exceeded less often; in many places, these exceedances represented extreme events that occurred less than once per year in the 20-year record we examined. Exceedances of the extremely dangerous Heat Index threshold were rare across the globe in the 1979–1998 record (see Fig. 4a). The most frequent exceedances of the extremely dangerous Heat Index threshold were concentrated in the coastal regions of the Arabian peninsula and Northern India and occurred between once and three times per year in the historical record.

The global warming scenarios present troubling projections of increasing heat stress driven by anthropogenic emissions. In the tropics and subtropics, where the dangerous Heat Index threshold was typically exceeded on less than 15% of the days in each year between 1979 and 1998, we project that, by 2050, many people living in these regions will likely experience dangerous Heat Index values on between one-quarter and one-half of all the days in each year (Fig. 3c). By 2100, the median projection is that most regions in the tropics and subtropics will exceed the dangerous Heat Index threshold on most of the days in each year (Fig. 3f). Many regions in the midlatitudes will experience dangerous Heat Index values on between 15 and 90 days each year—in some places, this represents an order of magnitude increase in the frequency of exposure to dangerous heat stress from the 1979–1998 period.

The Heat Index rarely exceeds the extremely dangerous threshold in the current climate (Fig. 4a). In the median projection for 2100 (Fig. 4f) extremely dangerous heat stress will be a regular feature of the climate in sub-Saharan Africa, parts of the Arabian peninsula, and much of the Indian subcontinent. The extremely dangerous Heat Index threshold is likely to be exceeded on more than 15 days in each year by the end of the century in these regions, this will likely require massive adaptation measures for a large number of people. In our 95th percentile projection, which corresponds to high emissions and high climate sensitivity (see Fig. 4g), the Heat Index will exceed extremely dangerous levels on between 15 and 25% of all days in each year in some tropical and subtropical regions.

Chicago—a case study

As an example from the midlatitudes, we turn to Chicago; a major urban center whose history illustrates the dangers of extremely high temperatures. An extreme drought swept the United States during the summer of 1988, causing billions of dollars in damages to the agriculture sector across the United States20. During the drought, Dr. James Hansen gave congressional testimony that human-induced increases in greenhouse gases could increase the probability of extreme events such as summer heat waves. These events marked a turning point in the public understanding of climate change.

During the 1988 heat wave, the Heat Index in Chicago was 5°F higher than average over the 1979–1989 period, but the 103°F “dangerous” threshold was never exceeded. Seven years later, in 1995, a heat wave devastated Chicago and caused nearly 800 excess deaths21. This event consisted of 4 consecutive days (July 12–15) when the Heat Index exceeded 100°F. Such an event (4 consecutive days of maximum Heat Index >100°F) occurred only twice in the 1979–1998 record, both times in 1995, but the other 1995 event had a lower average intensity and occurred later in the summer.

By randomly sampling 1000 scenarios of global mean temperature changes from the distribution shown in Fig. 1c and using the local scaling patterns for Chicago’s place in space, we quantify the average change to Chicago’s daily Heat Index record by 2100. To do this, we augmented the 1979–1998 record of temperature and relative humidity in the same manner as was done in Figs. 3 and 4 (see “Methods”).

The 1979–1998 record shows that a daily Heat Index of 100°F was not exceeded in 11 out of 20 years. The same 20-year record modified by the median projections of temperature and relative humidity changes for the end of this century has at least one exceedance of this threshold each year. Further, heat waves like the kind that Chicago experienced in 1995 are projected to become a regular occurrence by the end of the century in our median projection: two 4-day periods with daily maximum Heat Index >100°F were found in the 20-year historical record (1979–1998); our median projection shows 32 such events in a 20-year period at the end of this century. This 16-fold increase in the number of potentially dangerous heat waves points to the kind of societal adaptation required to combat these phenomena in the midlatitudes. This order of magnitude increase in the number of heat waves in a 20-year record is reflected in our median projection of the number of days per year where the dangerous Heat Index threshold is exceeded. In the 1979–1998 record, the dangerous threshold (103°F) was exceeded four times (all in 1995), while an average of 11 exceedances of this threshold each year is likely by 2100."

The record-breaking heat events of recent summers will become much more common in places like North America and Europe.

The study looks at the “heat index,” which measures the impact of heat on the human body.

A dramatic increase in deadly heat waves is now probably inevitable, a study published Thursday says.

The authors say there's still hope that global temperature increases resulting from human-caused climate change can be curbed, which would avert even more catastrophic heat in some areas on Earth.

But even if the global temperature goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change are met, study authors warn that heat waves are destined to become more prevalent in coming decades.

""The frequency of extreme heat waves is likely to increase by 3 to 10 times by the end of the century, depending on where you live in the U.S.,"" study lead author Lucas Vargas Zeppetello told USA TODAY.

The authors say their results highlight the need to reduce future greenhouse gas emissions and to protect populations, especially outdoor workers, against dangerous heat.

Heat already kills more Americans each year than any other weather hazard, including hurricanes, tornadoes and floods, according to the National Weather Service.

Record-breaking heat to become more common

The findings suggest carbon dioxide emissions from human activity could drive increases in exposure to extreme temperatures in the coming decades, even if global warming is limited to 2 degrees C, in line with the Paris Agreement.

“The record-breaking heat events of recent summers will become much more common in places like North America and Europe,” said Vargas Zeppetello, who did the research as a doctoral student at the University of Washington and is now a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard University.

High temperatures pose a threat to public health, with extreme heat contributing to heat cramps, heat exhaustion and chronic illnesses, according to the study.

""This is especially dangerous for hot and humid places like the South and Eastern Seaboard, but we've seen the consequences of extreme heat on the West Coast as well, so there really is no place in the U.S. where this will not be an issue,"" Vargas Zeppetello said.

EXTREME HEAT:Extreme heat waves may be our new normal, thanks to climate change. Is the globe prepared?

People in equatorial regions will suffer even more

The forecast is even more ominous in other parts of the world:

“For many places close to the equator, by 2100 more than half the year will be a challenge to work outside, even if we begin to curb emissions,"" Vargas Zeppetello said.

In a worst-case scenario in which emissions remain unchecked until 2100, “extremely dangerous” conditions, in which humans should not be outdoors for any amount of time, could become common in countries closer to the equator – notably in India and sub-Saharan Africa.""

FACT CHECK:Global warming caused by human activity, not solar winds or weakened magnetic field

Dangerous heat index possible

The study looks at the “heat index,” which measures the effect of heat on the human body. A “dangerous” heat index is defined by the Weather Service as 103 degrees. An “extremely dangerous” heat index is 124 degrees, which is considered unsafe to humans for any amount of time.

According to study co-author David Battisti, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Washington, the number of days with dangerous levels of heat in the southeastern and central U.S. will more than double by as soon as 2050.

""It’s extremely frightening to think what would happen if 30 to 40 days a year were exceeding the extremely dangerous threshold,” Vargas Zeppetello said. “These are frightening scenarios that we still have the capacity to prevent. This study shows you the abyss, but it also shows you that we have some agency to prevent these scenarios from happening.""

What’s considered officially “dangerous heat” in coming decades will likely hit much of the world at least three times more often as climate change worsens, according to a new study.

In much of Earth’s wealthy mid-latitudes, spiking temperatures and humidity that feel like 103 degrees (39.4 degrees Celsius) or higher -- now an occasional summer shock — statistically should happen 20 to 50 times a year by mid-century, said a study Monday in the journal Communications Earth & Environment .

By 2100, that brutal heat index may linger for most of the summer for places like the U.S. Southeast, the study’s author said.

And it’s far worse for the sticky tropics. The study said a heat index considered “extremely dangerous” where the feels-like heat index exceeds 124 degrees (51 degrees Celsius) — now something that rarely happens — will likely strike a tropical belt that includes India one to four weeks a year by century’s end.

“So that’s kind of the scary thing about this,” said study author Lucas Zeppetello, a Harvard climate scientist. “That’s something where potentially billions of people are going to be exposed to extremely dangerous levels of heat very regularly. So something that’s gone from virtually never happening before will go to something that is happening every year.”

Zeppetello and colleagues used more than 1,000 computer simulations to look at the probabilities of two different levels of high heat -- heat indexes of 103 degrees (39.4 Celsius) and above 124 degrees (51 Celsius), which are dangerous and extremely dangerous thresholds according to the U.S. National Weather Service . They calculated for the years 2050 and 2100 and compared that to how often that heat happened each year across the world from 1979 to 1998.

The study found a three- to ten-fold increase in 103-degree heat in the mid-latitudes even in the unlikely best-case scenario of global warming limited to only 3.6 degrees (2 degrees Celsius) since pre-industrial times -- the less stringent of two international goals.

There’s only a 5% chance for warming to be that low and that infrequent, the study found. What’s more likely, according to the study, is that the 103-degree heat will steam the tropics “during most days of each typical year” by 2100.

ADVERTISEMENT

Chicago hit that 103 degree heat index level only four times from 1979 to 1998. But the study’s most likely scenario shows Chicago hitting that hot-and-sticky threshold 11 times a year by the end of the century.

Heat waves are one of the new four horsemen of apocalyptic climate change, along with sea level rise, water scarcity and changes in the overall ecosystem, said Zeppetello, who did much of the research at University of Washington state during the warming-charged 2021 heat wave that shattered records and killed thousands.

“Sadly, the horrific predictions shown in this study are credible,” climate scientist Jennifer Francis of the Woodwell Climate Research Center, who was not part of the study team, said in an email. “The past two summers have provided a window into our steamy future, with lethal heat waves in Europe, China, northwestern North America, India, the south-central U.S., the U.K., central Siberia, and even New England. Already hot places will become uninhabitable as heat indices exceed dangerous thresholds, affecting humans and ecosystems alike. Areas where extreme heat is now rare will also suffer increasingly, as infrastructure and living things are ill-adapted to the crushing heat.”

The study focuses on the heat index and that’s smart because it’s not just heat but the combination with humidity that hurts health, said Harvard School of Public Health professor Dr. Renee Salas, who is an emergency room physician.

“As the heat index rises, it becomes harder and harder to cool our bodies,” Salas, who wasn’t part of the research team, said in an email. “Heat stroke is a potentially deadly form of heat illness that occurs when body temperatures rise to dangerous levels.”

The study is based on mathematical probabilities instead of other climate research that looks at what happens at various carbon pollution levels. Because of that, University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann is more skeptical of this research. It also doesn’t take into account landmark U.S. climate legislation that President Joe Biden signed earlier this month or new efforts by Australia , he said.

“The obstacles at this point are political and no statistical methods, regardless of how powerful or sophisticated can predict whether we will garner the political will to overcome them,” Mann said in an email. “But there is reason for cautious optimism.”

d99bec13-396d-4cd5-9fb9-9d30c7e5e0f1,"Tropical areas will be affected the most due to their location, experts say

Despite efforts by major Western nations to combat climate change, the frequency of heat waves is expected to increase, according to a study released Thursday.

By 2100, over a billion people living in tropical and subtropical regions will annually experience temperatures that exceed dangerous heat index levels, the metric that measures heat exposure in human beings, according to the report in the Communications Earth & Environment journal.

The study found that people living in sub-Saharan Africa, India and the Arabian Peninsula will be exposed to dangerous heat index levels for most days of the year.

According to the National Weather Service, anything between 103 degrees and 124 degrees Fahrenheit is considered part of the dangerous heat index, while indexes 125 degrees Fahrenheit or higher are considered extremely dangerous.

Extreme heat can cause health issues, from fatigue to life-threatening problems such as heat strokes.

The Paris Climate Agreement, the U.N.-sponsored accord to help slow the effects of climate change, has a goal to stop the global temperature from reaching 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, with a goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Even if the goal is met, it's still not enough to prevent areas of the tropics and subtropics from experiencing dangerous heat levels, according to the report.

""The climate science community, for quite a while, has understood that the Paris agreement's goal is going to be very difficult to achieve based on the warming that's already [happened],"" Lucas Zeppetello, Ph.D., an earth science fellow at Harvard University and one of the authors of the study, told ABC News.

If countries manage to meet the goal, crossing the dangerous heat index threshold will be up to 10 times more common by 2100 in the U.S., Western Europe, China and Japan, while it could double in the tropics, resulting in more than one billion of people experiencing up to 124-degree temperatures by 2100, according to the study.

Tropical and sub-tropical areas will be affected the most due to their location, Zeppetello said.

Zeppetello doesn't think humanity is past the point of no return, as measures can be taken to address the problem, but warned that things would get worse without action.

""The difference between the fifth percentile, which is a world where we get climate emissions under control, is just vastly different from a world in which we don't do that,"" he said.

According to the report, there's a 0.1% chance of limiting the global average temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century, with the mean temperature headed toward 2 degrees Celsius by 2050.

""It's extremely frightening to think what would happen if 30 to 40 days a year were exceeding the extremely dangerous threshold,"" Zeppetello said in a statement. ""These are frightening scenarios that we still have the capacity to prevent.

'For many places close to the equator, by 2100 more than half the year will be a challenge to work outside, even if we begin to curb emissions.

'Our study shows a broad range of possible scenarios for 2100. This shows that the emissions choices we make now still matter for creating a habitable future.'

The study looked at a combination of air temperature and humidity known as the 'heat index' that measures heat exposure on the human body.

A 'dangerous' heat index is defined by the National Weather Service as 103°F (39.4°C), while an 'extremely dangerous' heat index is 124°F (51°C), deemed unsafe to humans for any amount of time.

'These standards were first created for people working indoors in places like boiler rooms – they were not thought of as conditions that would happen in outdoor, ambient environments. But we are seeing them now,' Zeppetello said.

The study looked at historical data, population projections, economic growth and carbon intensity (the amount of carbon emitted for each dollar of economic activity) to predict the likely range of future CO2 concentrations.

The top panel shows the historical record for 'dangerous' days per year, with a heat index above 103°F. The left column shows the range of dangerously hot days in 2050, with 10 times more 'dangerous' days in the southeastern US and more than 100 'dangerous' days in parts of South America, Africa, India and Australia. The right column shows the broader range of possibilities for 2100. The bottom right shows the worst-case scenario, with dangerous conditions for much of the year in South America, central Africa and South Asia. (Lower values in sub-Saharan Africa and India are because they experience “extremely dangerous” conditions.)

Record-breaking heatwaves have occurred in multiple places this summer, from the UK to Spain, Delhi in India and the Pacific Northwest in the US. Pictured, a dry bed of a pond amid the ongoing heatwave, in New Delhi, India on June 27, 2022

They then considered how this could change the heat index and increase global exposure to dangerous environments in the coming decades.

They estimated that there is only a 0.1 per cent chance of limiting global average warming to 1.5°C (2.7°F) by 2100, in line with the Paris Agreement.

Instead, they predicted that the change in global mean temperatures will likely approach 2°C (3.6°F) by 2050.

They also found that by 2100, many people living in tropical regions – such as India and sub-Saharan Africa – will be exposed to dangerously high heat levels during most days of each typical year.

Additionally, deadly heatwaves could happen every year in the mid-latitudes, located between the two tropics and the polar circles.

For example, the authors predicted a 16-fold increase in the occurrence of dangerous heatwaves in Chicago.

'The number of days with dangerous levels of heat in the mid-latitudes, including the southeastern and central US, will more than double by 2050,' said co-author David Battisti, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Washington.

'Even for the very low-end estimates of carbon emissions and climate response, by 2100 much of the tropics will experience ""dangerous"" levels of heat stress for nearly half the year.'

Even if countries manage to meet the Paris Agreement goal of keeping warming to 2°C (3.6°F), crossing the 'dangerous' threshold on the heat index will be three to 10 times more common by 2100 in the US, Western Europe, China and Japan.

Also by 2100, a 'dangerous' temperature of 103°F (39.4°C) will be two times more common in countries that are nearer the equator, such as India.

'These countries have fairly high rates of dangerous days in the current climate, which is why in absolute terms they'll have many more in the future, but in percentage terms its a smaller increase,' Zeppetello told MailOnline.

The tropics are regions of Earth that lie between the latitude lines of the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn (highlighted in red)

In a worst-case scenario where emissions remain unchecked until 2100, 'extremely dangerous' conditions, where humans shouldn't be outdoors for any time, could become common in countries neat the equator like India and sub-Saharan Africa.

'It's extremely frightening to think what would happen if 30 to 40 days a year were exceeding the extremely dangerous threshold,' Zeppetello said.

'These are frightening scenarios that we still have the capacity to prevent. This study shows you the abyss, but it also shows you that we have some agency to prevent these scenarios from happening.'

The authors suggest that without adaptation measures there may be large increases in heat-related illnesses – particularly in the elderly, outdoor workers and those with lower incomes.

'The health consequences of regular very high temperatures, particularly for the elderly, poor, and outdoor workers, would be profound and require a basic reorientation to the risks of extreme heat even in the midlatitudes,' they say.

79824ff3-eea7-41c4-b86f-96bc0ba26c23,"The world is heating up, and it's threatening habitability in many regions around the equator.

At this stage, even if we can limit global warming to 2 ˚C above pre-industrial levels, new estimates suggest the tropics and subtropics, including India, the Arabian peninsula and sub-Saharan Africa, will experience dangerously hot temperatures most days of the year by 2100.

The mid-latitudes of the world, meanwhile, will experience intense heat waves each year at least. In the United States city of Chicago, for instance, researchers predict a 16-fold increase in dangerous heat waves by the end of the century.

The chances of us avoiding that fate? About 0.1 percent, in terms of the projected probability of us limiting warming to below 1.5 ˚C above pre-industrial temperatures. In all probability, researchers say the world will have exceeded 2 ˚C of warming by 2050.

In this case, researchers say ""extremely dangerous heat stress will be a regular feature of the climate in sub-Saharan Africa, parts of the Arabian peninsula, and much of the Indian subcontinent"".

Unless the world can work together to implement rapid and widespread adaptation measures, there will likely be many deaths. But every bit we can reduce temperatures by still matters, because every fraction of a degree of less heat will save lives.

Recent estimates suggest global warming is already responsible for one in three heat-related deaths globally.

Based on these rates, other studies predict humans will die in record numbers in the coming decades as climate change tightens its grip on our planet.

How humans cope with heat stress, however, is complicated by other factors, like humidity. The current estimates are based on a metric known as the Heat Index, which only takes into account relative humidity up to certain temperatures.

This is the traditional measurement used by researchers to measure heat stress, and yet recent studies have found the human body might not be able to cope with as much heat and humidity as this index indicates.

As it stands, 93 °C (200 °F) on the Heat Index is considered the ceiling of what is survivable.

But at 100 percent humidity, new research suggests even young and healthy people may not live past 31 °C.

Nevertheless, on the traditional Heat Index, temperatures are considered dangerous when they exceed 40 °C (103°F) and extremely dangerous when they exceed 51 °C.

These are the thresholds the current study used to predict habitability in the future, and there's a good chance they are an underestimation of what is to come.

Even by this measure, however, humanity's prospects look dire.

Between 1979 to 1998, the dangerous Heat Index threshold was exceeded in the tropics and subtropics on 15 percent of the days each year.

During this time, it was rare for temperatures to become extremely dangerous as per the Heat Index.

Sadly, the same can't be said of today, and the problem is only getting worse.

By 2050, in tropical regions, the dangerous Heat Index could be exceeded on 50 percent of the days each year. By 2100, it could be exceeded on most days.

What's more, about 25 percent of those days could be so hot, they could exceed extremely dangerous thresholds.

""It is likely that, without major emissions reductions, large portions of the global tropics and subtropics would experience Heat Index levels higher than considered 'dangerous' for a majority of the year by the end of the century,"" the authors write.

""Without adaptation measures, this would greatly increase the incidence of heat-related illnesses and reduce outdoor working capacity in many regions where subsistence farming is important.""

The health and societal consequences would no doubt be profound.

The study was published in Communications Earth & Environment."
980ef99f-91cf-40ba-8ba0-0581bced892a,"What's considered officially “dangerous heat” in coming decades will likely hit much of the world at least three times more often as climate change worsens, according to a new study.

In much of Earth's wealthy mid-latitudes, spiking temperatures and humidity that feel like 103 degrees (39.4 degrees Celsius) or higher — now an occasional summer shock — statistically should happen 20 to 50 times a year by mid-century, said a study Monday in the journal Communications Earth & Environment.

By 2100, that brutal heat index may linger for most of the summer for places like the U.S. Southeast, the study's author said.

And it’s far worse for the sticky tropics. The study said a heat index considered “extremely dangerous” where the feels-like heat index exceeds 124 degrees (51 degrees Celsius) — now something that rarely happens — will likely strike a tropical belt that includes India one to four weeks a year by century's end.

“So that’s kind of the scary thing about this,” said study author Lucas Zeppetello, a Harvard climate scientist. “That’s something where potentially billions of people are going to be exposed to extremely dangerous levels of heat very regularly. So something that's gone from virtually never happening before will go to something that is happening every year.”

Zeppetello and colleagues used more than 1,000 computer simulations to look at the probabilities of two different levels of high heat — heat indexes of 103 degrees (39.4 Celsius) and above 124 degrees (51 Celsius), which are dangerous and extremely dangerous thresholds according to the U.S. National Weather Service. They calculated for the years 2050 and 2100 and compared that to how often that heat happened each year across the world from 1979 to 1998.

The study found a three- to ten-fold increase in 103-degree heat in the mid-latitudes even in the unlikely best-case scenario of global warming limited to only 3.6 degrees (2 degrees Celsius) since pre-industrial times — the less stringent of two international goals.

Story continues

There's only a 5% chance for warming to be that low and that infrequent, the study found. What's more likely, according to the study, is that the 103-degree heat will steam the tropics “during most days of each typical year” by 2100.

Chicago hit that 103 degree heat index level only four times from 1979 to 1998. But the study’s most likely scenario shows Chicago hitting that hot-and-sticky threshold 11 times a year by the end of the century.

Heat waves are one of the new four horsemen of apocalyptic climate change, along with sea level rise, water scarcity and changes in the overall ecosystem, said Zeppetello, who did much of the research at University of Washington state during the warming-charged 2021 heat wave that shattered records and killed thousands.

“Sadly, the horrific predictions shown in this study are credible,” climate scientist Jennifer Francis of the Woodwell Climate Research Center, who was not part of the study team, said in an email. “The past two summers have provided a window into our steamy future, with lethal heat waves in Europe, China, northwestern North America, India, the south-central U.S., the U.K., central Siberia, and even New England. Already hot places will become uninhabitable as heat indices exceed dangerous thresholds, affecting humans and ecosystems alike. Areas where extreme heat is now rare will also suffer increasingly, as infrastructure and living things are ill-adapted to the crushing heat.”

The study focuses on the heat index and that’s smart because it’s not just heat but the combination with humidity that hurts health, said Harvard School of Public Health professor Dr. Renee Salas, who is an emergency room physician.

“As the heat index rises, it becomes harder and harder to cool our bodies,” Salas, who wasn’t part of the research team, said in an email. “Heat stroke is a potentially deadly form of heat illness that occurs when body temperatures rise to dangerous levels.”

The study is based on mathematical probabilities instead of other climate research that looks at what happens at various carbon pollution levels. Because of that, University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann is more skeptical of this research. It also doesn’t take into account landmark U.S. climate legislation that President Joe Biden signed earlier this month or new efforts by Australia, he said.

“The obstacles at this point are political and no statistical methods, regardless of how powerful or sophisticated can predict whether we will garner the political will to overcome them,” Mann said in an email. “But there is reason for cautious optimism.”

The dangerous levels of heat that have scorched swathes of the northern hemisphere this summer are likely to hit most of the world between three and 10 times more often by the turn of the century, as the impacts of the human-caused climate crisis accelerate, a new study has found.

That increase is projected to happen in mid-latitude countries, like the US, China, Japan and those in Western Europe, according to the study, published in Communications Earth & Environment on Thursday by researchers at Harvard University and the University of Washington. “Dangerous heat” is defined as 39.4 degrees Celsius (103 degrees Fahrenheit) and above.

By 2050, the number of days of dangerous heat in this region will more than double.

Deadly heat waves are currently rare in the mid-latitudes, but they are likely to start happening annually in this region. Chicago, for example, is projected to see a 16-fold increase in dangerous heatwaves by 2100, the study shows.

The situation will be even worse in the tropics, where people could be exposed to dangerous heat most days of the year. Days of “extremely dangerous heat” — which is defined as 51C (124F) — could double. Experts say those levels of heat push the limits of human survivability.

The projections were made under the assumption that average global temperatures will rise by 2 degrees Celsius, a cap set out in the 2015 Paris Agreement. The agreement says that a lower goal of 1.5C of warming is preferable, and there is growing momentum for the world to keep to 1.5C by making deeper and quicker cuts to greenhouse gas emissions.

“The record-breaking heat events of recent summers will become much more common in places like North America and Europe,” said lead author Lucas Vargas Zeppetello from Harvard University in a press release. “For many places close to the equator, by 2100 more than half the year will be a challenge to work outside, even if we begin to curb emissions.”

The study used the heat index, which considers both air temperature and humidity to measure the impact on heat on humans.

“These standards were first created for people working indoors in places like boiler rooms — they were not thought of as conditions that would happen in outdoor, ambient environments. But we are seeing them now,” Vargas Zeppetello said.

The world’s nations agreed at international climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland, last year to come to this year’s talks in Egypt with emissions reductions plans that align with the Paris Agreement. Several countries have missed deadlines to submit their updated plans.

The authors of the study said the world must find ways to adapt to the changing levels of heat to avoid a spike in illnesses, especially among elderly people, those who work outdoor and those with lower incomes.

Several European countries are poorly set up to deal with extreme heat. In the UK, for example, few people have air conditioning, trains were canceled and an airport runway melted during a days-long heat wave, where temperatures surpassed 40C for the first time on record.

The study looked at predictions from existing global climate models, projections for human population increases, and the relationship between economic growth and carbon emissions to establish how much and how quickly temperatures were expected to rise.

They also estimated that there was only a 0.1% chance of limiting warming to 1.5C by 2100, and that the world will likely approach 2C of warming as soon as 2050. Many countries and businesses are aiming to achieve net zero – where greehouse gas emissions are no greater than those removed from the atmosphere – by that same year.

“These are frightening scenarios that we still have the capacity to prevent,” Vargas Zeppetello said. “This study shows you the abyss, but it also shows you that we have some agency to prevent these scenarios from happening.”"

Record-breaking heat waves have occurred recently from Delhi to the Pacific Northwest, and the number of these deadly events is expected to increase. New research from the University of Washington and Harvard University gives a range of heat impacts worldwide by the end of this century, depending on future emissions of greenhouse gases.

The study was published Aug. 25 in the open-access journal Communications Earth & Environment.

""The record-breaking heat events of recent summers will become much more common in places like North America and Europe,"" said lead author Lucas Vargas Zeppetello, who did the research as a doctoral student at the UW and is now a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard. ""For many places close to the equator, by 2100 more than half the year will be a challenge to work outside, even if we begin to curb emissions.""

""Our study shows a broad range of possible scenarios for 2100,"" he added. ""This shows that the emissions choices we make now still matter for creating a habitable future.""

The study looks at a combination of air temperature and humidity known as the ""heat index"" that measures impact on the human body. A ""dangerous"" heat index is defined by the National Weather Service as 103 F (39.4 C). An ""extremely dangerous"" heat index is 124 F (51 C), deemed unsafe to humans for any amount of time.

""These standards were first created for people working indoors in places like boiler rooms—they were not thought of as conditions that would happen in outdoor, ambient environments. But we are seeing them now,"" Vargas Zeppetello said.

The study finds that even if countries manage to meet the Paris Agreement goal of keeping warming to 2 C, crossing the ""dangerous"" threshold will be three to 10 times more common by 2100 in the U.S., Western Europe, China and Japan. In that same scenario, dangerous days could double by 2100 in the tropics, covering half the year.

In a worst-case scenario in which emissions remain unchecked until 2100, ""extremely dangerous"" conditions, in which humans should not be outdoors for any amount of time, could become common in countries closer to the equator—notably in India and sub-Saharan Africa.

""It's extremely frightening to think what would happen if 30 to 40 days a year were exceeding the extremely dangerous threshold,"" Vargas Zeppetello said. ""These are frightening scenarios that we still have the capacity to prevent. This study shows you the abyss, but it also shows you that we have some agency to prevent these scenarios from happening.""

The study uses a probability-based method to calculate the range of future conditions. Instead of using the four future emissions pathways included in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports, the authors use a statistical approach that combines historical data with population projections, economic growth and carbon intensity—the amount of carbon emitted for each dollar of economic activity—to predict the likely range of future CO 2 concentrations.

The statistical approach ""gives plausible ranges for carbon emissions and future temperature and has been estimated statistically from and validated against historical data,"" said co-author Adrian Raftery, a UW professor of statistics and of sociology with an adjunct appointment in atmospheric sciences.

The authors translated the higher carbon dioxide levels into a range of global temperature increases, then looked at how that would affect global monthly weather patterns.

""The number of days with dangerous levels of heat in the mid-latitudes—including the southeastern and central U.S.—will more than double by 2050,"" said co-author David Battisti, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the UW. ""Even for the very low-end estimates of carbon emissions and climate response, by 2100 much of the tropics will experience 'dangerous' levels of heat stress for nearly half the year.""

The results underline the need to both reduce future greenhouse gas emissions and to protect populations, especially outdoor workers, against dangerous heat."
5c363bf2-0cca-4831-b55f-b34ed85b0c5a,"In the months after Hurricane Harvey, scientists found that climate change most likely made the torrential rainfall that inundated Houston during and after the hurricane much worse, as warmer air holds more moisture that is then unleashed as precipitation. The rainfall total was 15 percent to 38 percent greater than it would have been in a world that was not warming, according to estimates from two studies published in 2017.

For the latest study, published in the journal Nature Communications, the researchers built on those estimates and created several models to reflect a variety of precipitation scenarios. They found that if not for the impact of climate change on rainfall, 30 percent to 50 percent of the flooded properties — or up to 50,000 homes — would have been spared flooding from Harvey.

Even in the most conservative scenario, in which only 7 percent of the precipitation is associated with climate change, the researchers still found that nearly 13 percent of the affected buildings would not have been flooded at all in a nonwarming world.

The study is the latest contribution to the field of climate science called climate attribution, which uses computational modeling and analyses to determine the relationship between specific extreme weather events and global warming.

The novelty of this study is that it goes one step further to look at social inequality through the lens of attribution science, said Antonia Sebastian, an assistant professor of environmental science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who was not involved with the study but helped peer review it."
e26a79de-9dd8-41d1-92cd-27125565e7a9,"The people we spoke to also referred to Hurricane Harvey as a “freak storm” and told us that a similarly intense deluge was unlikely to occur again for decades, if not a century. And they struggled to understand whether climate change was making them more vulnerable. Many didn’t think so, and even those who did were uncertain how to assess the threat to themselves. Without clear information about this kind of risk, it’s not surprising that residents didn’t have any plans to relocate.

What does this mean for managed retreat in a future where more and more places will face floods made more severe, and in some places more frequent, by climate change?

Currently, the money spent by the federal government on moving away from vulnerable places pales in comparison to that spent on rebuilding damaged properties. Programs like the Small Business Administration’s disaster loan assistance for homeowners instead encourage people to stay by providing money to repair their houses.

More resources for managed retreat could certainly help motivate relocation. But policymakers must also consider the emotional attachments people have to particular places. Encouraging mobility will require better information on the risks of staying put and the resources residents would have access to in less flood-prone neighborhoods. It will also require more equitable investments in those resources — like schools and other social services — before disasters strike, so that people feel they won’t be giving anything up by moving.

In the short term, far more needs to be done to communicate risk. While some residents may never want to leave their homes, our interviews in Friendswood show that few people have clear information about their vulnerability to future flooding. The federal government should mandate that flood risk is made clear in every lease, deed and mortgage contract and that this information is updated annually. Residents also need to know about alternative places to live before, and immediately after, their homes are damaged — the period when people are most open to accepting buyouts.

Efforts to expand managed retreat won’t be easy. But any costs for supporting managed retreat will ultimately be made up in savings from not having to repair homes that are just going to flood again and again."

On Monday morning, the Dallas-Fort Worth area awoke to disaster. Rain was pouring down at the rate of 2 to 3 inches per hour. Highways became lethal lagoons, brooks became basins, and thousands of people scrambled to higher ground. 10 steps you can take to lower your carbon footprint ArrowRight Just a day earlier, the city had been facing one of its worst droughts on record, with farmers forced to thin their herds as reservoirs rapidly shrank. Twenty-nine percent of the Lone Star State was encapsulated within a top-tier level 4 out of 4 “exceptional” drought. Very dry conditions took a heavy toll on crops and forced widespread water restrictions.

The extreme case of atmospheric caprice highlighted a growing issue plaguing communities across the United States and the world: weather whiplash.

This summer, several locations around the United States have experienced these wild, rapid swings from one weather extreme to another. About half of the country has undergone at least a moderate drought this summer. Parts of the West, the Midwest and Texas have experienced exceptional and historic drought conditions.

Then the storms came. On July 26 in St. Louis, a shocking 8.65 inches of rain fell to mark the city’s wettest day on record. The next day, in eastern Kentucky, rainfall rates topped 2 inches per hour and took the lives of 38 people. In August, eastern Illinois, Death Valley and Dallas also experienced significant or record-breaking rainfall. On Wednesday, flash flooding across central Mississippi swept away roads and prompted rescues.

“It is unusual, especially on the extreme precipitation [and] flash flood side,” said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California at Los Angeles. “They’re not just beating a historical record by a marginal amount, but just completely blowing right past it and then some.”

Yet he isn’t surprised: A warmer climate is driving precipitation to higher extremes in both flooding and drought.

“The increase in both extreme precipitation events and in these wild swings between extreme precipitation and extreme aridity — this is how most people and most ecosystems on Earth are experiencing climate change,” Swain said.

Two sides of the same coin

How can both drought and high-rain events result from climate change? Simple.

Warmer air can hold more water. In fact, for every degree Fahrenheit the atmosphere warms, the air can hold about 4 percent more water. Where there is moisture available, such as along the Gulf or East coasts, more moisture can be transported and dropped, leading to flooding and high-end precipitation totals.

But where moisture is scarce, such as in the West, warmer air sucks humidity out of the ground. This desiccated landscape reinforces extreme heat, leading to drought and extreme wildfire behavior.

The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change highlighted this issue in a recent assessment report, writing that “aridification” and “extreme precipitation events that lead to severe flooding” are both byproducts of the warming climate.

“Whiplash events have always happened, but now we’re seeing the flips from one weather regime to another become more violent and disruptive...yet another clear signal that the climate crisis is with us now,” said Jennifer Francis, a senior scientist at Woodwell Climate Research Center, in an email.

There has also been a tendency for weather patterns to become “stuck,” stalling for longer. That may be why Dallas faced drought for months and was 11 inches behind for the year before this week’s flooding. Now, such precipitation extremes are more feast or famine.

It may have to do with a wavier jet stream, which is believed to be shifting weather features west to east (in the Northern Hemisphere) more slowly. That allows for systems to stall. If a heat dome becomes entrenched in place, weeks of sunshine and dry weather can prevail. In all instances of thousand-year rain events in the West, Midwest and Texas this summer, a stalled frontal boundary was responsible for the deluges.

Make no mistake — when it comes to weather, getting a perfectly average day is atypical. Averages are just found by smoothing over the dips and crests in a random chaotic system. But when heat energy and entropy, or a bit of extra chaos, is added to that system, the dips and crests become much more extreme.

Although events have become more extreme, Francis said recent studies suggest that whiplash events haven’t become more common yet, but she added computer models “paint a clear picture of more frequent events if we continue to warm the globe by burning fossil fuels and destroying large tracts of forest.”

Flash flooding won’t cure a drought

Record flooding should fix a record drought, right? Not quite.

Water during a drought can help, but how fast and how much water falls matters.

During a drought, the ground dries and becomes less permeable. Top soils harden, which make it easier for water to run off. Drought also kills plants and leaves the ground bare, which further limits how much water the soil can absorb. When it rains, much of the water immediately runs off and doesn’t replenish the soils, aquifers or river flow beyond the initial burst.

“You get more instantaneous runoff, higher flashy flood flows on rivers and streams, but less of that water is soaking into the ground,” Swain said. “So you’re getting less soil moisture from the same amount of water.”

In fact, drought can actually lead to a greater risk of flooding. The dry ground hit with the rapid rainfall can promote runoff and trigger widespread flooding.

For instance, in Dallas, while the rainfall was desperately needed, most of what fell didn’t benefit the greater metro area. The event caused deadly flash flooding, but also almost all of the water that came down washed into a watershed that flows into Lake Livingston and eventually toward Houston. The National Weather Service in Fort Worth summed it up by writing “heavy rain, but wrong watershed.”

And last week, about 200 people were trapped for several hours in New Mexico’s Carlsbad Caverns National Park amid heavy flooding.

Swain said weather whiplash also means there are more dry days between the few rainy days — providing more opportunities for the water to evaporate back into the atmosphere. Even the water that does stick around may evaporate quickly, especially in a warming world.

“The soil moisture and the vegetation is still going to be responding in the long run as if there’s a severe drought, because in the long run, there still is,” Swain said.

Torrential downpours in Texas. Historic heat in China. Rising hunger in Africa. Europe’s worst drought in 500 years. Glacial melting in Antarctica.

INTO THE RED: Climate and the fight of our lives

Here’s a look at some of the climate disasters unfolding around the world right now.

On Sunday, a deluge hit Dallas, taking the life of a 60-year-old woman, leaving cars floating in the streets, and prompting dozens of high-water rescues. Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport reported 9.19 inches of rain in 24 hours from Sunday to Monday afternoon — the most rain the city has seen in a single day since 1932.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a disaster declaration on Tuesday, freeing up state resources for those impacted by the storm and creating the possibility for further federal aid. At least 100 homes have been damaged by the flooding, he said, and that number is expected to climb.

Meanwhile, unprecedented extreme temperatures have beat down on a swath of central, eastern, and southwestern China for the past 73 days. It’s the longest and most widespread heat wave the world has ever seen.

The record-shattering heat has set forests aflame, shriveled crops, and prompted factory closures. And it’s left the iconic Yangtze River dry, unleashing an array of cascading effects.

Historically low water levels have led to a shortage of hydropower, forcing some cities in the southwest part of the country to dim subway lights and billboards to conserve power. Receding waters also have revealed relics long hidden beneath the river, including three 600-year-old Buddhist statues and an ancient bridge.

The heat wave is “almost certainly attributable” to climate change, said Andrew Pershing, director of climate science at Climate Central, a nonprofit that tracks climate data. Earlier this summer, his organization released the Climate Shift Index, which calculates how much more likely daytime high and overnight low temperatures are to occur because of climate change. Preliminary data on China shows a strong link.

While some of China suffers due to the lack of water, another region of the country has faced the opposite problem.

In the northwest province of Qinghai, heavy rains last week spurred floods and mudslides that killed at least 16 and left three dozen missing, according to state media.

Some rivers ran so high that they changed course, making the floods even worse. Thousands have been forced to evacuate.

The floods haven’t yet been scientifically attributed to climate change.

“Flooding is harder to attribute in a formal sense, mostly because rainfall statistics are so messy,” said Pershing. “However, we expect that a warmer atmosphere will hold more water vapor, making big rain events more likely.”

Meanwhile, Europe is experiencing its worst drought in at least 500 years, according to a preliminary analysis.

There too, wildfires are sparking, hydropower generation is low, and crop yields are under threat.

As in China, the drought has revealed relics that have long been hidden beneath rivers. Along the Danube — which has fallen to one of its lowest levels in 100 years — around two dozen explosive-covered German warships that sunk during World War II were left exposed.

The drought is fueled by this summer’s heat. In July, the European Union saw a heat wave that was made 10 times more likely by climate change, according to the World Weather Attribution.

“Once you warm up the air, it sucks more water out of the ground and out of the plants, and so the chances of also having drought happening increase as well,” said Jennifer Francis, a senior scientist at the Massachusetts-based Woodwell Climate Research Center.

Another troubling effect of that heat: Glaciers in the Alps are experiencing the most severe levels of melting ever recorded. Some glaciers have melted a stunning one to two months earlier than in a normal year.

The Horn of Africa, one of the most drought-prone regions in the world, has seen four consecutive years of dry conditions, making it nearly impossible to grow food or raise livestock.

Up to 22 million people in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia are facing severe hunger, and more than 7 million people have left their homes in search of food and water, according to the World Food Program.

The drought is having especially devastating effects on children, according to the United Nations. Fifteen million children in the Horn of Africa have left school due to the drought, and more than 3 million more are at risk of dropping out.

Heavy rains also have triggered devastating flash floods across much of Pakistan this summer. This week alone, they’ve killed 126 people, the country’s National Disaster Management Authority said Wednesday.

Since mid-June, 903 people have been killed in flash floods in the nation, and about 50,000 people have been left homeless.

Tens of thousands of houses have been swept away by flood waters, forcing many to live in tents miles away from their home villages and towns, the Associated Press reported.

Schools have closed. Bridges and businesses have been destroyed. And as a result of all the damage, the nation’s economic crisis has gotten even worse.

Closer to home, the Colorado River Basin, which provides water to Colorado and six other states, is in year 23 of a historic drought. The conditions are “clearly connected to climate change,” said Francis.

For the second year in a row, the federal government said this month that Arizona, Nevada, and Mexico will have to cut their water usage dramatically.

Heat, again, exacerbates drought. Elsewhere in the US, the Climate Shift Index shows that much of the Pacific Northwest is experiencing temperatures that are at least twice as likely due to climate change, said Pershing.

Here in New England, drought conditions also are persisting. Lawns and farms have been scorched, rivers are running dry, and in Massachusetts, 800 brush fires have been reported this year, including 35 in the past week across 188 acres of land.

“That’s a lot for us in the middle of August,” David Celino, chief fire warden for the state’s Department of Conservation and Recreation, told the Globe this week.

Each of these events was the result of complex weather patterns. Are they also connected to climate change?

“100 percent,” said Francis.

This is what the planet looks like after 1.1 degrees of warming on average. Without urgent action to kick fossil fuels and curb greenhouse gas pollution, the impacts will get even worse.

49fdad10-606f-4359-a80f-fed56d6d8733,"Parts of northern Texas, mired in a drought labeled as extreme and exceptional, are flooding under torrential rain. In a drought.

Sound familiar? It should. The Dallas region is just the latest drought-suffering-but-flooded locale during a summer of extreme weather whiplash, likely goosed by human-caused climate change, scientists say. Parts of the world are lurching from drought to deluge.

The St. Louis area and 88% of Kentucky early in July were considered abnormally dry and then the skies opened up, the rain poured in biblical proportions, inch after inch, and deadly flooding devastated communities. The same thing happened in Yellowstone in June. Earlier this month, Death Valley, in a severe drought, got a near record amount of rainfall in one day, causing floods, and is still in a nasty drought.

China’s Yangtze River is drying up, a year after deadly flooding. China is baking under what is a record-long heat wave, already into its third month, with a preliminary report of an overnight low temperature only dipping down to 94.8 degrees (34.9 degrees Celsius) in the heavily populated city of Chongqing. And in western China flooding from a sudden downpour has killed more than a dozen people.

In the Horn of Africa in the midst of a devastating but oft-ignored famine and drought, nearby flash floods add to the humanitarian disaster unfolding. Europe, which suffered through unprecedented flooding last year, has baked with record heat compounded by a 500-year drought that is drying up rivers and threatening power supplies.

“So we really have had a lot of whiplash,” said Kentucky’s interim climatologist Megan Schargorodski. “It is really difficult to emotionally go through all of these extremes and get through it and figure out how to be resilient through the disaster after disaster that we see.”

In just two weeks in late July and early August, the U.S. had 10 downpours that are only supposed to happen 1% of the time — sometimes called 1-in-100-year storms — calculated Weather Prediction Center forecast branch chief Greg Carbin. That’s not counting the Dallas region, a likely 1-in-1,000-year storm, where some places got more than 9 inches of rain in 24 hours ending Monday with several inches more forecast to come.

Story continues

“These extremes of course are getting more extreme,” said National Center for Atmospheric Research climate scientist Gerald Meehl, who wrote some of the first studies 18 years ago about extreme weather and climate change. “This is in line with what we expected.”

Weather whiplash, “where all of a sudden it changes to the opposite’’ extreme, is becoming more noticeable because it’s so strange, said climate scientist Jennifer Francis of the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Falmouth, Massachusetts. She is in the middle of a study of whiplash events.

The scientists at World Weather Attribution, mostly volunteers who quickly examine extreme weather for a climate change fingerprint, have a strict criteria of events to investigate: they have to be record-breaking, cause a significant number of deaths, or impact at least 1 million people. So far this year they’ve been swamped. There have been 41 events — eight floods, three storms, eight droughts, 18 heat waves and four cold waves — that have reached that threshold point, said WWA official Julie Arrighi, associate director of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Center.

In the United States, many of the big heavy summer rains are traditionally connected to hurricanes or tropical systems, like last year’s Hurricane Ida that smacked Louisiana and then plowed through the South until it flooded the New York, New Jersey region with record rainfall rates.

But this July and August, the nation had been hit with “an overabundance of non-tropical related extreme rainfall,” the National Weather Service’s Carbin said. “That’s unusual.”

Scientists suspect climate change is at work in two different ways.

The biggest way is simple physics. As the atmosphere warms it holds more water, 4% more for every degree (7% more for every degree Celsius), scientists said.

Think of the air as a giant sponge, said UCLA and Nature Conservancy climate scientist Daniel Swain. It soaks up more water from parched ground like a sponge “which is why we’re seeing worse droughts in some places,” he said. Then when a weather system travels further, juicy with that extra water, it has more to dump, causing downpours.

Another factor is the stuck and wavier jet stream — the atmospheric river that moves weather systems around the world — said Woodwell’s Francis. Storm systems don’t move and just dump huge amounts of water in some places. Other places, like China, are stuck with hot weather as cooler, wetter weather moves around them.

“When that jet stream pattern gets amplified, which is what we’re starting to see happen more often, then we notice more of these big whiplash events,” Francis said.

When the ground is so hard from drought, water doesn't seep in as much and runs off faster in flood, Francis and others said.

This will only get worse as climate change worsens, so “it highlights the type of events that we need to adapt to, that we need to harden ourselves against,” said Princeton University climate scientist Gabriel Vecchi.

The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emphasized what it called compounding weather disasters as a future threat.

“Frankly how fast and how badly it’s now playing out is a surprise to many of us,” said IPCC report co-author Maarten van Aalst, director of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre in the Netherlands. “It’s scary how quickly it is appearing in front of our eyes.”

51bb017d-50fc-4526-a570-3d5c87bb9ee9,"A private jet that belongs to Steven Spielberg has burned through more than $116,000 worth of jet fuel since June despite the Hollywood director claiming that he's 'terrified of climate change.'

The Gulfstream G650 jet has clocked 16 trips spanning 17,000 miles since June 23, according to flight tracking data from ADS-B Exchange that was compiled by Celebrity Jets and reported by Fox News this week.

Spielberg has previously spoken out about his fear of global warming, calling for 'everyone' to be mindful that it could 'pose a danger to your children and grandchildren.'

'I'm terrified of [global warming],' Spielberg said in a 2018 interview for his film 'Ready Player One.' 'Global warming is a scientific reality. It's not a political trick. It's a true piece of real, measurable, quantifiable science.

Spielberg is not the only celebrity who has spoken out against global warming while continuing to jet off across the world.

Kylie Jenner, Taylor Swift and Mark Wahlberg have all faced backlash in recent months for their frequent short flights on multi-million dollar jets.

Celeb Jets chronicled the journeys of celebrities over the last few months, with many trips lasting less than 30 minutes from lift off to landing.

It comes after the social media page outed Kylie Jenner for a 12-minute flight across California, which saw her branded a 'climate criminal' by furious eco-warriors.

Speaking about his movie Ready Player One in 2018, Spielberg said: 'I'm terrified of global warming. Global warming is a scientific reality it's not a political trick, it's a true piece of real measurable quantifiable since.

'And people have to come around to believing that were are going to have a confrontation with destiny unless we do something about it today.

'I think we have to blame everybody that is just, when you are not mindful of something that could pose a danger to your children and grandchildren.

'Then you just go blithely through life with aerosol cans and doing all sorts of things that are depleting the ozone.'

But this hasn't stopped the director from taking his $70million Gulfstream G650 jet on frequent trips - some only lasting 17 minutes, like the flight he took on June 29 - a 28-mile trip from Amsterdam Airport to Rotterdam Airport that would have taken him just 36 minutes by car, or an hour by public transport.

Since June, Spielberg's jet traveled 3,589 miles from Westhampton, New York, to Amsterdam, Netherlands, on June 29, burning $21,183 worth of fuel and emitting 32 tons of carbon dioxide, according Celebrity Jets.

The jet then traveled to Rotterdam, Netherlands, and returned to Westhampton on July 1, burning another $24,685 worth of fuel and emitting an additional 38 tons of carbon.

On July 11, his jet traveled from Westhampton to Van Nuys, California, and on July 21 from Westhampton to Knock, Ireland, and on August 4, it traveled from Teterboro, New Jersey, to Van Nuys.

Spielberg's most recent trip recorded was a flight from Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, to Teterboro on Thursday night.

At the end of July, singer Taylor Swift was named the 'biggest celebrity CO2 polluter of the year' by a study that found her private jet has taken a whopping 170 flights since January.

The study released by British digital marketing firm Yard is based on an analysis of private plane flights tracked by the automated flight tracker Celebrity Jets, and found that Swift's jet logged the most emissions of the pack.

The report came as a redemption for Kylie Jenner, who was branded a 'climate criminal' earlier this month for posting a picture of her and Travis Scott's matching his-and-hers private jets earlier this month.

But despite the backlash over that incident, and another in which she took a 12-minute flight instead of making a 26-mile drive, Jenner did not even make Yard's top-10 list of celebrity polluters, ranking at a lowly 19.

Swift, through a representative, batted back furiously at the report after facing online backlash from fans, saying that she often let other people take her Falcon 7X jet on jaunts around the world.

'Taylor's jet is loaned out regularly to other individuals,' Swift's rep told Rolling Stone. 'To attribute most or all of these trips to her is blatantly incorrect.'

In the pollution rankings, Swift's jet narrowly beat out Floyd Mayweather's for the top spot. Other notables in the top 10 include Jay Z, country singer Blake Shelton, director Steven Spielberg, Kim Kardashian, Mark Wahlberg, and Oprah Winfrey.

Although Swift has remained silent on political and social issues for much of her career, she has spoken out more in recent years, and named climate change as one of the issues that concerned her in a 2020 interview with Variety.

The study came in response to an Instagram post that Scott's longtime on-again, off-again partner Kylie Jenner posted to Instagram on July 15.

The internet reacted with fury after Jenner posted a photo showing what appeared to be her and Scott's matching private jets, commenting: 'you wanna take mine or yours?'

Reports also emerged that she had taken a 12-minute flight on her private jet for journey that would have taken just 40 minutes by car, leading some critics to dub her a 'climate criminal'.

Her jet travelled for 35 minutes from Palm Springs, just outside of LA, to Van Nuys, in Los Angeles, close to her $36million Hidden Hills mansion on July 15.

Two hours later the mum-of-two then flew from Van Nuys, to Camarillo in in Ventura County, California - a trip which took just 12 minutes according to CelebrityJets on Twitter.

The account also revealed that the Bombardier Global 7500 plane travelled from Camarillo, California, to Van Nuys two days before on July 13 – a trip of just 17 minutes.

Her jet then took a 29-minute flight later the same day, travelling from Van Nuys to Palm Springs, California.

The eco-hypocrite jet set: Stars such as Mark Wahlberg, Jay Z and Steven Spielberg lecture us about saving the planet... then use their private jets for flights that take just MINUTES instead of driving

By Emma James For Dailymail.Com

They love to lecture about saving the planet with social media posts about going vegan, cutting CO2 emissions or ditching gas-guzzling vehicles.

But these celebrities then go and use their multi-million-dollar private jets to make journeys that take just minutes - and would often be quicker by car.

One website has exposed the eco-hypocrites for their not-so green credentials, with stars including Mark Wahlberg, Jay Z and Steven Spielberg among those outed.

Twitter handle @celebjets chronicled their journeys over the last few months, with many trips lasting less than 30 minutes from lift off to landing.

Wahlberg's plane took flight for just nine minutes as it jetted across LA, while Spielberg's clocked in at a staggering 17 minutes.

It comes after the social media page outed Kylie Jenner for a 12-minute flight across California, which saw her branded a 'climate criminal' by furious eco-warriors.

Meanwhile her sister Kourtney faced a huge backlash by fans for posting about carbon emissions in February, despite the family's excessive private air travel.

Aviation experts have said that the focus of private jets should be on 'responsible travel', by using 'carbon offset schemes.

Short haul flights of at least ten minutes can cause 1 ton of Co2 emissions to be created during the journey as well as gallons of fuel being burned off.

Here, DailyMail.com looks at some of the celebrities who have been exposed for their staggeringly short private jet flights:

Steven Spielberg - Jetted 17 minutes after saying 'I'm terrified of global warming'

Steven Spielberg's private jet is pictured at Luton Airport in England. He regularly uses it to travel short distances, despite sharing his fears over global warming

Steven Spielberg has previously said he is 'terrified' of global warming, calling for 'everyone' to be mindful that it could 'pose a danger to your children and grandchildren.

But the director and film producer didn't let that stop him from taking his $70million Gulfstream G650 jet, on a 17-minute flight on June 29.

His 28-mile trip from Amsterdam Airport to Rotterdam Airport would have taken him just 36 minutes by car, or an hour by public transport.

According to CelebrityJets, the flight used 145 gallons of jet fuel, cost him $1,011 for the fuel and resulted in 2 tons of Co2 emissions.

Speaking about his new movie Ready Player One in 2018, Spielberg said: 'I'm terrified of global warming. Global warming is a scientific reality it's not a political trick, it's a true piece of real measurable quantifiable since.

'And people have to come around to believing that were are going to have a confrontation with destiny unless we do something about it today.

'I think we have to blame everybody that is just, when you are not mindful of something that could pose a danger to your children and grandchildren.

'Then you just go blithely through life with aerosol cans and doing all sorts of things that are depleting the ozone.'

Jay Z and Beyoncé - 47-minute trip goes against their 'Greenprint Project'

Jay Z had a privte jet gifted to him by Puma, who even personalized the luxury Gulfstream IV with a tail number just for him

Power couple Beyoncé and Jay-Z have been encouraging the masses to switch to a plant-based diet with their Greenprint Project.

They want to share the 'positive impact we can have on the world by eating plant-based meals' according to the website.

The international stars own a $40million Bombardier Challenger 850, which can hold up to 19 passengers and has a kitchen, bedroom, two bathrooms, and a living room

But rapper Jay-Z also has access to a luxury Gulfstream IV, created and personalised for him by Puma – even created a tail number for him.

The Puma jet flew from Seattle International Airport to Eugene Airport in just 47minutes on July 17.

A commercial flight would set you back $178, and take an hour and five minutes to get to the destination.

Driving by car would take just under five hours, with the commercial flight taking one mile less and results in 0.07 tons of Co2 emissions being used.

The flight used up 353 gallons of jet fuel, costing $2,411 and ultimately creating 4 tons of Co2 emissions.

Speaking about the Greenprint Project, Beyonce said: 'The information is hard to ignore, the benefits of a single plant-based meal a day can have such a profound impact on our health and the environment, spanning from cutting carbon emissions to conserving water.

'We want to challenge you as we challenge ourselves to move towards a more plant-based lifestyle and acknowledge you for standing up for your health and the health of the planet.'

Drake - 18 minutes across Canada after launching partnership to 'reduce carbon footprint'

Drake had a Boeing 727 personalized for himself, with 'Air Drake' emblazoned on the engine of the multimillion dollar jet

Rapper Drake flew on his private plane for just 18 minutes from John Munro Hamilton International airport to Toronto Pearson International airport in Canada.

The 35-year-old could have driven between the two in 45 minutes, or 47 miles, but instead used 519 gallons of fuel on July 12.

According to CelebrityJets his Boeing 767, it would have cost him $3,590 for the short haul trip – adding up to 5 tons of Co2.

His plane, dubbed 'Air Drake' has gold detailing on the walls, a theatre room, three private suites, velvet couches and can hold a maximum of 30 passengers.

The star announced that he was partnering with Aspiration last year, after the start up also partnered with Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert Downey Jr.

Speaking about the project he said: 'It's exciting to partner with a company that's found an easy way to offer everyone the ability to reduce their carbon footprint.

'Aspiration's innovative approach to combating climate change is really inspiring and I hope together we can help to motivate and create awareness.'

Mark Wahlberg - Nine-minute flight across California

Wahlberg, who starred in M Night Shyamalan's climate change thrilled The Happening, jetted from LAX airport in LA, to Van Nuys Airport

Hollywood superstar Mark Wahlberg completely switched up his died in 2020 to a completely plant-based diet after years of eating huge amounts of animal products.

The Father Stu actor, 50, said that he felt 'really good' for the change, and advocated the removal of meat from his diet for the improvement.

Wahlberg, who starred in M Night Shyamalan's climate change thrilled The Happening, jetted from LAX airport in LA, to Van Nuys Airport at around 10pm on July 1.

He flew just nine minutes in his Bombardier BD-700 plane on the 19-mile trip, which would have taken around 40 minutes in a car with no traffic.

Alternatively, he could have taken a bus, which could have taken just over an hour, to get to his destination.

His flight used up 83 gallons of jet fuel, which cost $579 and created one ton of Co2 emissions.

Speaking to Boston.com in 2016 he said that he was 'very aware of the real world', after claiming that celebrities were 'in a bubble'.

Kim Kardashian - 10-minute trip on her $150million private jet

Kim was also slammed by fans for incessantly bragging about her own $150million private jet with cashmere from floor to ceiling and two luxury bathroom

More than a week before her sister Kylie Jenner faced a huge backlash for taking a 12 minute flight across California, Kim Kardashian flew the same route but two minutes quicker.

Kim, star of the Hulu show The Kardashians, flew from Van Nuys airport in Los Angeles to Camarillo Airport in ten minutes on July 7.

The 41-year-old jetted off on her $150million Gulfstream G650, fully personalised with cream carpets, on the 35-mile trip.

Experts revealed her trip would have cost $7200 for an hour if the private jet had been hired rather than owned by the star.

The trip would have taken her just 50 minutes to complete from one airport to the other with no traffic.

Using her private jet meant that 91 gallons of fuel were used, costing her $636 in fuel and creating 1 ton of Co2 emissions.

Previously the star has said that she wants to be more eco-friendly and has been making her various businesses environmentally friendly.

Kylie Jenner - 12-minute trip on 'Air Kylie' despite eco-conscious products

Kylie Jenner has been called a 'climate criminal' for reportedly taking a 12-minute flight on a private jet after coming under fire for boasting about her and Travis Scott's planes

Kylie Jenner has been slammed for taking a 12-minute flight on her private jet – for a 26-mile journey that would have taken just 39 minutes by car.

The 24-year-old billionaire was blasted as a 'climate criminal' for her short haul journey across California last week despite her lectures on protecting the environment.

She took her $70million 'Kylie Air' private plane twice across the county on July 13, and again just two days later on July 15.

The Bombardier Global 7500 jet travelled for 35 minutes from Palm Springs, just outside LA, to Van Nuys, near her $36million Hidden Hills mansion on July 15.

Two hours later the mum-of-two then flew from Van Nuys, to Camarillo in in Ventura County, California - a trip which took just 12 minutes .

Earlier, on July 13, Kylie had also flown from Camarillo to Van Nuys a trip of just 17 minutes. She had then taken a 29-minute flight, going from from Van Nuys to Palm Springs.

Experts revealed her trip would have cost around $1600 to just fuel the plane, but if the private jet had been hired it would have set her back about $7200.

Had the star driven the 26-mile trip from her home in Hidden Hills, to Camarillo it would have taken her just 39 minutes without the horrendous traffic that is usual in those areas.

But instead she drove 30 minutes in the wrong direction to Van Nuys airport, before jumping on the plane - with the journey taking longer despite the 12-minute flight.

She has consistently plugged the eco-friendly products she buys for her daughter Stormi, four, as well as telling her 359million social media she was going 'vegan and clean' with her products because it was 'time to elevate.'

The jet-setting hypocrisy of the super-rich climate preachers!

Katy Perry: Flew Kim's false nails 2,451 miles

When Orlando Bloom accepted an award for environmental campaigning in 2018, he urged: 'The urgency of climate change has never rung louder... The world is changing and we need to change our habits along with it.'

However, it later emerged the Hollywood actor, 45, had flown to the event in Monaco with his fiancée, pop singer Katy Perry, on a private jet.

In 2015, Perry, 37, told fans: 'Share your story on how you are helping to reduce climate change with the hashtag #FightUnfair.'

Three years later she reportedly flew false nails for Kim Kardashian by private jet 2,451 miles from LA to New York after the reality star forgot to pack them.

Perry was seen leaving a private jet in France in July 2021.

Brooklyn: I cut back on water for tea

The whole Beckham family has advocated action on climate change.

David and Victoria's eldest son Brooklyn told GQ Magazine in April last year: 'I do the basics, like not letting the water run when I brush my teeth, measure out my water for tea and I do not let the water run when I shower. Easy things like that make a difference.'

Yet the 23-year-old and his wife, heiress Nicola Peltz, 27, travelled by private jet on their first Christmas together in 2019.

He also flew with his family by private jet to Miami in December 2020.

Victoria and David flew by private plane to Brooklyn and Nicola's Palm Beach wedding in Florida in April.

Harry: Fans urged to sign up to concert 'eco villages'

Harry Styles may have launched a climate change campaign with his former One Direction bandmates – but that hasn't stopped him zipping around the globe on private jets to venues where he is performing.

In July 2015, One Direction worked with Save The Children to urge young fans to play their part in protecting the Earth and 'put pressure on our leaders'.

The Watermelon Sugar singer also set up 'eco village' stands at gigs on his Love On Tour, which encouraged fans to 'take action for the climate'.

Yet last October, Styles, 28, was seen landing in Orlando, Florida, on a private jet.

He was also in attendance at the 'Camp Google' climate summit in 2019, where VIPs including Prince Harry arrived on 114 different private jets.

A source close to Styles said he uses commercial flights as well.

Sussexes: Barefoot speeches for Google

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have spoken out to urge more action to protect the planet.

In June 2019, the couple told their nearly 10 million Instagram followers: 'With nearly 7.7 billion people inhabiting this Earth, every choice, every footprint, every action makes a difference.'

A month later, Prince Harry, 37, travelled to the island of Sicily via private jet to make a barefoot speech at a Google summit on climate change.

In May last year, he said: 'We need to do better about stopping or allowing the things that are causing so much harm.'

Yet in June, the couple hopped on a Bombardier Global 6000 – one of the most polluting types of private jet – back to California after a three-day stay in the UK for the Platinum Jubilee. In the past year, they've taken at least six private jet flights.

Djokovic: Educate children to recycle

Novak Djokovic has spoken candidly about how much he cares for the natural world.

Last August, the Serbian tennis legend, right, said: 'Environmental issues are essential. Not just for me, I think it should be essential for anybody else. This is the only planet we've got and so we might as well try to take care of it.'

A blog on his Novak Djokovic Foundation's website in 2019 urged parents to be 'eco role models' for their children by getting them to recycle and not waste water.

Yet Djokovic, 35, flies around the world on a private jet supplied by rival Roger Federer's firm NetJets, which hires its fleet to VIPs.

The company has sponsored Djokovic since 2015 and he 'owns' part of a plane under a fractional ownership arrangement."
f8d54b4f-9098-4354-bfa1-b9ca6dd6b173,"Just over 250 million years ago during the end of the Permian period and start of the Triassic, reptiles had one heck of a coming out party.

Their rates of evolution and diversity started exploding, leading to a dizzying variety of abilities, body plans, and traits, and helping to firmly establish both their extinct lineages and those that still exist today as one of the most successful and diverse animal groups the world has ever seen. For the longest time, this flourish was explained by their competition being wiped out by two of the biggest mass extinction events (around 261 and 252 million years ago) in the history of the planet.

A new Harvard-led study has rewritten that explanation by reconstructing how the bodies of ancient reptiles changed and by comparing it against millions of years of climate change.

Harvard paleontologist Stephanie Pierce’s lab shows that the morphological evolution and diversification seen in early reptiles not only started years before these mass extinction events but instead were directly driven by what caused them in the first place — rising global temperatures due to climate change.

“We are suggesting that we have two major factors at play — not just this open ecological opportunity that has always been thought by several scientists — but also something that nobody had previously come up with, which is that climate change actually directly triggered the adaptive response of reptiles to help build this vast array of new body plans and the explosion of groups that we see in the Triassic,” said Tiago R. Simões, a postdoctoral fellow in the Pierce lab and lead author on the study.

“Basically, [rising global temperatures] triggered all these different morphological experiments — some that worked quite well and survived for millions of years up to this day, and some others that basically vanished a few million years later,” Simões added.

In the paper, which published Friday in Science Advances, the researchers lay out the vast anatomical changes that took place in many reptile groups, including the forerunners of crocodiles and dinosaurs, in direct response to major climate shifts concentrated between 260 to 230 million years ago.

The study provides a close look at how a large group of organisms evolve because of climate change, which is especially pertinent today as temperatures continually rise. In fact, the rate of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere today is about nine times what they were during the timeframe that culminated in the biggest climate change-driven mass extinction of all time 252 million years ago: the Permian-Triassic mass extinction.

“Major shifts in global temperature can have dramatic and varying impacts on biodiversity,” said Stephanie E. Pierce, Thomas D. Cabot Associate Professor of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology and curator of vertebrate paleontology in the Museum of Comparative Zoology. “Here we show that rising temperatures during the Permian-Triassic led to the extinction of many animals, including many of the ancestors of mammals, but also sparked the explosive evolution of others, especially the reptiles that went on to dominate the Triassic period.”

The study involved close to eight years of data collection and took a heavy dose of camerawork, CT scanning, and loads of passport stamps as Simões traveled to more than 20 countries and more than 50 different museums to take scans and snapshots of more than 1,000 reptilian fossils.

With all the information, the researchers created an expansive dataset that was analyzed with state-of-the-art statistical methods to produce a diagram called an evolutionary time tree. Time trees reveal how early reptiles were related to each other, when their lineages first originated, and how fast they were evolving. They then combined it with global temperature data from millions of years ago.

Diversification of reptile body plans started about 30 million years before the Permian-Triassic extinction, making it clear these changes weren’t triggered by the event as previously thought. The extinction events did help put them in gear though.

The dataset also showed that rises in global temperatures, which started at about 270 million years ago and lasted until at least 240 million years ago, were followed by rapid body changes in most reptile lineages. For instance, some of the larger cold-blooded animals evolved to become smaller so they could cool down easier; others evolved to life in water for that same effect. The latter group included some of the most bizarre forms of reptiles that would go on to become extinct such as a giant, long-necked marine reptile once thought to be the Loch Ness monster, a tiny chameleon-like creature with a bird-like skull and beak, and a gliding reptile resembling a gecko with wings. It also includes the ancestors of reptiles that still exist today like turtles and crocodiles.

Smaller reptiles, which gave rise to the first lizards and tuataras, went on a different path than their larger reptile brethren. Their evolutionary rates slowed down and stabilized in response to the rising temperatures. The researchers believe it was because the small-bodied reptiles were already better adapted to the rising heat since they can more easily release heat from their bodies compared to larger reptiles when temperatures got hot very quickly all-around Earth.

The researchers say they are planning to expand on this work investigating the impact of environmental catastrophes on evolution of organisms with abundant modern diversity, such as the major groups of lizards and snakes."

Global warming triggered the age of the dinosaurs, according to new research.

Rising temperatures caused ancient reptiles to diversify - leading to the biggest creatures that ever walked the Earth.

An analysis of more than 1,000 fossils found climate change kick-started their evolution - rather than mass extinctions.

The finding has implications for today. Animals have already started shape-shifting to cope with weather-linked stresses.

Co-author Professor Stephanie Pierce, of Harvard University in the US, said: ""Major shifts in global temperature can have dramatic and varying impacts on biodiversity.

""Here we show rising temperatures during the Permian-Triassic led to the extinction of many animals, including many of the ancestors of mammals, but also sparked the explosive evolution of others, especially the reptiles that went on to dominate the Triassic period.""

Life almost came to an end 252 million years ago when at least 90 percent of all species were wiped out.

Massive volcanic eruptions heated the whole planet. The rate of carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere now is about nine times more.

Dinosaurs began emerging about 20 million years later. They went on to rule for 165 million years.

The US team described it as ""one heck of a coming out party"" - for reptiles. They ranged

from primitive crocodiles with massive bone-crushing jaws to tiny cousins that took to the air.

Lead author Dr. Tiago Simoes, from the same lab, said: ""We are suggesting we have two major factors at play - not just this open ecological opportunity that has always been thought by several scientists but also something that nobody had previously come up with.

""Climate change actually directly triggered the adaptive response of reptiles to help build this vast array of new body plans and the explosion of groups that we see in the Triassic.""

They colonized the land, sea and air. They include tiny lizards - and 60-foot ocean monsters called ichthyosaurs.

They survived three major extinctions and are found on every continent, but Australia. There are over 10,000 species today, not counting birds - that descended from dinosaurs.

The study, published in the journal Science Advances, reveals for the first time how their bodies changed in response to millions of years of climate change.

Pierce and colleagues tracked this back to rising global temperatures - years before any mass extinction events.

They identified vast anatomical alterations that took place in many groups - including the forerunners of crocodiles and dinosaurs.

It was in direct response to major climate shifts concentrated between 260 to 230 million years ago - shedding fresh light on how they caused organisms to evolve.

Recent research by the University of Sheffield found birds are adapting to global warming by developing bigger beaks - which help keep them cool.

Australian scientists revealed elephants and rabbits are coping - by turning into 'Dumbo' and 'Bugs Bunny'. They are growing bigger ears.

Elephants use them as fans - while an extensive network of blood vessels contract in rabbits to cool them down.

Dr. Simoes described his eight-year study as ""especially pertinent today"" as temperatures continually rise.

It combined camerawork, CT scans, and visits to over 50 different museums in more than 20 countries with global temperature data from millions of years ago.

State-of-the-art statistical techniques produced an 'evolutionary time tree'. It reveals how early reptiles were related to each other when their lineages first originated and how fast they were evolving.

Researchers in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology and the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University published a study in the Sciences Advances journal on Aug. 19 that revealed the Age of Reptiles began in connection with increasing global temperatures spurred by a series of climatic changes between the Permian and Triassic periods.

Synapsids, the ancestors of mammals, were the dominant land vertebrates of the Permian Period. Previously, most paleontologists had attributed the explosion of reptile diversity in the Triassic Period (252-200 million years ago) to the mass extinctions of the Permian Period (298-252 million years ago) that wiped out many competitor synapsid species, giving reptilians the resources and habitats needed to make them the dominant group of land vertebrates.

But the new study challenges this assertion.

""Our results reveal that periods of fast climatic shifts and global warming are associated with exceptionally high rates of anatomical change in most groups of reptiles as they adapted to new environmental conditions,"" senior author and Harvard Professor Stephanie E. Pierce said. ""This process started long before the Permian-Triassic extinction, since at least 270 million years ago, indicating that the diversification of reptile body plans was not triggered by the P-T extinction event as previously thought, but in fact started tens of million years before that.""

Researchers can use such findings of climate change-induced mass extinctions from the geological past to understand modern impacts of climate change and global warming on organismal evolution, the researchers said. Previous studies into the impact of climate change on species had mostly centered on the impact on marine species and left out terrestrial vertebrates due to lack of data. Ongoing studies can help us understand the future of reptilian evolution.

The climate crisis is no longer something happening elsewhere, to someone else, in the future – it is happening here, to us, now.

The plan, which sets the direction for climate action for the next 15 years, requires the transport sector to reduce emissions by more than 40% by 2035 compared with 2019.

Meanwhile, in the same month, Ford launched the “New Zealand Drives A Ranger” campaign for its mainly diesel-powered, high-emission double cab ute. The Ranger remains the country’s top-selling new vehicle, and average CO 2 emissions of the new line are higher than before through the inclusion of a V6 model.

We have a problem. On the one hand, climate action requires rapid, deep reductions in greenhouse pollution. At the same time, businesses lean in the other direction if they sense rapid decarbonisation threatens their commercial success.

Business as usual

This conflict between urgency and business as usual will be difficult to resolve.

As temperatures rise, living conditions for many people may become intolerable. Sharp emissions reductions must be made this decade to give the world a reasonable chance of staying within 1.5 to 2 degrees of warming.

But fossil fuels are embedded in most aspects of everyday life. This includes construction, food production, transport and the IT sector (Google emits about 10 million tons of CO 2 equivalent a year).

Failure to act on the tensions between public policy and commercial interests may well obstruct effective climate action.

Some business groups are powerful advocates for sustainability, and some are effective leaders in the community on climate change. But there are plenty of examples of industries deliberately undermining policies aimed at reducing pollution.

The coordinated efforts of oil companies over many decades to interfere with climate science are well documented. Greenwashing, a milder version of the same delaying tactics, is widespread.

Media ‘camouflage’

There are subtler ways of stalling progress on the climate, too: working to establish a dominant narrative – “New Zealanders love cars”, for instance – or media sponsorship that creates a dependence on corporate income.

Political lobbying isn’t always publicly visible, either. As investigative journalist Nicky Hagar’s 2014 book Dirty Politics described, certain business groups paid third party agitators to attack public health professionals working on food, alcohol and tobacco harm.

Even companies leading on emissions reduction have been accused of exaggerating their actions rather than having to “pivot without precedent” on climate change.

Asked why national greenhouse emissions have not fallen in 30 years, despite vastly increased knowledge about the causes and consequences of climate change, veteran environmentalist Guy Salmon said in 2021:

We have built into our culture an unwillingness to take responsibility for these things and have a very strong deference to vested interests.

This deference includes a kind of media “camouflage”. A 2017 survey found business groups such as Federated Farmers, the Chamber of Commerce and the Food and Grocery Council were seldom, if ever, identified as lobbyists in news stories.

More common were neutral descriptions such as “farmer body”, “voice of business” and “stakeholder”. If lobby groups are given publicity but not identified for what they are, it is difficult for the public to understand what’s at stake and why opinions on controversial issues differ.

A continuum of risk

How to respond? The work of Peter Adams, a professor of social and community health at the University of Auckland, can be helpful here. He has studied how to manage conflicts of interest that arise when accepting funds from industries that trade, in his words, in “dangerous consumption”.

Adams argues that the first step is a simple one: to acknowledge the potential for conflicts of interest. When there are differences between business interests and the public good we should say so, whether this occurs in universities, the media, community organisations, advertising or elsewhere.

Read more: NZ's first climate adaptation plan is a good start, but crucial questions about cost and timing must be answered

Second, Adams argues against binary thinking that separates the world into “safe” and “unsafe” options. While it may be tempting to simplify like this, the black and white approach is not helpful because it is seldom true.

Mostly there is a continuum of risk, and decisions about what is acceptable or not depend on a host of factors such as context, timing and trade-offs.

Adams offers a framework to help wrestle with these difficult choices. It includes three considerations I think are particularly relevant to climate change: the degree to which interests diverge, the severity of environmental harm that results, and the risk of commercial or political interests compromising organisations’ decision making.

Asking hard questions

As the climate crisis intensifies, New Zealand faces some serious questions:

Should lobbying be controlled?

Should the advertising of carbon-intensive products be banned?

When should business be excluded from government committees?

How should the public be better informed about the environmental performance of industry?

What sanctions should apply to scientific disinfomation?

When is it not acceptable to take funding from carbon-polluting companies?

There are no clear cut answers, meaning solutions will be necessarily political and contestable. What’s important is to recognise conflicting interests exist and that they may have harmful consequences, especially in a time of climate urgency.

To reduce the risk from a worsening climate, we must be frank about the interests and imperatives of business, and be ready to apply regulation and legislation to protect the public good."

Newly juiced subsidies for carbon capture and storage have led to renewed hostilities within environmental groups and the Democratic Party over whether it is a properly green technology or a handout to fossil fuel companies.

Among the hundreds of billions in grants, loans, and other green energy subsidies passed in Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act is an expanded 45Q tax credit, which incentivizes firms to capture, store, or utilize their carbon dioxide emissions for other industrial processes rather than allow emissions to escape into the atmosphere. CCS, sometimes also called CCUS to include ""utilization,"" has been widely embraced by sectors that rely on fossil fuels, including energy producers, utilities, and manufacturers, as a way to reduce their environmental footprints.

However, some academics and environmental groups have deemed CCS a failed technology for not being more widely in use after Congress allocated billions to fund demonstration projects. They also consider carbon capture also to be a license for oil and gas companies to keep on drilling and are lobbying against more subsidies now that the government will be devoting more money to it.

DROUGHT AND GRID UNRELIABILITY FORCE THREE MAJOR CHANGES IN CALIFORNIA ENERGY POLICY

The new law increases credit values to $85 per ton for industrial facilities and power plants that capture carbon and store it in geologic formations. It also raises credit values to $60 per ton of captured carbon for both generic utilization and for a process known as enhanced oil recovery, whereby captured carbon is then injected back into the ground for oil production.

The changed credit also extends eligibility for projects to 2033 so that any project that commences construction before Jan. 1 of that year can claim the credit, and it allows for a novel ""direct pay"" option.

Pro-CCUS groups like the Carbon Capture Coalition, a group of more than 100 companies, unions, and environmental policy organizations that support carbon management technologies, praised the expanded credits, as did some oil and gas industry groups that otherwise had little nice to say about the bill.

The American Petroleum Institute, the most influential U.S. oil and gas trade group, said the bill ""takes important steps"" in favor of CCS, although it opposed the overall bill.

At the same time, skeptics and outright opponents of CCS have been arguing against more subsidies, arguing that taxpayers are funding a technology that encourages the continued extraction of oil and gas against the preferences of much of the Democratic Party and its green coalition to more quickly phase out fossil fuels.

Jim Walsh, policy director for environmental nongovernmental organization Food & Water Watch, stressed that the installation of carbon capture would itself require huge amounts of electricity, including demand that would be met by burning more fossil fuels.

""Carbon capture is not an energy generator — it is an energy user,"" Walsh told the Washington Examiner. Instead, money dedicated to CCS could be better used to develop more renewable generating sources, he said.

Furthermore, Charles Harvey, a professor of environmental engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Kurt House, CEO of metals exploration company KoBold Metals, published an op-ed in the New York Times on Tuesday that called CCS a ""counterproductive waste of money.""

CCS allows ""for the continued production of oil and natural gas at a time when the world should be ending its dependence on fossil fuels,"" the two wrote.

""By promoting C.C.S., the fossil fuel industry is slowing the transition away from fossil fuels,"" Harvey and House said, also noting the failure or closure of several industrial and power generation projects that received government funding to demonstrate CCS.

Pro-CCS groups have argued that the technology more or less meets the economy where it's at.

""The truth is, the overwhelming majority of our energy consumption today is based on fossil energy, with roughly one-third of that driven by the industrial and commercial sectors,"" the Carbon Action Project wrote in a blog post it circulated Thursday in response to Harvey and House. ""Carbon capture is a technological solution available right now to address just that.""

The blog also dismissed the notion that Congress is devaluing renewable energy by devoting resources to CCS, saying also that critics undervalue carbon capture for industrial uses.

""As it stands right now, implementing carbon capture for industrial heat, for example, is the only real competitive, commercially-available option,"" the Carbon Action Project said.

CCS has bipartisan support in Congress, although no Republicans voted in favor of the Democrats' sweeping new green energy, tax, and healthcare law.

The new law also increased the value of incentives for another carbon management technology, direct air capture, which removes carbon dioxide directly from the air rather than capturing it from an industrial process.

The technology, which is currently very expensive, was recently dubbed the ""holy grail"" by ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods."
8f3ccb58-c616-4652-85b3-ca3c39084540,"Scientists have warned that Australians can expect more shortages of fresh food for some time to come as climate change creates increasingly unpredictable weather.

The Bureau of Meteorology announced this week it was moving from a La Nina ‘watch’ to an ‘alert’ phase, now estimating a 70 per cent chance that a rare third consecutive La Nina weather event would occur before the end of the year.

It’s the final phase before the bureau officially declares a La Nina event.

On Friday morning new Australian research was published warning of the wide-reaching consequences climate change and associated wild weather could have on Australia’s food supply chains and food availability.

Fruit, vegetables and livestock under threat

The study, published by international science journal Nature Food and funded by the NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment, assessed potential disruptions to the food supply chain that could arise following various weather scenarios.

The researcher found that the fruit, vegetable and livestock sectors would be the greatest affected in the event of wild weather.

In the Murray-Darling Basin region of New South Wales, for example, the study projected that there could be a 43 per cent reduction in meat production and 45 per cent reduction in wool production by 2030 due to climate change.

It also said that extreme heatwaves could cause a 40 per cent decrease in the output of dairy and cattle farming in parts of NSW, and a 25 per cent decrease in apple and pear crops in the Murray-Darling Basin region of Victoria.

Farmers are already feeling the stress brought on by extreme weather, some in NSW and Queensland losing entire harvests amid the devastating floods earlier this year.

Many were unable to replant due to the unrelenting conditions and sodden soil.

Weather has been far from the only factor plaguing food supply chains.

Various global events, such as the war in Ukraine, have exposed the vulnerability in our food supply systems.

The war in Ukraine sent oil prices skyrocketing, for example, and international travel restrictions brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic have limited migrant labour.

Rising prices

Rachel Carey, senior lecturer in food systems at the University of Melbourne’s School of Agriculture and Food, said it was important to recognise the cumulative effect that these various stressors were having on the agriculture industry.

‘‘I think that we need to be aware of the cumulative impacts here of multiple different shocks and stresses that have been affecting the food system. So we’re seeing more shocks and stress, with less time for recovery in between,’’ Dr Carey said.

‘‘I think it’s important that we recognise that it’s the cumulative impacts that are really having an effect on farmers and our food system and the prices.’’

With Australia highly dependent on its domestic supply of fresh produce, Dr Carey said shoppers may soon see prices escalate even further.

‘‘We’ve seen prices increase quite significantly over the last few months after flooding on the east coast. And one concern might be that we see significant flooding during the spring planting season, [and] the impacts might be there as well,’’ she said.

Factors such as low land availability and severe flooding and vicious droughts would only continue to drive up prices, she said.

‘‘[With] less land available to grow food, overall a trend for less water, not during the floods, but overall … all these things are affecting the price of our food and likely to continue to do so.’’

Nutrition and accessibility at risk

Along with rising prices come concerns that nutritious food will become less accessible, particularly in rural areas.

The study found that communities in rural areas would be the most affected as prices continued to rise, with less financial capital to obtain fresh, nourishing food.

Households with higher income would have the ability to obtain expensive goods among short-term shortages, it was found, while low-income households would struggle to do so.

Dr Carey said there needs to be sufficient forward planning to account for rising food prices.

“We also need to be thinking about the impacts that these rising food prices have – [namely] peoples’ ability to access sufficient, healthy food,” she said.

‘‘We’ve seen rising food insecurity recently. That has been a relatively hidden problem in Australia in the past, [but] it has always been there. But it is rising with the shocks and stresses and with impacts on food prices. And I think we need to really look at how we address that issue as a country.’’"

Summer is in full swing in the U.S., and people are turning up their air conditioners to beat the heat. But the hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants in these and other cooling devices are potent greenhouse gases and major drivers of climate change. Today, scientists report a prototype device that could someday replace existing ""A/Cs."" It's much more environmentally friendly and uses solid refrigerants to efficiently cool a space.

The researchers will present their results today at the fall meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS).

""Just installing an air conditioner or throwing one away is a huge driver of global warming,"" says Adam Slavney, Ph.D., who is presenting this work at the meeting. The refrigerants used in these systems are thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide and can accidentally leak out of systems when they are being handled or disposed of.

Traditional cooling systems, such as air conditioners, work by causing a refrigerant to cycle between being a gas or a liquid. When the liquid becomes a gas, it expands and absorbs heat, cooling a room or the interior of a refrigerator. A compressor that works at about 70–150 pounds per square inch (psi) turns the gas back into a liquid, releasing heat. In the case of air conditioners, this heat is directed outside the home. Though this cycle is efficient, concerns about climate change and stricter regulations on hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants are spurring the search for more environmentally responsible ones.

Solid refrigerants could be an ideal solution. Unlike gases, solids won't leak into the environment from A/C units. One class of solid refrigerants, called barocaloric materials, work similarly to traditional gas-liquid cooling systems. They use pressure changes to go through heat cycles, but in this case, the pressure drives a solid-to-solid phase change. That means the material remains a solid, but the internal molecular structure changes. The key structural aspect of these barocaloric solid materials is that they contain long, flexible molecular chains that are typically floppy and disordered. But under pressure, the chains become more ordered and rigid—a change that releases heat. The process of going from an ordered to a relaxed structure is like melting wax, but without it becoming a liquid, says Jarad Mason, Ph.D., the project's principal investigator, who is at Harvard University. When the pressure is released, the material reabsorbs heat, completing the cycle.

A disadvantage of barocaloric systems, however, is that most of these materials require massive pressures to drive heat cycles. To produce these pressures, the systems need expensive, specialized equipment that's not practical for real-world cooling applications. Mason and his team recently reported barocaloric materials that can act as refrigerants at much lower pressures. They've now shown that the refrigerants, which are called metal-halide perovskites, can work in a cooling system they've built from scratch. ""The materials we reported are able to cycle at about 3,000 psi, which are pressures that a typical hydraulics system can work at,"" says Slavney.

The team has now built a first-of-its-kind prototype that demonstrates the use of these new materials in a practical cooling system. The device has three main parts. One is a metal tube packed with the solid refrigerant and an inert liquid—water or an oil. Another piece of the device is a hydraulic piston that applies pressure to the liquid. Finally, the liquid helps transfer that pressure to the refrigerant and helps carry heat through the system.

After solving several engineering challenges, the team has shown that the barocaloric materials work as functional refrigerants, turning pressure changes into full temperature-changing cycles. ""Our system still doesn't use pressures as low as those of commercial refrigeration systems, but we're getting closer,"" says Mason. To the team's knowledge, this is the first working cooling system using solid-state refrigerants that rely on pressure changes.

With the device now in hand, the team plans to test a variety of barocaloric materials. ""We're really hoping to use this machine as a testbed to help us find even better materials,"" says Slavney, including ones that work at lower pressures and that conduct heat better. With an optimal material, the researchers believe solid-state refrigerants could become a viable replacement for current air conditioning and other cooling technologies.

Climate scenarios produced by BP, Royal Dutch Shell, and Equinor on global future energy use are incompatible with Paris Agreement goals for a safe and habitable planet, according to new research.

Global decarbonisation scenarios outlined by the energy companies show delayed reductions in fossil fuel consumption and run the risk of overshooting vital climate goals, according to a study by research organisation Climate Analytics and Imperial College London researchers.

Scenarios are produced by public, commercial and academic institutions and project what future energy requirements, and resultant emissions, would look like.

The scenarios are built by predicting future energy requirements for different economic sectors, such as agriculture and manufacturing, and projecting what energy sources would be needed to supply them, such as fossil fuels, nuclear, or renewable power. These projections of the future energy mix are then used to estimate what the resultant carbon emissions would be.

Fossil fuel companies have produced their own scenarios for future world energy consumption for decades, but in recent years they have moved to include decarbonisation objectives and resulting climate outcomes.

Now, researchers have analysed six scenarios published between 2020 and mid-2021 and calculated what the temperature outcomes for these scenarios are.

In 2015 almost all of the world’s countries pledged to limit global warming to “well below” 2degrees Celsius and to strive to keep temperatures at 1.5C by the end of the century as part of the historic Paris Agreement. The global temperature has risen on average 1.2C since the beginning of industrial times in the mid-19th century.

The scenarios include four from the oil majors (two from BP, one from Royal Dutch Shell, and one from Equinor), and two developed by the International Energy Agency (IEA). The results show that most of the evaluated scenarios would be classified as ‘Lower 2C pathways’ - pathways that keep peak warming below 2C, with a 66 per cent likelihood or more.

Dr Robert Brecha, co-lead author of the study from Climate Analytics, said: “Most of the scenarios we evaluated would be classified as inconsistent with the Paris Agreement as they fail to limit warming to ‘well below 2C’, let alone 1.5C, and would exceed the 1.5C warming limit by a significant margin.”

Only the International Energy Agency (IEA) Net Zero 2050 scenario is aligned with the criteria for Paris Agreement consistency that the researchers applied in the study.

Bill Hare, CEO and Senior Scientist at Climate Analytics, said: “Even temporarily exceeding the 1.5C warming would lead to catastrophic impacts and severely weaken our ability to adapt to climate change.”

Co-author Dr Robin Lamboll, from the Centre for Environmental Policy at Imperial, said: “It’s good that traditionally fossil-based institutions are planning for the upcoming transition to clean energy.

“However, it’s important that we don’t allow oil companies to mark their own work when providing suggestions for how the world can transition away from fossil fuels in a way that meets the Paris Agreement. It’s also important to be aware of these biases when databases of scenarios like this are used to frame what is possible and what is ‘radical’ in terms of climate goals.”

BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — The U.S. oil industry hit a legal roadblock in January when a judge struck down a $192 million oil and natural gas lease sale in the Gulf of Mexico over future global warming emissions from burning the fuels. It came at a pivotal time for Chevron, Exxon and other industry players: the Biden administration had curtailed opportunities for new offshore drilling, while raising climate change concerns.

The industry’s setback was short-lived, however. The climate measure President Joe Biden signed Tuesday bypasses the administration’s concerns about emissions and guarantees new drilling opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska. The legislation was crafted to secure backing from a top recipient of oil and gas donations, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, and was shaped in part by industry lobbyists.

While the Inflation Reduction Act concentrates on clean energy incentives that could drastically reduce overall U.S. emissions , it also buoys oil and gas interests by mandating leasing of vast areas of public lands and off the nation’s coasts. And it locks renewables and fossil fuels together: If the Biden administration wants solar and wind on public lands, it must offer new oil and gas leases first.

As a result, U.S. oil and gas production and emissions from burning fuels could keep growing, according to some industry analysts and climate experts. With domestic demand sliding, that means more fossil fuels exported to growing foreign markets, including from the Gulf where pollution from oil and gas activity plagues many poor and minority communities.

To the industry, the new law signals Democrats are willing to work with them and to abandon the notion fossil fuels could soon be rendered obsolete, said Andrew Gillick with Enverus, an energy analytics company whose data is used by industry and government agencies.

“The folks that think oil and gas will be gone in 10 years may not be thinking through what this means,” Gillick said. “Both supply and demand will increase over the next decade.”

The result would be more planet-warming carbon dioxide — up to 110 million tons (100 million metric tons) annually — from U.S.-produced oil and gas by 2030, with most coming from fuel burned after export, according to some economists and analysts.

ADVERTISEMENT

A Department of Energy analysis obtained by The Associated Press Thursday said the law’s leasing provisions “may lead to some increase” in carbon pollution, but that other provisions would cut 35 tons of greenhouse gas for every new ton of fossil fuel pollution.

The law reinstates within 30 days the 2,700-square miles (6,950-square kilometers) of Gulf leases that had been withheld. It ensures companies like Chevron will have the chance to expand and overrides the concerns of U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras that the government was “barreling full-steam ahead” without adequately considering global emission increases.

The measure’s importance was underscored by Chevron executives during a recent earnings call, where they predicted continued growth in the Gulf and tied that directly to being able “to lease and acquire additional acreage.”

The fossil fuel industry’s ambitions are now directly linked to wind and solar development: The bill prohibits leasing of federal lands and waters for renewable energy unless the government has offered at least 2 million acres (810,000 hectares) of public land and 60 million acres (24 million hectares) in federal waters for oil and gas leasing during the prior year. The law does not require leases to be sold, only offered for sale.

The measure’s critics say that’s holding renewables hostage unless the fossil fuel industry gets its way. Some accuse Biden and Democrats of abandoning pledges to confront the industry.

“It’s 10 more years of mandatory leases,” said Brett Hartl with the Center for Biological Diversity. “We will do our damnedest but it’s hard to fight them all.”

Communities near polluting industrial plants will continue to suffer if the oil and gas industry remains vibrant, said Beverly Wright, executive director of the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice and a member of the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council. She worries that incentives in the law for technology that captures carbon from industrial processes could also perpetuate harm to these poor, mostly minority residents.

In Louisiana’s St. James Parish, where petrochemical plants dominate the landscape, environmental justice activist Sharon Lavigne said the legislation will allow pollution from fossil fuels to keep harming her community.

“That’s just like saying they’re going to continue to poison us, going to continue to cause us cancer,” said Lavigne, a former high school teacher who founded the group Rising St. James.

The leasing provisions mark a failure in efforts by environmentalists and social justice advocates to impose a nationwide leasing ban. The movement’s high point came when Biden followed campaign pledges to end new drilling on federal lands with an order his first week in office suspending lease sales.

U.S. District Judge Terry Doughty in Lake Charles, Louisiana blocked Biden’s order nationwide last year. A federal appeals court Wednesday struck down Doughty’s ruling, then Thursday he issued a new injunction saying lease sales can’t be stopped in the 13 states that opposed Biden’s policy.

A stream of potential drilling sites is crucial for companies to maintain future production because wells can take years to develop and some yield nothing, said Jim Noe, an industry lobbyist who worked with Senate staff on the climate bill’s leasing provisions.

“The industry is in constant need — almost like a treadmill — of lease sales,” said Noe, an attorney at Holland & Knight who represented offshore oil and gas companies. Noe said demand for oil and gas won’t decline immediately and Gulf drilling brings jobs and more energy security.

A United Nations report before Biden took office warned that the U.S. and other nations need to sharply decrease investments in oil, gas and coal to keep temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times.

Other bill provisions that focus on renewable energy and capturing carbon dioxide from industrial plants would result in net emission reductions 10 to 50 times greater than emission increases from burning more oil and gas, analysts say.

The increase in oil and gas emissions still could be substantial — as much as 77 million to 110 million tons (70 to 100 million metric tons) of additional carbon dioxide annually by 2030 from new leasing, according to economist Brian Prest with the research group Resources for the Future.

Other experts had lower projections: The San Francisco-based climate research group Energy Innovation predicted up to 55 million tons (50 million metric tons) of additional carbon dioxide annually from new leasing. Researchers from Princeton and Dartmouth said the impact could be negligible or as much as 22 million tons (20 million metric tons) in the U.S., plus much more abroad.

Any increase hinges on global oil and natural gas prices staying high — and that in turn depends on a range of factors including the ongoing war in Ukraine, said Robbie Orvis with Energy Innovation.

“It may increase oil and gas production somewhat, but that is very much offset by all of the other pieces of the bill,” Orvis said.

Yet there’s uncertainty about how quickly other pieces of the bill could bring emission cuts. Wind and solar construction could run into the supply chain problems hindering many economic sectors. And technology to capture and store carbon dioxide is still being refined and is in limited use.

Other provisions could make it potentially more expensive to drill on public lands and waters. There are modest increases in royalty and rental rates and a new $5-per-acre fee when companies want particular parcels offered for lease. Another fee would require companies to pay for natural gas, or methane, that enters the atmosphere as a potent greenhouse gas.

The higher costs could dampen interest among companies, said Mark Squillace, a natural resources law professor at University of Colorado Law School.

“Even though the industry is going to be getting more oil and gas leasing if they want it, it’s an interesting question: Do they want it?” Squillace asked.

f8cf9d4c-aad7-484a-b2a5-1f88029903f6,"Several major oil companies, including BP and Shell, periodically publish scenarios forecasting the future of the energy sector. In recent years, they have added visions for how climate change might be addressed, including scenarios that they claim are consistent with the international Paris climate agreement.

These scenarios are hugely influential. They are used by companies making investment decisions and, importantly, by policymakers as a basis for their decisions.

But are they really compatible with the Paris Agreement?

Many of the future scenarios show continued reliance on fossil fuels. But data gaps and a lack of transparency can make it difficult to compare them with independent scientific assessments, such as the global reviews by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

In a study published Aug. 16, 2022, in Nature Communications, our international team analyzed four of these scenarios and two others by the International Energy Agency using a new method we developed for comparing such energy scenarios head-to-head. We determined that five of them – including frequently cited scenarios from BP, Shell and Equinor – were not consistent with the Paris goals.

What the Paris Agreement expects

The 2015 Paris Agreement, signed by nearly all countries, sets out a few criteria to meet its objectives.

One is to ensure the global average temperature increase stays well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 F) compared to pre-industrial era levels, and to pursue efforts to keep warming under 1.5°C (2.7 F). The agreement also states that global emissions should peak as soon as possible and reach at least net zero greenhouse gas emissions in the second half of the century. Pathways that meet these objectives show that carbon dioxide emissions should fall even faster, reaching net zero by about 2050.

Scientific evidence shows that overshooting 1.5°C of warming, even temporarily, would have harmful consequences for the global climate. Those consequences are not necessarily reversible, and it’s unclear how well people, ecosystems and economies would be able to adapt.

How the scenarios perform

We have been working with the nonprofit science and policy research institute Climate Analytics to better understand the implications of the Paris Agreement for global and national decarbonization pathways – the paths countries can take to cut their greenhouse gas emissions. In particular, we have explored the roles that coal and natural gas can play as the world transitions away from fossil fuels.

When we analyzed the energy companies’ decarbonization scenarios, we found that BP’s, Shell’s and Equinor’s scenarios overshoot the 1.5°C limit of the Paris Agreement by a significant margin, with only BP’s having a greater than 50% chance of subsequently drawing temperatures down to 1.5°C by 2100.

These scenarios also showed higher near-term use of coal and long-term use of gas for electricity production than Paris-compatible scenarios, such as those assessed by the IPCC. Overall, the energy company scenarios also feature higher levels of carbon dioxide emissions than Paris-compatible scenarios.

Of the six scenarios, we determined that only the International Energy Agency’s Net Zero by 2050 scenario sketches out an energy future that is compatible with the 1.5°C Paris Agreement goal.

We found this scenario has a greater than 33% chance of keeping warming from ever exceeding 1.5°C, a 50% chance of having temperatures 1.5°C warmer or less in 2100, and a nearly 90% chance of keeping warming always below 2°C. This is in line with the criteria we use to assess Paris Agreement consistency, and also in line with the approach taken in the IPCC’s Special Report on 1.5°C, which highlights pathways with no or limited overshoot to be 1.5°C compatible.

Getting the right picture of decarbonization

When any group publishes future energy scenarios, it’s useful to have a transparent way to make an apples-to-apples comparison and evaluate the temperature implications. Most of the corporate scenarios, with the exception of Shell’s Sky 1.5 scenario, don’t extend beyond midcentury and focus on carbon dioxide without assessing other greenhouse gases.

Our method uses a transparent procedure to extend each pathway to 2100 and estimate emissions of other gases, which allows us to calculate the temperature outcomes of these scenarios using simple climate models.

Without a consistent basis for comparison, there is a risk that policymakers and businesses will have an inaccurate picture about the pathways available for decarbonizing economies.

Meeting the 1.5°C goal will be challenging. The planet has already warmed about 1.1°C since pre-industrial times, and people are suffering through deadly heat waves, droughts, wildfires and extreme storms linked to climate change. There is little room for false starts and dead-ends as countries transform their energy, agricultural and industrial systems on the way to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions."

DECARBONISATION SCENARIOS Decarbonisation scenarios are visions or scenarios of how to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by replacing fossil fuels in the energy system. They are produced by public, commercial and academic institutions and project what future energy requirements, and resultant emissions, would look like. These scenarios inform planning across the globe by governments and other organisations aiming to determine how rapidly different sectors must reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Hitting the Paris Agreement targets is seen as key to averting a planetary catastrophe, leading to devastation in the form of frequent climate disasters and millions of deaths.

Fossil fuel companies have produced their own scenarios for future global energy consumption for decades, but the underlying assumptions of the scenarios to back up their claims that they're consistent with the Paris Agreement are 'not always clear', the researchers say.

For example, in 2020, BP detailed multiple decarbonisation scenarios in a report, including 'Net Zero' and 'Rapid'.

And in 2021, Shell released its emissions reduction plan, called 'Sky 1.5', that outlined how the world could meet the 'well-below 2°C' goal.

For the study, the experts analysed a total of six decarbonisation scenarios published between 2020 and mid-2021.

Four were from the energy firms (two from BP, one from Shell and one from Equinor), while another two were developed by the International Energy Agency (IEA), an intergovernmental organisation based in France.

Researchers calculated what the temperature outcomes for the six scenarios are and how they compare with temperature outcomes to the objectives of the Paris Agreement.

They found that five of the six scenarios assessed overshoot the 1.5°C (2.7°F) warming limit by a significant margin.

Only the IEA's 'Net Zero by 2050' scenario is aligned with the Paris Agreement target of limiting warming to 1.5°C, they found.

Equinor's 'Rebalance' scenario peaks at a median warming of 1.73°C above pre-industrial levels in 2060, BP's 'Rapid' at 1.73°C in 2058, Shell's 'Sky' at 1.81°C in 2069, and the IEA's sustainable development scenario (SDS) at 1.78°C in 2056.

BP's Net Zero scenario results in a median peak warming of 1.65°C, not quite low enough to be consistent with the Paris Agreement criteria.

'Institutional assessments have historically been opaque on climate outcomes,' said co-author Dr Matthew Gidden at Climate Analytics.

'Our study provides a direct line of sight from pathways to temperature.

'Governments should use these tools to carry out a robust assessment of the energy-system transformation to meet the Paris Agreement goals.'

DECARBONISATION SCENARIOS Decarbonisation scenarios are visions or scenarios of how to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by replacing fossil fuels in the energy system. They are produced by public, commercial and academic institutions and project what future energy requirements, and resultant emissions, would look like. These scenarios inform planning across the globe by governments and other organisations aiming to determine how rapidly different sectors must reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Decarbonisation scenarios are built by predicting future energy requirements for different economic sectors, such as agriculture and manufacturing, and projecting what energy sources would be needed to supply them, such as fossil fuels, nuclear, or renewable power. These projections of the future energy mix are then used to estimate what the resultant carbon emissions would be. Fossil fuel companies have produced their own scenarios for future global energy consumption for decades, but the underlying assumptions of the scenarios to back up their claims that they're consistent with the Paris Agreement are 'not always clear', the researchers say.

Hitting the Paris Agreement targets is seen as key to averting a planetary catastrophe, leading to devastation in the form of frequent climate disasters and millions of deaths.

The study was led by researchers at Climate Analytics and Imperial College London, and published today in Nature Communications.

'Most of the scenarios we evaluated would be classified as inconsistent with the Paris Agreement,' said study author Dr Robert Brecha at Climate Analytics.

'They fail to limit warming to well below 2°C, let alone 1.5°C, and would exceed the 1.5°C warming limit by a significant margin.'

Fossil fuel companies have produced their own scenarios for future global energy consumption for decades, but the underlying assumptions of the scenarios to back up their claims that they're consistent with the Paris Agreement are 'not always clear', the researchers say.

For example, in 2020, BP detailed multiple decarbonisation scenarios in a report, including 'Net Zero' and 'Rapid'.

And in 2021, Shell released its emissions reduction plan, called 'Sky 1.5', that outlined how the world could meet the 'well-below 2°C' goal.

For the study, the experts analysed a total of six decarbonisation scenarios published between 2020 and mid-2021.

Four were from the energy firms (two from BP, one from Shell and one from Equinor), while another two were developed by the International Energy Agency (IEA), an intergovernmental organisation based in France.

Researchers calculated what the temperature outcomes for the six scenarios are and how they compare with temperature outcomes to the objectives of the Paris Agreement.

They found that five of the six scenarios assessed overshoot the 1.5°C (2.7°F) warming limit by a significant margin.

AMAZON'S CO2 EMISSIONS ARE INCREASING Amazon's carbon emissions grew 18 per cent in 2021, largely due to demand for its services during the Covid pandemic. In a new report, the Seattle tech giant has revealed it emitted 71.54 million metric tons of carbon-dioxide equivalent last year. This marks a 40 per cent rise, and the third straight year of increased emissions, since the company started sharing the figures back in 2019. Read more

Only the IEA's 'Net Zero by 2050' scenario is aligned with the Paris Agreement target of limiting warming to 1.5°C, they found.

Equinor's 'Rebalance' scenario peaks at a median warming of 1.73°C above pre-industrial levels in 2060, BP's 'Rapid' at 1.73°C in 2058, Shell's 'Sky' at 1.81°C in 2069, and the IEA's sustainable development scenario (SDS) at 1.78°C in 2056.

BP's Net Zero scenario results in a median peak warming of 1.65°C, not quite low enough to be consistent with the Paris Agreement criteria.

Results show that it's crucial fossil fuel companies aren't allowed to 'mark their own work', according to co-author Dr Robin Lamboll at Imperial.

'It's good that traditionally fossil-based institutions are planning for the upcoming transition to clean energy,' he said.

'However, it's important that we don't allow oil companies to mark their own work when providing suggestions for how the world can transition away from fossil fuels in a way that meets the Paris Agreement.

'It's also important to be aware of these biases when databases of scenarios like this are used to frame what is possible and what is 'radical' in terms of climate goals.'

According to the team, their study gives policymakers the tools to critically assess scenarios published by a number of public, commercial and academic institutions describing how they will meet the Paris Agreement goals.

'Institutional assessments have historically been opaque on climate outcomes,' said co-author Dr Matthew Gidden at Climate Analytics.

'Our study provides a direct line of sight from pathways to temperature.

'Governments should use these tools to carry out a robust assessment of the energy-system transformation to meet the Paris Agreement goals.'

MailOnline contacted Shell, BP and Equinor for comment.

Shell said it's transparent on how it models its decarbonisation scenarios, which it said are assessed by the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change.

BP and Equinor declined to comment."
8dcef506-4daf-4524-8a22-4a59a22a55e1,"The research suggested plans by some energy majors to decarbonise are not compatible with the Paris Agreement temperature goals.

Global decarbonisation scenarios envisioned by oil and gas majors are incompatible with the Paris climate deal temperature goals aimed at averting devastating heating, according to research published Tuesday.

The landmark 2015 accord saw nations commit to limit planetary heating to ""well below"" two degrees Celsius (3.6 Farenheit) above pre-industrial levels and to work towards a safer 1.5-C warming cap.

Writing in the journal Nature Communications, an international team of experts analysed six emissions scenarios from three European energy giants—Equinor, BP and Shell—as well as those produced by the International Energy Agency.

They then compared the analysed pathways to scenarios outlined in a special report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on 1.5C of warming.

The team used these to evaluate peak and end-of-century temperatures under each scenario, noting that average global temperatures may decline by 2100 in some scenarios after peaking.

They also assessed the underlying energy system changes that drive emissions and could lead to a given scenario meeting—or failing to meet—the Paris temperature goals.

""Most of the scenarios we evaluated would be classified as inconsistent with the Paris Agreement as they fail to limit warming to 'well below 2C', let alone 1.5C, and would exceed the 1.5C warming limit by a significant margin,"" said Robert Brecha of the Climate Analytics think tank and co-lead author of the study.

""Energy system transformation is critical to reaching the Paris Agreement warming limit, and decision makers need sound and transparent scientific assessments. This paper adds to that transparency.""

'Catastrophic impacts'

The analysis found that Shell's Sky scenario would lead to warming of 1.81C by 2069—a far cry from 1.5C.

A Shell spokeswoman told AFP that the Sky pathway was just one of several envisaged by the company.

The team responsible for modelling scenarios ""makes assessments based on plausible assumptions and quantifications, which are not intended to be predictions of likely future events or outcomes, let alone our energy transition plan"", she added.

Equinor's Rebalance scenario would see warming peak at 1.73C above pre-industrial levels by 2060, according to the study.

BP's Rapid scenario would see peak warming of 1.73C by 2058, while its Net Zero scenario would see median warming peak at 1.65C, the analysis found.

Equinor declined to comment, while BP did not respond to a comment request.

Only the IEA's Net Zero 2050 pathway is fully aligned with the Paris agreement's 1.5C goal, the authors concluded.

""Fossil fuel companies claim that we can continue to burn oil and gas while keeping to the 1.5C warming limit, and they cite their own scenarios as justification,"" said Bill Hare, CEO and Senior Scientist at Climate Analytics.

""But our research shows that their pathways would bust the Paris Agreement. Even temporarily exceeding the 1.5C warming would lead to catastrophic impacts and severely weaken our ability to adapt to climate change.""

1c327959-3f48-4627-b338-18d2bfb1ab01,"The federal government has begun consultations to reform Australia's safeguard mechanism which is expected to help achieve net zero emissions.

The mechanism applies to 215 facilities which produce more than 100,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases a year and was designed to ensure they reduce those emissions.

But while the mechanism's framework is sound, its implementation had failed under the previous government prompting a need for reform, Climate Change Minister Chris Bowen said.

""The world's climate emergency is Australia's jobs opportunity, and a revamped safeguard mechanism will help Australian industry cut emissions and remain competitive in a decarbonising global economy,"" he said in a statement on Thursday.

The industry-led Carbon Market Institute welcomed the government's consultation paper for reform.

Safeguard mechanism reforms are vital to accelerate emissions reductions, institute chief John Connor said.

""The design elements need to be carefully considered to ensure that the evolved scheme can drive industrial decarbonisation, support industry and enhance Australia's carbon competitiveness,"" he said.

Poor ambition and policy design has previously seen emissions from facilities covered by the safeguard mechanism increase, he added.

The safeguard reforms are scheduled to begin on July 1, 2023.

The government will also review the ability of large emitters to purchase international carbon credits.

Mr Bowen told ABC radio the government would have to be ""100 per cent satisfied"" credit schemes were credible and there were real emissions reductions to allow large emitters to use them.

Meanwhile, the climate change bill is under the microscope as a Senate inquiry into proposed emissions-reduction measures begins.

Science and environmental groups, as well as business bodies, unions and research panels provided evidence on possible improvements to the government's bill before it is debated in the upper house next month.

The proposed legislation, which passed the House of Representatives earlier this month, enshrines an emissions-reduction target of 43 per cent, based on 2005 levels, by 2030.

It also locks in plans to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and includes a requirement for the government to provide annual updates on how well the targets are on track.

The government must work with existing technologies to reduce emissions, Business Council of Australia chief Jennifer Westacott told the committee on Thursday.

While nuclear options shouldn't be ruled out in the future, the current priority should be to get to the emissions reduction target as quickly as possible, she said.

""We believe that we should be technology agnostic ... the current priority is to work with the known technologies, the scalable technologies ... but make sure we do not rule things out unnecessarily and we leave open the opportunity for technological advancement,"" she said.

The Clean Energy Council has also advocated for strengthened emissions targets.

""It is important that the 2030 target, and all future targets, represent a minimum level of achievement, rather than an upper bound on effort,"" a submission to the committee said.

The focus on improved climate change legislation comes as the Greens' deputy leader Mehreen Faruqi called on the government to put in place fuel-efficiency standards.

In a speech to the National Electric Vehicle Summit on Friday, Senator Faruqi will call for urgent investment in charging infrastructure and discounts on electric vehicles.

The Greens say investment of more than $1 billion is needed to support electric vehicle manufacturers in Australia.

""We need policies to push out old, dirty and obsolete vehicles and policies to bring in clean, better, more efficient electric vehicles,"" Senator Faruqi will say in the speech.

""We need the infrastructure to power up Australia's new electric vehicles and our vehicle manufacturing industry."""

b7fd20e7-a36a-4102-9396-c61634c55ddd,"The federal government's climate change bill should also come with a funding boost for further research into reducing emissions, Australia's peak science body has urged.

In a submission to a Senate committee examining the legislation, Science and Technology Australia said the bill should also have provisions of funding for future climate science research.

The body also called for an additional commitment to identify and highlight sectors that were making significant efforts to reduce emissions.

The legislation has enshrined a 43 per cent emissions reduction target by 2030, based on 2005 emission levels, along with net-zero by 2050.

The Senate committee is examining the legislation before it will be brought before the upper house for debate as soon as September.

Science and Technology Australia chief executive Mischa Schubert said the peak body supported the legislation, and urged for the transition to be as successful as possible.

""A deeper investment in Australia's outstanding climate scientists will ensure we continue to have the expertise we need to safeguard our economy, safety and prosperity,"" she said.

""We welcome the commitment that the 43 per cent target by 2030 is a floor, not a ceiling, for emissions reduction, and we strongly support ambition to bolster this target in coming years.""

The peak body said the boost to research should also be used to help guide not only the transition to emissions reduction, but also climate adaption and resilience building measures.

The legislation would also require for annual updates to how the government is meeting the climate change targets as outlined in the bill.

Ms Schubert said the statement should include sector-by-sector updates to highlight the areas that were making a successful transition.

""Naming and faming sectors making swift strides towards the target will highlight examples of industry leaders and spur momentum in Australia's transition,"" she said.

""It will also send a message that we are all working together to achieve a common goal and making genuine progress.""

The chief executive also raised the possibility of the annual statement including an update on developments in climate science.

""Parliamentarians and the public can be assured policy decisions are informed by the latest science,"" she said.

The first public hearing for the bill inquiry will be held in Canberra on Thursday."

The main conversation around climate change primarily focuses on one thing: how much carbon is in the air—and by extension, how to reduce it. However, what is less talked about but may become incredibly important is how much carbon is in our oceans. There is 50 times more carbon in the ocean than the atmosphere. Some climate researchers believe if we could just slightly increase the amount of carbon the ocean can absorb from the atmosphere, we could avoid some of the worst effects of climate change.

That might seem unusual when you first hear it, but think about it a bit longer. The ocean covers roughly 70 percent of the Earth’s surface, and it absorbs carbon dioxide naturally—effectively dissolving it. Phytoplankton in the ocean use this carbon dioxide and sunlight to run photosynthesis just like land-based plants. Oxygen is produced by this process—phytoplankton are actually responsible for about 50 percent of the oxygen in our atmosphere.

Some climate researchers have proposed that if we could just increase the amount of phytoplankton in the ocean, we could pull more carbon out of the atmosphere. A well-known way to produce a phytoplankton bloom is to introduce iron, an important nutrient for the plankton community, to the water. Many parts of the ocean are low in iron, so even a relatively small addition of iron could theoretically produce a lot of phytoplankton and thereby remove a lot of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

How to Weaponize Our Dying Oceans Against Climate Change

“Give me half a tanker of iron, and I’ll give you an ice age,” John Martin, an oceanographer at Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, wrote in 1988. Back then, most people were only just starting to become familiar with the idea of climate change as we now know it. But that’s also around the time people started to think about how iron fertilization could affect phytoplankton growth and, in turn, change atmospheric carbon levels.

Although climate scientists have spent quite a bit time discussing this strategy among themselves, there has not been a concerted effort to explore it further and take it seriously. Ken Buesseler, a marine radiochemist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, is a scientist who has done some research into iron fertilization in the ocean. He and his team looked at whether introducing iron could “alter the flux of carbon to the deep ocean” and found there was a significant carbon-sequestering effect.

Story continues

Buesseler told The Daily Beast that his research was done nearly 20 years ago, and there hasn’t been a whole lot since.

“What happened 20 years ago is we started going around and we would spread out a chemical form of iron and look for that phytoplankton—the plant response—and indeed it really showed very clearly that if you enhance the iron then you could create more uptake of carbon dioxide,” Buesseler said. “The difference between now and 20 years ago is that I think the climate crisis is so much more apparent to the public.”

Using the oceans to combat climate change has become a much-discussed topic among climate scientists in recent years, and Buesseler was part of a group of scientists that released a report through the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine late last year that looked at the available options, including increasing phytoplankton levels.

“We’ve got a big reservoir. It takes up a third of the greenhouse gasses already. The question that people are now asking more is what can we do to enhance that?” Buesseler said. “Let’s get out there. Let’s do experiments.”

The experiments themselves wouldn’t cause any harm to the ocean’s natural ecosystem, Buesseler said, but they could tell us a lot about how introducing more iron to the ocean on a much larger scale might affect that ecosystem in the long-term. He doesn’t believe doing this on a large scale would cause significant harm, but it’s important to get the research done so we can know that for sure. He said that a “very conservative” estimate would be that up to a gigaton of carbon dioxide could be sequestered every year if this process was done at scale.

“It will change the types of plants and animals that grow, but that is already happening with the changes in temperature and acidity,” Buesseler said.

David Siegel, a professor of marine science at the University of California, Santa Barbara, told The Daily Beast that iron fertilization would also be pretty easy to do. You could simply get a 120-foot fishing boat and start deploying the iron where it’ll be most effective for stimulating phytoplankton growth.

“It can be done relatively cheaply. Each atom of iron that you add in the right places can make tens of thousands of atoms of carbon get fixed,” meaning absorbed by the water. “It’s rather efficient,” Siegel said. “You can deploy vessels that release iron oxide into the water—even just iron ore into the water—and you can make blooms that you can see from space. We know that.”

Can a Future Fleet of Robotic Fish Clean Up the Ocean?

The effects would happen rather quickly. Scientists who have introduced iron to seawater in the past have seen that phytoplankton blooms can start becoming visible within the first 24 hours. The ideal place to introduce the iron would be where it’s least plentiful, which would be parts of the ocean—primarily in the southern hemisphere—that aren’t close to land. Iron that ends up in the ocean typically comes from dust that blows into the ocean from the land.

Both Buesseler and Siegel stressed that this should not be seen as an alternative to ending the use of fossil fuels. That is still critical when it comes to having a chance at beating climate change. But avoiding the worst effects of climate change will require also developing carbon removal strategies to reduce the load of greenhouse gasses in the air.

“Even if we decarbonize our economies, there are still 20 or so gigatons of carbon dioxide that needs to be removed from the atmosphere to keep us anywhere near the Paris Accord goals,” Siegel said.

0654b91e-26b9-496f-88d8-b931a09f399a,"President Joe Biden signed a sweeping climate, energy and health care bill on Aug. 16, 2022, that contains about US$370 billion to foster clean energy development and combat climate change, constituting the largest federal climate investment in history.

Several studies project that its climate and energy provisions could enable the United States to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by around 40% below 2005 levels by 2030. That would be a significant improvement over the current projections of around 27%, and it could put the U.S. within hailing range of its pledge under the Paris Agreement to reduce emissions by at least 50% by 2030.

Notably, one linchpin of the new climate provisions is a set of incentives to substantially expand technologies that capture carbon dioxide and either store it underground or ship it for reuse.

So far, the uptake of carbon capture technologies has been slow. The costs are high, and these technologies can require miles of pipeline and vast amounts of underground storage, both of which can trigger local backlash. A recent study projected that the U.S. would have to construct 65,000 miles of carbon dioxide pipelines to achieve net-zero emissions in 2050, a whopping 13 times the current capacity.

I’m the former founding co-director of the Institute for Carbon Removal Law & Policy at American University. While the new law, known as the Inflation Reduction Act, has many provisions designed to jump-start the carbon removal sector, it’s far from certain that the industry will be able to move quickly.

One-sixth of all emissions cuts

The Inflation Reduction Act includes two primary types of carbon capture.

Carbon capture and storage entails capturing carbon dioxide generated during power generation and industrial processes, such as steel and concrete production, and transporting it for storage or use. The most common use to date has been for enhanced oil recovery – injecting the gas into oil and gas reservoirs to extract more fossil fuels.

It also seeks to drive deployment of direct air capture technologies, which can pull carbon dioxide out of the air.

A Princeton University analysis estimated that pertinent provisions of the legislation “would increase the use of carbon capture 13-fold by 2030 relative to current policy,” with only a modest amount projected to come from carbon dioxide removal. This could translate into about one-sixth to one-fifth of its projected carbon dioxide emissions reductions.

Consistent with most of its other energy and climate provisions, the Inflation Reduction Act seeks to drive widespread deployment of carbon removal technologies through incentives. Most importantly, it substantially amends a provision of the U.S. tax code referred to as 45Q, which is designed to drive corporate investments in carbon capture.

Under its provisions, tax credits for capturing carbon dioxide at industrial facilities and power plants would increase from $50 per ton today to up to $85 per ton if the carbon is stored. If the carbon is used instead for oil drilling, the credit would go from $30 today to $60 per ton.

Credits for capturing carbon from air via direct air capture would also dramatically jump, from $50 to $180 per ton if the carbon dioxide is stored, and from $35 currently to $130 per ton if it is used.

The new law also moves back the deadline for starting construction of carbon capture facilities that qualify from 2026 to 2033, reduce the minimum capture requirements for obtaining credits, and permit direct payments for the full value of credits for the first five years of a project’s operation in lieu of tax credits.

Missing pieces

Currently there are only a dozen carbon capture and storage facilities in the U.S. and a couple of direct air capture facilities removing a small amount of carbon from the air.

There’s a reason the uptake of carbon capture, particularly direct air capture, has been slow. Direct air capture cost estimates vary from $250 to $600 per ton, according to one analysis, while experts have estimated that a price under $100 and closer to $50 could create a market.

Some experts believe that the Inflation Reduction Act sufficiently ratchets up 45Q credits to start driving widespread construction of carbon capture and storage facilities in the power and industrial sectors. Others believe that the direct pay provision is “the fundamental missing piece” for carbon capture and storage because project developers and sponsors can avoid the often onerous and costly process of raising tax equity to qualify to use the credits.

There’s hope that the increase in credit values for direct air capture will help to foster “synthetic economics” for this nascent market, infusing sufficient capital to develop technologies at scales that are profitable.

Pipeline challenges ahead

However, while the Inflation Reduction Act may appear helpful on a theoretical basis, both carbon capture and storage and direct air capture could face some serious headwinds over the course of the next decade and beyond.

One major challenge could be resistance to the construction of pipelines to transport carbon dioxide to storage sites. In recent years, counties and private landowners in Iowa have voiced opposition to such projects, particularly the idea that the state might allow pipeline builders to seize private land for their projects.

Pipeline construction is also a point of contention for environmental groups, especially environmental justice organizations, and could lead to protracted litigation. This stems in part from a carbon dioxide pipeline rupture in Satartia, Mississippi, in 2020, which hospitalized 45 people.

If public opposition delays construction, projects could be pushed past the window for the incentives, leaving developers with expensive projects. While some studies argue that enhanced oil recovery results in a net reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, this may ultimately be a hard political sell for local communities.

The Inflation Reduction Act may ultimately brighten the prospects for carbon removal in America, but this is by no means assured, especially in the optimistic time frame of the next decade.

This article was updated Aug. 16, 2022, with President Biden signing the legislation."
b40c61d9-e669-43af-aea2-91fa15f862c3,"This week President Biden is expected to sign the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which includes an unprecedented $370 billion for climate change mitigation.

Why it matters: Much of the climate money is directed at getting folks like us to switch to more sustainable sources of energy for our homes and transportation.

When it comes to Illinois-level effects, many details still have to be worked out, but a few points are emerging.

Zoom in: Illinois Environmental Council executive director Jen Walling says passage of last year's Climate Equity Job's Act puts the state in a good spot to use the money for projects already in the pipeline.

On cars: Illinois currently offers a $4,000 rebate for the purchase of an electric vehicle (EV), but the IRA could boost that rebate to $7,500 for a new EV or $4,000 for the purchase of a used EV.

Some factors that could affect rebate amounts include a buyer's income and where the car and batteries are made.

On energy production: U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth's office says it expects the state will benefit from the measure's $10 billion in investment tax credits for new solar and wind energy production.

Her office notes that production would happen statewide, considering that southern Illinois' flat topography is ""ideal for large-scale solar and wind installations.""

On energy efficiency: The IRA includes 10 years of tax credits and rebates for homeowners to install efficient windows, doors, heat pumps, insulation, water heaters and solar panels that could reduce their energy bills substantially.

Yes, but: Seth Whitehead of the Illinois Petroleum Resources Board contended recently on Chicago Tonight that many battery components still rely on overseas mining that environmentalists oppose.

He also predicted that renewable home energy will be pricier than some assume because their intermittent nature can require ""backup with either natural gas or batteries.""

The other side: ""We have electrified apartment buildings in Logan Square [with electric heat pumps] without backups, and they got through last winter fine,"" says Anne McKibbin of energy nonprofit Elevate.

""Residents of the building said last winter that they were quite comfortable,"" she says, ""but every home is different.""

The bottom line: Switching to cleaner energy isn't free, but once the IRA's provisions are finalized, the cost of Illinoisans' investments in sustainable energy is likely to drop considerably."

bb2b3a8b-5825-4cd8-bdfb-0d4fb4ee3151,"When the House of Representatives passed landmark climate legislation on Friday, Joe Biden chalked up one of the surprise successes of his presidency. Only last month his ambitious agenda appeared sunk after a conservative Democrat and coal baron, Joe Manchin, refused to back it. His vote is crucial in an evenly divided Senate. However, the climate proposals were largely resurrected in the form of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), co-authored by Mr Manchin, which Congress approved.

The first major US climate law comes not a moment too soon. It is the country’s best and last opportunity to meet its goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and, with it, a world where net zero by mid-century is possible. After Donald Trump, Mr Biden can reclaim the mantle of global climate leadership for the US. But the act reveals the limits of his power.

The Democrats’ initial $3.5tn plan was to expand education, fight poverty, lower healthcare costs and tackle climate change. That was whittled down to a $1.75tn bill that the House passed last year. But it got nowhere in the Senate. Mr Manchin refused to back the social security programmes and his centrist colleague Kyrsten Sinema refused to back the tax rises. What was left was $490bn in climate and healthcare investments.

This deserves a small cheer from progressives. Mr Biden is pursuing a muscular policy of state intervention in the economy. The act for the first time gives the federal government the power to negotiate lower drug prices. Significantly for the climate, it represents a new US industrial policy that subsidises zero-carbon power production via tax credits. It also recognises that the US is falling behind China in green technology – spending $152bn less on renewable investments last year – and focuses on ways to encourage clean-energy manufacturing.

Politics in the US is unfortunately far too influenced by the power of vested interests. The US remains addicted to fossil fuels, which generate 61% of its electricity. Its shale gas industry is looking to replace Russia as the major energy supplier to Europe. The upshot was that fossil fuel lobbyists won concessions in the climate legislation. The compromise means linking renewable development to new oil and gas extraction for which many communities will bear the disproportionate cost.

Nevertheless, for every one tonne of emissions caused by the act’s fossil fuel provisions, the non-partisan Energy Innovation thinktank says 24 tonnes of emissions are avoided by its green provisions. This ought to help energise Mr Biden’s base ahead of the midterm elections. Despite Republican antagonism, climate action enjoys broad support in the US. A Pew Research Center poll suggests that 58% of voters think the federal government is doing too little to “reduce the effects of global climate change, compared with just 18% who say it is doing too much”.

To be a truly transformative president, Mr Biden will need to remake society. What the act demonstrates is that he does not have the votes – yet – in his own party for such a programme. Mr Biden’s climate plans may fall short because he is relying on the carrot of spending rather than the stick of taxes to underpin an energy transition. Yet the wasteful consumption of the wealthy will have to be reduced with progressive taxation to make resources available for socially-useful spending. Ultimately the climate emergency needs a fundamental economic restructuring. Mr Biden’s new environmental law is a good start, but there’s a very long way to go."
4d9bf2fd-f1a3-4980-b9f1-926fb78519ef,"What does that look like? First, we need to start stigmatizing fossil fuel enablers wherever they exist. Seeds of this work have already been planted in some professions—Law Students for Climate Accountability is working to exert pressure within the legal industry on firms that represent fossil fuel clients; Clean Creatives has made a real mark on the PR industry by naming and shaming the agencies and creative professionals that produce fossil fuel propaganda; and the Fossil Free Research movement is taking this same approach to Big Oil’s influence in academic and research institutions. We need to build the infrastructure necessary to support and strengthen these kinds of organizing efforts in every trade and profession that the fossil fuel industry relies on to maintain its power.

Second, we need to start taking climate liability litigation seriously. As the fight against Big Tobacco proved, court battles can play a critical role in eroding a destructive industry’s social license. Nobody—from progressives to conservatives—likes being lied to, and the climate fraud cases that states and municipalities have begun filing have the potential to drive the narrative of Big Oil’s deception in powerful ways (not to mention uncover further examples of greed and treachery through civil discovery). So far there are around two dozen such cases making their way through the courts; we need to turn that number into two hundred, or better yet, two thousand.

Third, we need to invest in the frontline communities that are taking on the fossil fuel industry in real time, as well as the environmental and climate justice networks that support their organizing. These are the people that the drilling and pipeline provisions that Democrats conceded in order to pass the IRA will hurt the most. And their stories could hold the key to broader efforts to undermine public acceptance of the fossil fuel industry. After all, no one understands the ruthlessness and cruelty of oil and gas companies better than the people who’ve watched these corporations destroy their homes and poison their water and engage in all the other barbarities that folks on the frontlines of extraction and production have been subjected to."

This week, President Biden is expected to sign into law the Inflation Reduction Act, the most comprehensive climate legislation ever to pass Congress. The bill will be the largest investment, by a factor of four, into the energy transition in our nation’s history — $369 billion for renewable energy subsidies, energy efficiency tax credits, methane reduction and an array of other clean energy provisions. Its passage in the Senate earlier this month and Friday in the House was met by a chorus of approval from activists, scientists and voters, many of whom have been awaiting for this day for decades.

But the bill has its critics.

Varshini Prakash, executive director of the climate change advocacy group Sunrise Movement, noted: “It’s clear that the IRA is not enough.” Rhiana Gunn-Wright, director of climate policy at the liberal think tank the Roosevelt Institute, shared Prakash’s frustration, tweeting: “I — and so many others — are being asked to co-sign our communities being sacrificed in order to move forward on issues we spend our lives working on.” Even Sen. Bernie Sanders commented that the bill “doesn’t go anywhere near as far as it should” before ultimately voting for it.

The mixed reactions are reflective of a bill that is, from top to bottom, the product of compromise. In return for the votes of their most centrist senators, Democrats sacrificed federal waters to oil and gas drilling, over $180 billion of funding from the original bill and more stringent measures to shutter fossil fuel power plants, many of which are located in minority communities. For much of the political left, these sacrifices were worth the emissions reductions the bill delivers. The policy firm Energy Innovation summed up this bargain, projecting that “for every ton of emissions increase(d) … at least 24 tons of emissions are avoided.”

After decades of gridlock in Congress, the climate movement declined to, as the saying goes, let the perfect be the enemy of the good.

In this sense, the bill is a microcosm for our country’s energy transition, which itself is a question of trade-offs. Clean energy, despite its moniker, isn’t entirely clean. Solar panels depend on environmentally disruptive mines for the copper, aluminum and zinc they are made from. Wind turbines pose a threat to birds. And nuclear power plants contain on-site radioactive waste. Is the destruction of a local habitat an acceptable cost for replacing fossil fuels with carbon-free energy?

Many would say it is.

But some trade-offs are harder to swallow. Is the power from a dam worth displacing a community? Is the swift adoption of renewable energy worth weakening environmental regulations? And with nearly half of the world’s polysilicon (a key component of solar panels) sourced from factories in the genocidal tragedy that is China’s Xinjiang province, is forced labor an acceptable cost for cheap renewable energy?

Strip away the specifics of these scenarios, and you are left with the central question of the energy transition: What is worth sacrificing to protect the climate? It is an intensely personal dilemma, to which every individual brings a unique set of experiences, incentives and values. The fate of the energy transition depends on society’s collective answer to this question.

At least, it should. In reality, the energy transition has hinged on a different question: Who gets to decide what is worth sacrificing?

Of the 50 senators who produced the Inflation Reduction Act, 42 were white and 34 were men. All earned more than quadruple the country’s median income. For better or for worse, it was these 50 individuals — with their own constellations of influences and personal values — who decided what was worth sacrificing for climate action.

To overlook the importance of who holds this power is to ignore the history of our energy system. Across the country, low-income and minority communities suffer elevated rates of asthma and cancer due to power plants, factories and other industrial facilities located in their neighborhoods. These communities were forced to accept the facilities because they were not represented in the rooms where it was decided what was worth sacrificing for the services the facilities would provide. So they were sacrificed.

If the purpose of the energy transition is to redress the harm of the existing energy system, it must confront the underrepresentation that shaped that system. Failing to reckon with this history won’t just be a “slap in the face” to environmental justice community; it will also create a new energy system as lacking in accountability as the old one.

The Inflation Reduction Act is a tremendous victory for a movement in which victories are few and far between. Comprehensive climate legislation was always going to require compromise, and the broad coalition of activists, policymakers and experts whose tireless work made this bill possible should celebrate reorienting the United States toward a more sustainable future. But as they celebrate, they should not dismiss those who don’t share their elation, because the burden of compromise is not shared equally.

The bill highlights the importance of representation in government. Its provisions, compromises and omissions are the product of those who negotiated it, and of those who didn’t. Opportunities to transform the energy system don’t come along often. When they do, they should be met by policymakers who reflect America.

3ebcf845-ab86-43f9-b072-5858ea017139,"The Earth is approximately 1.1℃ warmer than it was at the start of the industrial revolution. That warming has not been uniform, with some regions warming at a far greater pace. One such region is the Arctic.

A new study shows that the Arctic has warmed nearly four times faster than the rest of the world over the past 43 years. This means the Arctic is on average around 3℃ warmer than it was in 1980.

This is alarming, because the Arctic contains sensitive and delicately balanced climate components that, if pushed too hard, will respond with global consequences.

Why is the Arctic warming so much faster?

A large part of the explanation relates to sea ice. This is a thin layer (typically one metre to five metres thick) of sea water that freezes in winter and partially melts in the summer.

The sea ice is covered in a bright layer of snow which reflects around 85% of incoming solar radiation back out to space. The opposite occurs in the open ocean. As the darkest natural surface on the planet, the ocean absorbs 90% of solar radiation.

When covered with sea ice, the Arctic Ocean acts like a large reflective blanket, reducing the absorption of solar radiation. As the sea ice melts, absorption rates increase, resulting in a positive feedback loop where the rapid pace of ocean warming further amplifies sea ice melt, contributing to even faster ocean warming.

This feedback loop is largely responsible for what is known as Arctic amplification, and is the explanation for why the Arctic is warming so much more than the rest of the planet.

Is Arctic amplification underestimated?

Numerical climate models have been used to quantify the magnitude of Arctic amplification. They typically estimate the amplification ratio to be about 2.5, meaning the Arctic is warming 2.5 times faster than the global average. Based on the observational record of surface temperatures over the last 43 years, the new study estimates the Arctic amplification rate to be about four.

Rarely do the climate models obtain values as high that. This suggests the models may not fully capture the complete feedback loops responsible for Arctic amplification and may, as a consequence, underestimate future Arctic warming and the potential consequences that accompany that.

How concerned should we be?

Besides sea ice, the Arctic contains other climate components that are extremely sensitive to warming. If pushed too hard, they will also have global consequences.

One of those elements is permafrost, a (now not so) permanently frozen layer of the Earth’s surface. As temperatures rise across the Arctic, the active layer, the topmost layer of soil that thaws each summer, deepens. This, in turn, increases biological activity in the active layer resulting in the release of carbon into the atmosphere.

Arctic permafrost contains enough carbon to raise global mean temperatures by more than 3℃. Should permafrost thawing accelerate, there is the potential for a runaway positive feedback process, often referred to as the permafrost carbon time bomb. The release of previously stored carbon dioxide and methane will contribute to further Arctic warming, subsequently accelerating future permafrost thaw.

A second Arctic component vulnerable to temperature rise is the Greenland ice sheet. As the largest ice mass in the northern hemisphere, it contains enough frozen ice to raise global sea levels by 7.4 metres if melted completely.

When the amount of melting at the surface of an ice cap exceeds the rate of winter snow accumulation, it will lose mass faster than it gains any. When this threshold is exceeded, its surface lowers. This will quicken the pace of melting, because temperatures are higher at lower elevations.

This feedback loop is often called the small ice cap instability. Prior research puts the required temperature rise around Greenland for this threshold to be be passed at around 4.5℃ above pre-industrial levels. Given the exceptional pace of Arctic warming, passing this critical threshold is rapidly becoming likely.

Although there are some regional differences in the magnitude of Arctic amplification, the observed pace of Arctic warming is far higher than the models implied. This brings us perilously close to key climate thresholds that if passed will have global consequences. As anyone who works on these problems knows, what happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic."

Scandinavian research shows Arctic warming nearly four times as fast as entire globe

New Finnish-Norwegian research published Thursday shows Arctic global warming is happening nearly four times as fast as the entire globe. This is known as Arctic amplification. ""We show that during 1979-2021, the Arctic has warmed nearly four times faster than the globe, and provide evidence that climate models struggle to simulate this four-fold Arctic amplification ratio,"" the researchers wrote. The study scientists said their research cautions that referring to Arctic warming as being twice as fast as the global warming rate is ""a clear underestimation of the situation during the last 43 years since the start of satellite observations."" ""Our results indicate that the recent four-fold Arctic warming ratio is either an extremely unlikely event, or the climate models systematically tend to underestimate the amplification,"" the study said.

FBI searched Trump’s home to look for nuclear weapons documents and other items, sources say

Classified documents relating to nuclear weapons were among the items FBI agents sought in a search of former president Donald Trump’s Florida residence on Monday, according to people familiar with the investigation. Experts in classified information said the unusual search underscores deep concern among government officials about the types of information they thought could be located at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club and potentially in danger of falling into the wrong hands. […] Material about nuclear weapons is especially sensitive and usually restricted to a small number of government officials, experts said. Publicizing details about U.S. weapons could provide an intelligence road map to adversaries seeking to build ways of countering those systems. And other countries might view exposing their nuclear secrets as a threat, experts said. […] One former Justice Department official, who in the past oversaw investigations of leaks of classified information, said the type of top-secret information described by the people familiar with the probe would probably cause authorities to try to move as quickly as possible to recover sensitive documents that could cause grave harm to U.S. security.

[…] Attorney General Merrick B. Garland on Thursday confirmed that he personally signed off on a search warrant that was executed on Monday. He did not address a subpoena, but said that “where possible, it is standard practice to seek less intrusive means,” indicating that other measures were tried before a search took place. […] Some senior Republicans have been warned by allies of Mr. Trump not to continue to be aggressive in criticizing the Justice Department and the F.B.I. over the matter because it is possible that more damaging information related to the search will become public.

Justice Department asks to release Mar-a-Lago warrant, ‘absent objection’ from Trump

The Justice Department has asked a federal court in Florida to unseal the warrant that led to the search of Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home on Monday and make public a list of the items removed from the property — “absent objection” by the former president. The unusual move by the department, announced Thursday by Attorney General Merrick Garland in a rare public statement on an ongoing criminal probe, reflected the extraordinary nature of the search of a former president’s house. It also put the burden on Trump to choose whether to make potentially incriminating details of the case available to the public. Garland said the FBI had gone to lengths to keep the execution of its search warrant out of public view, noting it was Trump — not the Justice Department — who alerted the media to the mid-morning search of his Palm Beach estate.

Daughter of a former Republican congresswoman pleads not guilty to threatening Georgia judge in election case

The daughter of a former Republican congresswoman has pleaded not guilty to felony charges alleging that she threatened a Georgia judge after he dismissed a lawsuit claiming fraud in the 2020 presidential election. Erin Northup, a 43-year-old from Louisville, Kentucky, left a voicemail message with the judge’s office saying “There will be hangings. We will be coming after your family,” according to an arrest warrant. Northup entered a not guilty plea last week in Henry County Superior Court. The expletive-filled call to the office of Superior Court Judge Brian Amero’s office came on the night he ruled against Donald Trump supporters who wanted to unseal absentee ballots so they could look for fakes. […] Northup, the daughter of former U.S. Rep. Anne Northup, faces two counts of terroristic threats on allegations she threatened to kill Amero and a court clerk.

Texas elections officials targeted amid 2020 fraud claims report threats, intimidation to Congress

Misinformation about elections has led to violent threats against election workers in Texas and other states — including one who was told “we should end your bloodline” — according to a new report released by a House panel Thursday. The House Committee on Oversight and Reform heard from one county election official in Texas that he received death threats after being singled out by out-of-state candidates who claimed the 2020 election was stolen. Those threats quickly escalated and eventually included his family and staff. […] The findings are the latest evidence of how … Donald Trump’s unfounded claims that the 2020 election was rigged against him have taken root as they have been echoed by his supporters, including Texas Republicans who passed new voting restrictions last year.

How Republicans rigged Texas’s federal courts against Biden

One of the biggest impediments to President Joe Biden’s ability to govern is a small crew of Republican-appointed federal trial judges, all of whom sit in Texas. […] The fact that all these cases — and this is just a sample of the many policy-setting lawsuits being shunted to a handful of the most conservative judges in Texas — are winding up before a few GOP-appointed judges is not a coincidence. It is a deliberate strategy, made possible by procedural rules that effectively allow litigants to select which judge will hear their lawsuits, and by all appearances, intentionally pursued by the Texas attorney general’s office. […] So the Biden administration’s policies are routinely blocked, not because an impartial judge gives those policies a fair hearing and determines them to be illegal, but because Republican litigants can ensure that lawsuits seeking to undermine President Biden are heard by some of the most partisan judges in the country. […] Texas’s district courts divide their work in ways that make it easy for plaintiffs challenging a federal policy to choose which judge will hear their case.

Alex Jones Isn’t Going To Pay $45.2 Million in Damages

[…] The repeated legal misconduct by Jones and his attorney during the trial sapped some of the intrigue; the judge in Austin ruled last year that Jones should lose by default for repeatedly withholding evidence that court rules require to be shared between the litigants. The trial on damages ended last week, with a jury finding Jones should pay $4.1 million in compensatory damages to two parents, followed by a separate award of punitive damages (called “exemplary” damages in Texas) in the amount of $45.2 million. Maybe this sounds low to you, based on what a pile of human garbage Jones is. But the truth is actually worse. Jones will never pay that $45.2 million. Because of tort reform caps, those punitive damages are going to get pared back to a meager $750,000. To understand how that will play out, you need to understand the laws that govern these sorts of proceedings in Texas.

The Snowballing US Rental Crisis Is Sparing Nowhere and No One

[…] Rental costs in the US are soaring at the fastest pace in more than three decades, surpassing a median of $2,000 a month for the first time ever and pushing rents above pre-pandemic levels in most major cities. Increases are particularly steep in metropolitan areas that saw large influxes of new residents during the pandemic, but the rental market is sparing almost nowhere and no one. While the affordability crisis in the US is not new, it has snowballed over the past year as people returned to big cities and some areas short on housing supply saw a boom of new residents. Demand for rentals has soared, with many would-be homebuyers backing out of the market after mortgage rates jumped this year as a result of the Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest-rate hikes. […] Meanwhile, US landlords, including property investors snapping up a growing share of homes in metro areas, are gaining the upper hand.

What the Inflation Reduction Act does and doesn't do about rising prices

[…] The White House says the roughly $700 billion package will address inflation in two key ways: by lowering energy and health care costs for families and by helping to bring down the deficit… There are three main ways the bill targets rising prices, according to [Shai Akabas, the director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center]. First, it plans to reduce the federal deficit, which is the difference between how much the U.S. government spends and how much it makes in taxes and revenue. When there's less money floating in the economy, there tends to be less demand and fewer price hikes, Akabas said… Second, it will promote the production of certain goods, mainly in renewable energy. Having more supply than demand could help lower some costs over time, he added. Third and more directly, one provision of the bill will help limit the price growth of certain prescription drugs by allowing Medicare to negotiate their cost with pharmaceutical companies. Still, some of the biggest drivers of inflation, including food and energy costs, are not immediately addressed. […] ""It's not likely to have a major effect on inflation in the next few months,"" Akabas said.

Oregon Democrats say landmark bill would help communities adapt to climate change

[…] On Wednesday, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael S. Regan along with Oregon Gov. Kate Brown, Oregon Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, discussed how funding from proposed [Inflation Reduction Act] would significantly address the many inequities Black, Indigenous and communities of color face because of climate change. […] The Inflation Reduction Act includes $60 billion for clean and renewable energy infrastructure like solar panels, wind turbines and tax credits for purchasing electric vehicles. The bill pledges $27 billion for a greenhouse gas reduction fund, also known as a ‘green bank,’ to help fund more clean energy and sustainable projects, like Mudbone Grown. Shantae Johnson, co-owner of Mudbone Grown, said the creation of a green bank would make it easier for farmers like her to apply for public money rather than applying for private funds. She said green banks would also help smaller farmers get started and maintain their business instead of being priced out.

Armed man who was at Capitol on Jan. 6 is fatally shot after firing into an FBI field office in Cincinnati

The man who fired a nail gun into an FBI field office in Cincinnati on Thursday before he was killed by officers was at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, officials said. Two officials familiar with the matter identified the suspect as Ricky Walter Shiffer. […] Shiffer was seen at the Capitol on Jan. 6, although it's unclear whether he breached the building, said three people aiding law enforcement who saw him in photos. Shiffer frequently posted about going to the Capitol on social media. In the days after the FBI searched Mar-a-Lago, Trump's compound in Palm Beach, Florida, he appeared to post multiple times on Trump's social media platform, Truth Social. In one comment, he appeared to call on people to prepare for ""combat."" In another, his apparent account said users should kill FBI agents ""on sight.""

With California expected to lose 10% of its water within 20 years, Newsom calls for urgent action

With California enduring historic drought amplified by global warming, Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday released a new plan to adapt to the state’s hotter, drier future by capturing and storing more water, recycling more wastewater and desalinating seawater and salty groundwater. The governor’s new water-supply strategy, detailed in a 16-page document, lays out a series of actions aimed at preparing the state for an estimated 10% decrease in California’s water supply by 2040 because of higher temperatures and decreased runoff. The plan focuses on accelerating infrastructure projects, boosting conservation and upgrading the state’s water system to match the increasing pace of climate change, securing enough water for an estimated 8.4 million households. “The hots are getting a lot hotter. The dries are getting a lot drier,” Newsom said. “We have to adapt to that new reality and we have to change our approach.”

Rainwater Unsafe To Drink Due To Chemicals: Study

Rainwater everywhere on the planet is unsafe to drink due to levels of toxic chemicals known as PFAS that exceed the latest guidelines, according to a new study by Stockholm University scientists. Commonly known as 'forever chemicals' because they disintegrate extremely slowly, PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) were initially found in packaging, shampoo or makeup but have spread to our entire environment, including water and air. ""There is nowhere on Earth where the rain would be safe to drink, according to the measurements that we have taken,"" Ian Cousins, a professor at the university and the lead author of the study published in Environmental Science and Technology, told AFP.

Night of terror in Mexico raises alarm bells in US over narco violence

“Seek secure shelter.” That was the recommendation for staff of the United States consulate in Guadalajara after the Mexican city descended into violence, with local authorities reporting multiple road blockades, burning vehicles and shootouts. The security alert was issued late on Tuesday in response to the night of terror that followed the attempted capture of a regional leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG). The drug cartel fought back against the Mexican army in the states of Jalisco and Guanajuato, blocking roads and setting fires to cars. Five were arrested, and one alleged gang member died in the clashes, according to figures provided by the governor of Jalisco, Enrique Alfaro, on Wednesday. Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said the narco violence was in response to an army operation in the middle of a conclave of two criminal gangs. Security forces were deployed for several hours until they were able to reestablish control. By noon, the US Consulate had withdrawn the security alert, although it said it “continued to closely monitor the situation.” […] The White House has issued travel warnings for 30 of the 32 states of Mexico.

[…] “War is definitely not the time for vanity and loud statements. The fewer details you divulge about our defence plans, the better it will be for the implementation of those defence plans,” Zelenskiy said in an evening address. “If you want to generate loud headlines, that’s one thing - it’s frankly irresponsible. If you want victory for Ukraine, that is another thing, and you should be aware of your responsibility for every word you say about our state’s plans for defence or counter attacks.”

Imperiled by Russian invaders, private citizens are stepping forward to do what Ukraine’s government cannot.

[…] The Russian strategy toward Ukraine is designed to demoralize and demotivate. It works. Except when it doesn’t. For the languor of Odesa is the backdrop, not the story: Not everyone there is afflicted with apathy, anxiety, or the fear of losing. On the contrary, even in this strange moment, when time doesn’t seem worth measuring, some people are intensely busy. Across the city, students, accountants, hairdressers, and every other conceivable profession have joined what can only be described as an unprecedented social movement. They call themselves volonteri, and their organizations, their crowdfunding campaigns, and their activism help explain why the Ukrainian army has fought so hard and so well, why a decade-long Russian attempt to co-opt the Ukrainian state mostly failed, even (or maybe especially) in Russian-speaking Odesa. In a paralyzed landscape, in a stalled economy, in a city where no one can plan anything, the volonteri are creating the future. They aren’t afraid of loss, siege, or occupation, because they think they are going to win.

Occupied Ukrainian plant becomes epicenter of Russia’s nuclear blackmail

Anticipating a Ukrainian counter-offensive in the country’s south, Russia is turning the six-reactor Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in occupied Enerhodar into a ticking time bomb. Repeated Russian shelling from within the plant’s territory, causing one of the reactors to shut down, has put the entire complex’s safety at stake. The city of Enerhodar, occupied by Russia since March 4, lies on the bank of the Dnipro River at the edge of Russian-controlled parts of Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Russia has been constantly shelling Ukrainian positions across the river from Enerhodar and accused Ukraine of firing back. Ukrainian authorities have had none of it, saying it's Russian forces causing fires at the site by using indiscriminate fire.

Finland is building the world's first permanent disposal site for nuclear waste

It's inconceivable to people in most parts of the world that anyone would actively want to live near a nuclear waste site. But in the western Finnish town of Eurajoki, there's no NIMBYism (""Not In My Backyard"") as the municipality actually campaigned against other cities to have the disposal site located there, next to the existing Olkiluoto nuclear power plant. Authorities determined that this area had best mix of a bedrock of public support and actual bedrock to become spent nuclear fuel's final resting place, almost half a kilometer underground. Mayor Vesa Lakaniemi explains that being home to three reactors and the repository — called Onkalo, which means ""little cave"" in Finnish — provides long-term security for his residents. Real-estate taxes from the nuclear site bring in about 20 million euros per year, almost half the municipality's annual revenue.

Low Rhine deepens Germany's energy crisis

A hot, dry July made worse by climate change has raised the risk that the German economy could run aground as sinking Rhine waters make shipping along the river harder. The prospect of severe, longer-term limits to traffic spells a new headache for the industries lined up on the river's banks and threatens to further strain Germany's efforts to wean itself off Russian energy imports as coal counts among key cargo moved on the waterway. […] As Berlin turns to mothballed coal power capacity to plug the gap after Russia curtailed its energy deliveries, the Rhine has taken on added significance as a key artery for coal transport.

The impact of drought in England: water restrictions, fire risks and farming hardship

England is likely to be declared officially in drought on Friday, a move that will allow water companies to impose tough restrictions on water use as temperatures remain high across swathes of the UK. […] With temperatures likely to reach 36C in some places over the weekend, England is experiencing its driest nine-month period since 1976. South-east England received less than 10% of its usual amount of rainfall in July, making it the driest July since 1935. Rainfall has been at about 74% of its long-term average since last November. […] Climate experts said the drought had been predicted for some time. Mike Rivington, a senior scientist at the James Hutton Institute in Scotland, said: “The scale of heatwaves and droughts we’re currently experiencing has been projected by climate research for many years now. What we are seeing is a clear signal of what the future is going to be like.”

Heatwaves threaten marine life as Mediterranean reaches record temperature

France has seen searing temperatures in successive heatwaves over the past few weeks, but it’s not only on land that temperatures are insufferably high. The Mediterranean Sea’s surface temperature reached a record high 30.7°C in late July, and marine heatwaves are becoming increasingly common because of climate change – with dramatic consequences for biodiversity. As Europe battles wildfires and record drought on land, rising sea temperatures pose another kind of threat. On July 24, the temperature in the Mediterranean reached a peak of 30.7°C off the coast of Alistro in eastern Corsica, according to the Keraunos meteorological observatory. The next day, in the bay of Villefrance-sur-Mer – an idyllic beach town a few miles from Nice – a researcher at the local oceanographic laboratory recorded a temperature of 29.2°C. “It’s unprecedented,” said the researcher, Jean-Pierre Gattuso. The Mediterraean’s temperature is usually between 21° and 24°C at this time of year.

Climate change and overfishing threaten once ‘endless’ Antarctic krill

[…] Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) are not “limitless,” as they were once described in the 1960s; they’re a finite resource under an increasing amount of pressure due to overfishing, pollution, and climate change impacts like the loss of sea ice and ocean acidification. While krill are nowhere close to being threatened with extinction, the 2022 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change indicated that there’s a high likelihood that climate-induced stressors would present considerable risks for the global supply of krill. “Warming that is occurring along the Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia Sea has caused the krill stocks in those areas to shrink and the center of that population has moved southwards,” Kim Bernard, a marine ecologist at Oregon State University, wrote to Mongabay via email while stationed in the Antarctic Peninsula. “This tells us already that krill numbers aren’t endless.” Concerns are amassing around one place in particular: a krill hotspot and nursery at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula known as “Area 48,” which harbors about 60 million metric tons of krill. Not only has this area become a key foraging ground for many species that rely on krill, but it also attracts about a dozen industrial fishing vessels each year. The amount of krill they catch has been steadily increasing over the years

In Kenya, pending election results keep the nation in suspense

It has been two days since voting ended in Kenya’s closely contested presidential election but for many citizens of the country, it feels like much longer. “I am very anxious,” said Jacqueline Adhiambo, a 31-year-old resident of Eldoret, in western Kenya. “When I wake up in the middle of the night, I have to fight to desire to check my phone or turn on the television.” Adhiambo, a voter registered in Eldoret, a stronghold of its most famous son, Deputy President and presidential candidate William Ruto, left her town for the capital, Nairobi, on the eve of the August 9 election. She was worried that violence could break out if Ruto lost to his closest competitor, Raila Odinga. That line of thinking was critical to a 64 percent turnout in Tuesday’s election – a drop from almost 80 percent in 2017.

Dog lost for two months found in Perry County's Tom Moore caves

On Saturday, while exploring the Tom Moore cave system in Perry County, Missouri, a group of cavers came across a lost dog alone in the dark. Gerry Keene was with a group of experienced cavers, five of them children. The plan was to go from the Berome Moore entrance and move through a mile of caves and emerge at the Tom Moore entrance. However, about 20 minutes after entering the cave, the group found the dog. He said the dog was just lying there in the main passage and appeared to have given up. ""She's in the pitch black, and the poor baby wouldn't even move for us at first,"" Keene said. ""But once she had been in the light for a bit, she started to get energized.""

f9036a75-a236-4ca8-8075-4a5202eda926,"The Arctic is warming four times faster than the rest of the world, and in some areas as much as seven times. That’s according to new research by a group of Norwegian scientists. This effect, dubbed “Arctic amplification”, is well documented, though the new study finds the region is warming even faster than previously thought.

One of the reasons is the loss of ice cover over the sea in the Arctic. Exposed ocean water absorbs more radiation from the sun than white ice. So, as ice cover diminishes then the rate of warming increases. This is what climate scientists call a positive feedback loop, sometimes referred to as a tipping point.

Changes in the Arctic can have massive and outsized impacts on other parts of the world. Greenland’s melting ice sheet could raise sea levels, for instance, while ocean circulation currents can be changed which in turn affect weather patterns elsewhere.

An obvious question then is whether there is any way we can halt the warming specifically in the Arctic? Fortunately, there are potential avenues for us to pursue, even if they are all unproven in practice.

Fill the skies with tiny particles

The first idea would be to release material such as sulphur dioxide into the stratosphere which would cause small particles to form that would reflect more of the sun’s energy back into space. With less solar radiation entering the lower parts of the atmosphere, the ground below would cool down. This process is known as stratospheric aerosol injection.

The concept has been studied for some time and is similar to what happens when a large volcano erupts. For instance the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines released about 20 million tonnes of sulphur dioxide and ash particles, and cooled the planet by about 0.5℃ for a year (for context, that temporarily erased about half of the global warming since pre-industrial times).

Cooling the Earth with this method would involve getting sulphur dioxide up into the stratosphere at low latitudes. The material would then get distributed around the world by winds and gradually migrate towards the pole in the hemisphere into which it was released, thereby providing a reflective shield. If the release was applied to low latitudes in both hemispheres, then it would cool the whole Earth.

However, if we wanted to just cool the Arctic then the particles could be released closer to the region. The stratosphere also begins much lower down (about 9km at the North Pole compared to 17km at the equator) so planes wouldn’t have to fly so high.

Brighten the clouds

The second idea involves “brightening” clouds over the ocean in order to, again, reflect more of the sun’s energy back into space. This is derived from the observation that under certain conditions, particles ejected from the funnels of ships cause clouds to form over the ocean.

Over land, there is plenty of dust and other tiny particles for clouds to first form around, but over the ocean there is much less. Those clouds that do form over the ocean tend to do so around salt crystals left behind after droplets of “sea spray” evaporate in the air.

However, the type of clouds which form depends on the size of the salt crystals. If the crystals are sufficiently small, then clouds are formed of lots of small droplets. This is important because clouds composed of smaller droplets appear whiter than those with larger droplets, and therefore reflect more sunlight, even if the clouds have the same total amount of water. Therefore, it may be possible to whiten clouds by creating more sea spray, and more tiny droplets. This could be achieved near the Arctic through the deployment of boats with pumps and nozzles.

So, there are two ideas which could help preserve the Arctic and buy us time while we work incredibly hard to sort out the root cause of the problem – namely that the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is already too high, and we are currently making things even worse.

However, both of these two ideas for halting the warming in the Arctic need a lot more focused research and development. This work needs to involve international groups but especially those who are most affected by climate change and least able to adapt. This includes indigenous groups not just in the Arctic but those in other parts of the world whose countries even may not exist in the coming decades as sea levels continue to rise.

886aa913-b09f-48ac-9143-813fd0c1ba18,"The Arctic is heating up nearly four times faster than the whole planet, study finds

Enlarge this image toggle caption Sean Gallup/Getty Images Sean Gallup/Getty Images

The Arctic is heating up nearly four times faster than the Earth as a whole, according to new research. The findings are a reminder that the people, plants and animals in polar regions are experiencing rapid, and disastrous, climate change.

Scientists previously estimated that the Arctic is heating up about twice as fast as the globe overall. The new study finds that is a significant underestimate of recent warming. In the last 43 years, the region has warmed 3.8 times faster than the planet as a whole, the authors find.

The study focuses on the period between 1979, when reliable satellite measurements of global temperatures began, and 2021.

""The Arctic is more sensitive to global warming than previously thought,"" says Mika Rantanen of the Finnish Meteorological Institute, who is one of the authors of the study published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment.

There have been hints in recent years that the Arctic is heating up even more quickly than computer models predicted. Heat waves in the far North have driven wildfires and jaw-dropping ice melt in the circumpolar region that includes Alaska, Arctic Canada, Greenland, Scandinavia and Siberia.

""This will probably be a bit of a surprise, but also kind of extra motivation perhaps,"" says Richard Davy, a climate scientist at Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center in Norway, who was not involved in the new study. ""Things are moving faster than we could have expected from the model projections.""

There are many reasons why the Arctic is heating up more quickly than other parts of the Earth. Changes in the amount of air pollution coming from Europe and natural multi-decade climate variations likely play a role. But human-caused global warming is the underlying reason that the Arctic, and the planet as a whole, are heating up.

Loss of sea ice is one of the clearest drivers of Arctic warming. The Arctic Circle is mostly ocean, which used to be frozen for most or all of the year. But permanent sea ice is steadily shrinking, and seasonal ice is melting earlier in the year and re-forming later.

That means more open water. But while ice is bright and reflects heat from the sun, water is darker and absorbs it. That heat helps melt more ice, which means more water to trap more heat – the loop feeds on itself, accelerating warming in the Arctic.

NASA YouTube

""That's why the temperature trends are the highest [in] those areas where the sea ice has declined most,"" explains Rantanen. There are hotspots in the Bering Sea over Northern Europe and Siberia, which are heating up about seven times faster than the global average, the study estimates.

Rapid Arctic warming affects people living far from the Arctic circle. For example, there is evidence that weather patterns are shifting across the U.S. and Europe as sea ice melts, and many marine species migrate between the tropics and the Arctic each year. ""What happens in the Arctic doesn't just stay in the Arctic,"" says Davy.

The new research also finds that the advanced computer models that scientists use to understand how the global climate is changing now, and will change in the future, struggle to capture the relative speed of Arctic warming. That suggests that future models may need to be adjusted to better capture the realities of global warming in polar regions, although this study did not tease apart what exactly is missing from current models.

""The paper's finding that climate models tend to underestimate the warming ratio [between the Arctic and the Earth as a whole] is really interesting,"" says Kyle Armour, a climate scientist at the University of Washington who was not involved in the new study.

Previous studies have found that computer models actually do a good job estimating how much the Arctic has heated up, but that they tend to overestimate how much hotter the whole planet is, Armour explains. That means the models' comparison between Arctic warming and overall warming ends up being incorrect.

""We have more work to do to figure out the source of this model bias,"" says Armour. And that work is increasingly important, because world leaders use climate models to understand what the future holds and how to avoid even more catastrophic warming."
d91dd356-5a93-4ad5-97b2-d4bc14bd32ec,"The Arctic is warming much faster than previously thought, according to a new study, which highlighted the challenges ahead for limiting climate change and keeping global temperatures in check.

While previous scientific estimates concluded that the Arctic was warming twice as fast as the rest of the globe, the new study undertaken by researchers with the Finnish Meteorological Institute and published Thursday in the journal Communications Earth & Environment claims that the Arctic increase over the last 43 has been 3.8 times faster than the global average.

“In recent decades, the warming in the Arctic has been much faster than in the rest of the world, a phenomenon known as Arctic amplification. Numerous studies report that the Arctic is warming either twice, more than twice, or even three times as fast as the globe on average,” the study states. “Here we show, by using several observational datasets which cover the Arctic region, that during the last 43 years the Arctic has been warming nearly four times faster than the globe, which is a higher ratio than generally reported in literature.”

Mika Rantanen, one of the study’s authors, noted that the rate of warming was not uniform throughout the Arctic Circle, and that portions of the Barents Sea, which borders Russia, have been warming at up to seven times the global average.

Regionally, the warming has been even stronger. Areas in the Barents Sea near Novaya Zemlya have warmed up to seven times the global average, as recently reported in @SciReports by @Ketil_Isaksen et al: https://t.co/kv062RO3hV

Calling prior scientific assessments of the rate of warming in the Arctic “a clear underestimation of the situation,” the new study comes at a time when Greenland’s ice sheet continues to melt with unprecedented speed and wildfires have burned more than 3 million acres in Alaska this summer.

As global temperatures continue to climb thanks to the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere caused by the burning of fossil fuels, the threat to the Arctic and Antarctic polar ice caps worsens. That melting is poised to continue to cause sea levels to rise dramatically in the coming decades, and could also trigger what scientists refer to as “feedback loops,” which will further speed the rate of global warming.

Two of those loops that pertain to the Arctic include the “albedo effect,” which refers to white sea ice reflecting the sun’s radiation back into space. The loss of that ice means that the Earth’s darker surface and waters absorb that radiation, further warming the planet. In fact, the albedo effect is, in part, behind the increased rate of warming measured in the study.

A second feedback loop occurs with the melting of the Arctic permafrost, which then releases previously frozen carbon and methane stores that further increase temperatures while also potentially unleashing dormant viruses and bacteria.

Climate scientists have long warned that unless dramatic action is taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, global warming will continue, polar ice caps will melt, oceans and temperatures will rise significantly and life as we know it will be put at risk.

On Friday, the House of Representatives is poised to pass the first major climate change legislation in the United States to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Democrats already passed the bill along party lines in the 50-50 Senate, and the measure is expected to face uniform GOP opposition in the House as well."

Climate change and extreme weather events are fueling hunger, conflict and inequality at an unprecedented rate in the countries least equipped to deal with the impact, according to a new report released on Friday by Oxfam, the international aid agency.

The charity looked at the 10 countries that were the subject of the most United Nations appeals for extreme weather-related crises since 2000: Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Djibouti, Guatemala, Haiti, Kenya, Madagascar, Niger, Somalia and Zimbabwe. The report found that these countries have seen the number of people suffering acute hunger — when food is scarce — more than double in the last six years to 48 million, with nearly 18 million on the brink of starvation, when people succumb to that scarcity of food.

Pointing to recent crises such as the droughts across the Horn of Africa and the devastating floods in Pakistan, the report highlights how weather extremes are becoming more common and more severe – increasing by fivefold in the last 50 years.

The countries least responsible for climate change are suffering the most

Yet despite the destruction wrought by climate change, collectively those 10 climate hot spot nations are responsible for just 0.1% of global carbon emissions. The G20 nations — which represent 19 of the world's largest economies, plus the European Union — contribute around 80%.

""These countries which are most impacted are the ones who contribute least to climate change and have the least resources,"" said report author Emily Farr. She thinks that countries that pollute the most have a moral imperative to support their climate-vulnerable neighbors.

Earlier this year, as part of the research for the ""Hunger in a Heating World"" report, Farr, who works on food security issues for Oxfam, visited Somalia, where one of the world's worst humanitarian disasters is unfolding.

""The impact from what is now five consecutive seasons of drought is visible,"" Farr said. ""I talked to families living on rice and nothing else."" She says the impoverished families acknowledged that she must be tired of hearing them talk about the help they need, and that they in turn are tired of asking. The families told her that they need investment to help them adapt for the long term.

The charity offers pointed criticism of the oil and gas industry. It cites a not-yet-published analysis of World Bank data claiming that companies have amassed profits of $2.8 billion a day for the last 50 years, yet the report notes that insufficient funds have been allocated to help those affected by climate change.

""Less than 18 days of those profits would cover the entire $48.82 billion U.N. humanitarian appeal for 2022,"" the report states.

It's not just climate change that's bringing a hunger crisis

Oxfam points out that while climate change is not the only cause of the impoverishment of people in the listed countries, sudden weather extremes multiply the effects of pre-existing conflict, inequality and economic shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic. And for millions of people, time is already running out.

""While aid has saved lives, it is facing cuts and in Somalia we expect to see famine before the end of the year unless we see a massive scaling up of funding,"" Farr observed. Oxfam uses an international classification system to determine when famine is declared, which includes when at least 20% of households in an area face an extreme lack of food. ""There is still a small window to prevent famine in Somali, but it is incredibly urgent because other countries are facing really worrying hunger conditions,"" she said. The report also highlights the irony that the global food system is partly to blame for the soaring hunger with its industrial model and reliance on chemicals contributing up to a third of total greenhouse gas emissions.

""The food system is heavily oriented toward the corporate model of production. Meanwhile, smallholders who are minimal contributors to climate change and use sustainable techniques don't get the support they need."" Farr said.

Gernot Laganda, director of Climate and Disaster Risk Reduction at the U.N. World Food Program, says the report outlines how more frequent and severe climate crises overload the already strained humanitarian aid system.

""When you are bogged down in repeated cycles of crisis response, you don't have time and finances to work on vulnerability reduction on the long-term basis,"" Laganda said. ""The diversification of our food and energy systems is the number one risk management strategy that we need to employ.""

Ahead of U.N. General Assembly meetings this week, and the COP 27 climate change conference in Egypt in November, Oxfam is calling for polluting nations to adopt a suite of measures alongside emissions reductions. They're calling for emergency funds for people facing imminent famine, both debt cancellation and compensation for impacted countries and increased investment in local food production.

Whether Oxfam's advocacy will be heeded remains to be seen. Last year after the COP 26 in Glasgow, the charity condemned rich countries for blocking a proposal to compensate climate-hit developing countries for damage already wrought.

The report also calls for the provision of safe and legal routes for people impelled to move due to climate change. In Somalia over a million have been internally displaced just this year. In Latin America, weather conditions have decimated harvests of coffee and maize, forcing members of vulnerable communities to migrate to the United States.

Wealthy industrialized countries may be less exposed to extreme weather but are far from immune, as indicated by recent record drought in Europe and scorching temperatures across the United States.

Laganda warns that if global temperatures do not subside, then the world will reach a tipping point where weather extremes could increasingly become the norm: ""Climate impacts hit the most vulnerable first, but they don't have boundaries. It can happen to any economy in the world.""

The UN food chief said Thursday the war in Ukraine is worsening an ""unprecedented"" global emergency, with up to 345 million people in 82 countries ""marching towards starvation.""

Driving the news: Surging food, fuel and fertilizer costs related to the war have driven some 70 million people closer to starvation, UN World Food Program Director David Beasley told the United Nations Security Council.

That's on top of the ""perfect storm"" of increased conflict, the COVID-19 pandemic's economic impacts and climate change that was already threatening countries before Russia's military invaded Ukraine in February, he noted.

Threat level: Some 50 million people living in 45 countries are now ""knocking on famine's door,"" according to Beasley.

Martin Griffiths, UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, described the situation in Yemen, South Sudan, Ethiopia and northeast Nigeria in particular as bleak, as about 43 million people face high levels of food insecurity in those areas.

Máximo Torero, UN chief economist of the Food and Agriculture Organization, told the Security Council there were also alarming levels of food insecurity in Afghanistan and Somalia.

Of note: Beasley said the Ukraine war was driving up inflation and worsening the humanitarian crisis in Yemen as the Middle East country was almost totally reliant on food imports.

Meanwhile, Beasley said food supplies were at risk of crisis despite a UN-brokered July agreement between Ukrainian and Russian officials to export vital grain from Ukraine following a sustained ports blockade by Russia's military that worsened global food crisis, particularly in African countries.

The bottom line: ""What was a wave of hunger is now a tsunami of hunger,"" Beasley said."

The number of people experiencing extreme hunger has more than doubled in some of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, the charity group Oxfam International said in a new report. Some 48 million people are now suffering from acute hunger, the group said, up from 21 million in 2016. Nearly 18 million of those people — in countries such as Afghanistan, Haiti, Somalia and Zimbabwe — are on the brink of starvation, their lives already disrupted by war, displacement, economic insecurity and the coronavirus pandemic.

Conflict remains the primary driver of hunger, but “the onslaught of climate disasters is now outpacing poor people’s ability to cope, pushing them deeper into severe hunger,” Gabriela Bucher, executive director of Oxfam International, said in a statement.

The report found a strong correlation between extreme weather and rising hunger in 10 climate hot spots, which are Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Djibouti, Guatemala, Haiti, Kenya, Madagascar, Niger, Somalia and Zimbabwe. The countries were identified as hot spots because they had the highest number of United Nations humanitarian appeals for weather-related crises since 2000.

While it is difficult to measure the exact direct impact of climate change on hunger, the report said, as extreme weather “becomes more fierce and more frequent,” it is devastating the lives of millions of people, destroying homes and crops.

The majority of the countries listed are in Africa, where the worst drought in nearly half a century has ravaged communities and caused food shortages, worsened by the war in Ukraine.

Four of the 10 countries — Kenya, Madagascar, Somalia and Zimbabwe — have consistently suffered from food insecurity, “primarily due to weather-related disasters,” according to the World Food Program’s Global Report for Food Crises.

Oxfam International says Somalia is facing its worst drought on record — and that famine is “expected to unfold” in at least two districts. One million people have been forced to flee their homes as a result, the report said.

“Climate change is no longer a ticking bomb, it is exploding before our eyes,” Bucher said.

The report notes that countries “least responsible” for the climate crisis are suffering the most from its impact. Together, the most vulnerable nations account for just 0.13 percent of global carbon emissions but “sit in the bottom third of countries least ready for climate change,” the report says.

In contrast, industrialized nations, including members of the Group of 20, are responsible for nearly 80 percent of global emissions.

“We cannot fix the climate crisis without fixing the systemic inequalities in our food and energy systems,” Bucher said. “... Rich and most polluting nations have a moral responsibility to compensate low-income countries most impacted by the climate crisis. This is an ethical obligation, not charity.”

It's the world's top exporter of sunflower oil, third-largest exporter of barley, fourth-largest exporter of corn, and fifth-largest exporter of wheat, per the World Economic Forum. All signs pointed to serious trouble when Russia invaded resource-rich Ukraine at the end of February this year, yet none of us may have been fully prepared for the devastation that the invasion, which kicked off shortages as well as skyrocketing food prices would cause. The war in Ukraine has affected the food supply.

The chief of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP), David Beasley, now warns that as many as 345 million people are struggling with food insecurity today, and 70 million are ""knocking on famine's door,"" per AP News. As a result, Beasley said instead of facing what he called a ""wave of hunger,"" the world was now facing ""a tsunami.""

And it's not like we weren't warned. In a report the WFP ominously calls Hunger Hotspots from May of this year, the aid agency already identified several vulnerable regions which included Ethiopia, Nigeria, South Sudan, and Yemen, along with Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, and Somalia. These areas named were seen as particularly problematic not just because they were experiencing conflict, but because their agricultural systems were also experiencing the stresses triggered by climate change. This caused extreme weather conditions including frequent droughts in some places and horrific flooding and hurricanes in others.

The Dire Warnings Could Be An Understatement, UN Aid Officials Say

In its report before The United Nations Security Council, the World Food Program highlighted especially vulnerable areas where food insecurity was especially acute due to conflict, and climate change; these included Yemen, South Sudan, and Nigeria, per UN News. But even before this latest report, Beasley says he already sounded the alarm that the world was facing famine and starvation ""of biblical proportions"" as far back as April of 2020, and it was only with intervention that a large-scale human catastrophe had been averted, AP News reports.

Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs chief Martin Griffiths said the situation today is so unstable that even the World Food Programme's warnings can now be considered an understatement, according to UN News. ""Food security assessments could not be conducted in these areas, but we fear that some people may already be in the catastrophe level and risk death,"" Griffiths said. And the situation is such that even Ukraine's recent shipments of grain aren't enough.

Unfortunately, there are no easy solutions to the hunger wave now lapping at the borders of these regions, especially since as Griffiths points out, as it is the vulnerable regions already receive ""well below half of the required funding,"" per AP News. All humanitarian aid officials can do now is to ask for an end to the conflicts in the area and to ask for more money to fund their aid operations.

The UN food chief warned Thursday that the world is facing ""a global emergency of unprecedented magnitude,"" with up to 345 million people marching toward starvation -- and 70 million pushed closer to starvation by the war in Ukraine.

David Beasley, executive director of the UN World Food Program, told the UN Security Council that the 345 million people facing acute food insecurity in the 82 countries where the agency operates is 2 1/2 times the number of acutely food insecure people before the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020.

He said it is incredibly troubling that 50 million of those people in 45 countries are suffering from very acute malnutrition and are ""knocking on famine's door.""

""What was a wave of hunger is now a tsunami of hunger,"" he said, pointing to rising conflict, the pandemic's economic ripple effects, climate change, rising fuel prices and the war in Ukraine.

Since Russia invaded its neighbour on Feb. 24, Beasley said, soaring food, fuel and fertilizer costs have driven 70 million people closer to starvation.

Despite the agreement in July allowing Ukrainian grain to be shipped from three Black Sea ports that had been blockaded by Russia and continuing efforts to get Russian fertilizer back to global markets, ""there is a real and dangerous risk of multiple famines this year,"" he said. ""And in 2023, the current food price crisis could develop into a food availability crisis if we don't act.""

The Security Council was focusing on conflict-induced food insecurity and the risk of famine in Ethiopia, northeastern Nigeria, South Sudan and Yemen. But Beasley and UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths also warned about the food crisis in Somalia, which they both recently visited, and Griffiths also put Afghanistan high on the list.

""Famine will happen in Somalia,"" Griffiths said, and ""be sure it won't be the only place either.""

He cited recent assessments that identified ""hundreds of thousands of people facing catastrophic levels of hunger,"" meaning they are at the worst ""famine"" level.

Beasley recalled his warning to the council in April 2020 ""that we were then facing famine, starvation of biblical proportions."" He said then the world ""stepped up with funding and tremendous response, and we averted catastrophe.""

""We are on the edge once again, even worse, and we must do all that we can -- all hands on deck with every fibre of our bodies,"" he said. ""The hungry people of the world are counting on us, and ... we must not let them down.""

Griffiths said the widespread and increasing food insecurity is a result of the direct and indirect impact of conflict and violence that kills and injures civilians, forces families to flee the land they depend on for income and food, and leads to economic decline and rising prices for food that they can't afford.

After more than seven years of war In Yemen, he said, ""some 19 million people -- six out of 10 -- are acutely food insecure, an estimated 160,000 people are facing catastrophe, and 538,000 children are severely malnourished.""

Beasley said the Ukraine war is stoking inflation in Yemen, which is 90 per cent reliant on food imports. The World Food Program hopes to provide aid to about 18 million people, but its costs have risen 30 per cent this year to $2.6 billion. As a result, it has been forced to cut back, so Yemenis this month are getting only two-thirds of their previous rations, he said.

Beasley said South Sudan faces ""its highest rate of acute hunger since its independence in 2011"" from Sudan. He said 7.7 million people, over 60 per cent of the population, are ""facing critical or worse levels of food insecurity."" Without a political solution to escalating violence and substantial spending on aid programs, ""many people in South Sudan will die,"" he warned.

In northern Ethiopia's Tigray, Afar and Amhara regions, more than 13 million people need life-saving food, Griffiths said. He pointed to a survey in Tigray in June that found 89 per cent of people food insecure, ""more than half of them severely so."" Beasley said a truce in March enabled WFP and its partners to reach almost 5 million people in the Tigray area, but resumed fighting in recent weeks ""threatens to push many hungry, exhausted families over the edge.""

In northeast Nigeria, the UN projects that 4.1 million people are facing high levels of food insecurity, including 588,000 who faced emergency levels between June and August, Griffiths said. He said almost half of those people couldn't be reached because of insecurity, and the UN fears ""some people may already be at the level of catastrophe and already dying.""

Griffiths urged the Security Council to ""leave no stone unturned"" in trying to end these conflicts, and to step up financing for humanitarian operations, saying UN appeals in those four countries are all ""well below half of the required funding."""
3f4cf575-fed7-4a71-9beb-d3195d64e213,"Forests from the Arctic to the Amazon are transforming at a “shocking” rate due to the climate crisis, with trees advancing into previously barren tundra in the north while dying off from escalating heat farther south, scientists have found.

Global heating, along with changes in soils, wind and available nutrients, is rapidly changing the composition of forests, making them far less resilient and prone to diseases, according to a series of studies that have analyzed the health of trees in north and South America.

Many areas of forest are now becoming more susceptible to ferocious wildfires, causing the release of further greenhouse gases from these vast carbon stores that heat the planet even more. “It’s like humans have lit a match and we are now seeing the result of that,” said Roman Dial, a biologist at Alaska Pacific University.

Dial and his colleagues have discovered that a patch of white spruce trees in north-west Alaska have “hopped” north into an area of the Arctic tundra that hasn’t had such trees in millennia. The scientists’ new research paper, published in Nature, estimates the spruce are advancing north at a rate of around 4km a decade, aided by warming temperatures and changes to snow and wind patterns influenced by the shrinkage of sea ice in the region.

“It was shocking to see trees there. No one knew about them but they were young and growing fast,” said Dial, who first spotted the shadows of the trees on satellite imagery and then took a single-engine plane journey, followed by a five-day hike, to find and study the advancing forest.

“The trees basically hopped over the mountains into the tundra. Going by climate models, this wasn’t supposed to happen for a hundred years or more. And yet it’s happening now.”

The Arctic is heating up several times faster than the global average and the emergence of dark conifers on previously pristine white tundra threatens to absorb, rather than reflect, more sunlight, causing further heating. The trees may also disturb the migration of various local species. “These trees are moving very quickly,” said Dial.

Farther south, separate research has found a transformation is under way at the boundary between the boreal and temperate forests, with species of spruce and fir increasingly unable to cope with the hotter conditions. Scientists estimate that even small amounts of further heating, caused by human activity, could cause up to a 50% die-off of traditional boreal forest trees in certain places, with many other trees becoming stunted in their growth.

“Boreal species do very poorly even with modest warming. They grow more slowly and have greater mortality,” said Peter Reich, a researcher at the University of Minnesota who co-authored the research. “Intuitively, I thought they would do slightly worse with 1.5C of warming, but they do much worse, which is worrisome.”

Reich and his colleagues spent five years raising nine different tree species from seedlings under different conditions in northern Minnesota, subjecting them to different amounts of heat and water. The boreal species were found to have suffered when soils dried out due to the heat while other more temperate species, such as oak and maple, were able to cope better and may be able to slowly shift into the boreal zone as the world warms further.

“Given how fast climate change is, we could get a 50 to 150 year period where spruce and fir over thousands of miles, including from Siberia to Scandinavia, don’t regenerate, so you’ll have this strange new system of invasive shrubs that won’t provide us with the economic and ecological services we are used to,” Reich said.

The impact of the climate crisis is also being felt in the heart of the Amazon, a further study has underlined. Scientists have raised concerns that the huge rainforest ecosystem is in danger of tipping into a new, altered state, eventually becoming a savannah, and the new research found that a lack of phosphorus in the Amazon’s soils could have “major implications” for its resilience to global heating."
18def1a7-8c1c-46ef-83eb-5b7e53835650,"From 2007 to 2017, land-based ecosystems like the vast boreal forests of Canada and the Amazon rainforest removed roughly a third of anthropogenic carbon emissions from the atmosphere. According to a slate of new scientific research published this week in Nature, however, the threats that climate change poses to these terrestrial carbon sinks are greater than previously understood.

A new study from a research team at the University of Michigan found that even a relatively small temperature increase of 1.6 degrees Celsius associated with climate change can have drastic effects on the dominant tree species in North American boreal forests, including reduced growth and increased mortality.

“Our results spell problems for the health and diversity of future regional forests,” University of Michigan forest ecologist Peter Reich, who led the study, told the University of Michigan news office.

This vast and nearly entirely intact boreal forest biome, stretching across the Canadian landmass and some of the northern U.S., below tundra and above more temperate forest, consists primarily of coniferous spruce, pine, and fir species. The research team found that modest warming increased juvenile mortality in all nine tree species common in boreal forests, and that it also severely reduced growth in northern conifer species such as balsam fir, white spruce, and white pine.

While the study also found that increased warming boosted the growth of some broadleaf hardwood species like certain oaks and maples, which are more common in the temperate south, these trees are probably too sparse to take the place of disappearing conifers. The ecosystem is likely to enter an entirely “new state,” according to the study.

“That new state is, at best, likely to be a more impoverished version of our current forest,” Reich told the university news office. “At worst, it could include high levels of invasive woody shrubs, which are already common at the temperate-boreal border and are moving north quickly.”

The five-year experiment used infrared lamps and soil-heating cables to heat thousands of spruce, pine, and fir seedlings at two University of Michigan forest sites in northeastern Minnesota. Seedlings were heated around the clock in the open air, from early spring to late fall, at two different potential projections of near-term temperature increases.

Reich, who is the director of the Institute for Global Change Biology at the University of Michigan’s School for Environment and Sustainability, elaborated that boreal forests may be reaching a tipping point at which even modest global warming creates a feedback loop that not only reduces the ability of boreal forests to support healthy plant, microbial, and animal biodiversity, but also their ability to remove and store carbon.

Additional research published in Nature this week found that climate change is driving spruce trees into swaths of Arctic tundra that haven’t hosted trees in thousands of years, and yet another study added to worries about the resilience of the Amazon rainforest to climate change."

Young white spruce are now growing in the tundra, where climate scientists did not expect them to be for another hundred years or more, according to a new study conducted in Alaska.

The paper, published this month in Nature, found the tree species, which normally grows in the middle of Alaska, is expanding north into areas where cold temperature s previously limited vegetation to low shrubs and lichen.

Its authors, researchers from Alaska Pacific University, University of Alaska Anchorage, Amherst College, and Northern Arizona University, estimate the spruce are gaining around 4km per decade, faster than any documented high-latitude population of conifers.

The findings underscore new research that shows scientists underestimated the speed at which the Arctic is melting. It is warming up four times faster than the rest of the world, transforming ecosystems, upending migratory patterns of animals, releasing and redistributing carbon—and creating the environmental conditions for conifers to grow.

All of this will have global implications.

M igrating forests exacerbate the effects of climate change

More trees in the tundra mean less sunlight reflected off the ground and absorbed by vegetation instead, leading to further melting of Arctic ice.

Boreal conifers can jump from location to location, and traveled over mountains into the tundra, according to Roman Dial, the lead author of the study.

It’s possible tree seedlings have taken root in other remote, inaccessible areas of the tundra that scientists have not yet discovered, the authors said. Young trees are hard to detect even with satellites. The scientists first discovered the spruce trees in 2019 during a field study.

Because little is understood about how trees are adapting to climate change, discoveries like these are invaluable, helping scientists learn how to protect and reproduce species at ri sk now or in the future."
99751221-8b4c-4a1c-90c5-9c2c54d08ac5,"Site description and experimental design

The experiment was located at two University of Minnesota field stations: the Cloquet Forestry Center (CFC), Cloquet, MN (46° 40′ 46′′ N, 92° 31′ 12′′ W) and, ~150 km further north, the Hubachek Wilderness Research Center (HWRC), Ely, MN (47° 56′ 46′′ N, 91° 45′ 29′′ W). At both sites, plots were in relatively open (recently cleared) overstory conditions. Forest clearing occurred in the winter of 2006–2007 at the Cloquet site and the winter of 2007–2008 at the Ely site. Both sites have well-drained, coarse-textured upland soils. The overall experimental design was a 2 (site) × 2 (rainfall) × 3 (warming) factorial, with three replicates of each, for a total of 36 circular 3-m-diameter plots. Treatments included three levels of simultaneous plant and soil warming (ambient, +1.6 °C, +3.1 °C), all of which included infrared lamp heaters and soil heating cables (dummy lamps and cables in the ambient plots). These realized warming levels were slightly different from those in experiments in prior years11,23. Warming was implemented from early spring to late fall each year in open air (that is, without chambers) through a feedback control that acts concurrently and independently at the plot scale to maintain a fixed temperature differential from ambient conditions above and below ground. On average, we achieved 24-hour-a-day warming of +1.6 °C and +3.1 °C (Extended Data Table 1).

The reduced rainfall treatment has been achieved since 2012 through rainout shelters built on randomly selected plots across warming treatments at both sites. Rainout shelters were used to reduce both total rainfall and the number of rain events (Extended Data Table 1) from 1 June to 30 September by ~40% and as a result reduced these by ~30% from 1 May to 30 September (for details on rain shelter design and implementation, see ref. 35). To minimize shading of tree seedlings, rainout shelters were typically and briefly deployed only during overcast conditions or at night.

To place our temperature and rain treatments within a broader temporal context, we compared the mean growing season (1 May–30 September) data at one of our sites (CFC) to century-scale data (1912–2011) available there (no such record is available for our other site). The ambient mean growing season temperature of 15.4 °C in 2012–2016 at CFC was near the long-term average (0.2 °C cooler than the 1912–2011 mean, ~45th percentile). The +1.6 °C and +3.1 °C treatments resulted in growing season temperatures similar to and ~1 °C warmer than the five warmest summers in the century, respectively. The average ambient growing season cumulative rainfall at CFC in 2012–2016 (564 mm) was higher than the 1912–2011 average of 471 mm. However, rainfall of 197 mm on 29 June 2012 was the second highest rainfall day on record since 1912, with five times the rain of the 99th-percentile wettest day during the prior 100 years. As the vast majority of the 197 mm that fell that day ran off, including this extreme event in our total may have misrepresented how wet soils were at the CFC site during our study. We therefore removed 80% of this single-day event from the rainfall records reported in our study. When averaged over the 5 years, this adjustment had a very modest impact. At CFC, averaged ambient growing season precipitation from 2012–2016 corresponded to the 80th- and 75th-percentile wettest growing season (compared with 1912–2011) without and with this rainfall adjustment, respectively, and the growing season rainfall in the rainfall reduction treatment corresponded to the 25th- and 20th-percentile wettest growing season without and with the rainfall adjustment, respectively. Thus, our ambient and reduced rainfall treatments represent historically typical wet and dry growing season conditions.

Plant and soil temperature and soil moisture (depth of 0–20 cm) were measured continuously and recorded hourly in every plot throughout the study. Plant surface temperature was measured with surface tissue-imitating acrylic blocks with embedded thermocouple sensors35. VWC from 0 to 20 cm in depth was measured in each plot using a 30-cm Campbell Scientific CS-616 probe inserted at 45°. VWC (cm3 H 2 O per cm3 soil) was monitored hourly in all plots and corrected for soil textural and temperature differences11.

Seedlings of the nine native tree species were planted into existing herb, shrub and fern vegetation in each plot. Following forest clearing from harvest, wildfire or windthrow, forest understories often, but not always, regenerate quickly, and the density of woody stems (shrub and tree species) can range from near zero to as high as 24 individuals per m2 (refs. 36,37,38). We planted seedlings in 2012 at a density and mean height of 12.5 individuals per m2 (at roughly 25- to 30-cm spacing) and 26 cm, respectively, in randomly assigned neighbourhoods and replanted sufficiently (see below) to reach a similar total density in 2013. The density and mean height of surviving individuals were 10.1 individuals per m2 and 98 cm, respectively, in late 2016. Cover in our plots was roughly two-thirds herbaceous and shrub vegetation (graminoids, forbs, shrubs and ferns) and one-third planted tree seedlings. Six years after clearing, our plots averaged a leaf area index (LAI) of ~2.25 across the growing season, which is similar to the values of 2.4 and 2.7 observed 4 to 6 years after clearing in two other studies24,25. We found no evidence that density-related or competition-related microclimatic conditions had a key role in regulating observed treatment responses. Several species showed strong within-cohort mortality in the year of planting for the 2012 cohort, even in ambient treatments (B. papyrifera, P. banksiana and P. strobus; Extended Data Fig. 1), while much less was seen for the 2013 cohort in 2013. Given that overall density was similar in 2012 and 2013 and that the 2013 cohort was a year younger (and thus smaller on average), if total density were driving mortality we would expect greater mortality in 2013 for the 2013 cohort than in 2012 for the 2012 cohort; however, that was not the case for these or any other species. Additionally, all species (except perhaps A. rubrum) showed less mortality with each successive year, in all treatments, yet LAI (our best integrated measure of total competition) grew slightly larger with time and was higher in 2015 and 2016 when mortality was low than in 2012 and 2013 when mortality was higher. Collectively, these results suggest that higher mortality in earlier years was due to the expected greater per capita mortality rate of younger, smaller individuals and not due to greater density-related competition in those earlier years.

The planted juveniles included five broadleaf and four needleleaf species, all of which are present in the temperate–southern boreal region. Methods of defining the indices of species range limits and local ecotypic distributions are provided in Extended Data Table 2. Information about the regional relative abundance of our study species was obtained for two time periods in the past in northeastern Minnesota27, for 2019 from the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) Ecological Classification Section 212 in northeastern Minnesota28 and for the 1990s from Canadian boreal shield forest in central and eastern Canada29. Local ecotypes of all native seedlings were obtained from the state nurseries run by MNDNR. MNDNR acquires seeds from commercial collectors. Ecotypes used in this study represent a random collection of populations from the northeast part of the state. A total of 3,163 seedlings were planted in 2012. Because of high mortality in some species (which generally occurred to some extent in all treatments in those species), we planted a second cohort (of 1,448 seedlings) in 2013 to replace those that had died, plus additional individuals to provide a balanced design to enable statistical analyses of each cohort individually. The 2013 cohort ranged from 9% to 44% of the total seedlings per species, with the 2012 and 2013 cohorts making up 69% and 31% of the total numbers, respectively. Because of species differences in survival in year 1, the 2013 cohort ranged widely in numbers among species (Extended Data Table 3). Across the 2 years, numbers planted per species ranged from a high of 625 in P. banksiana to a low of 387 in A. saccharum (Extended Data Table 2). Given the very low A. saccharum mortality in 2012, the 2013 cohort was very small and thus is not shown in Extended Data figures at the species scale. All other species had at least 15 replications of the 2013 cohort in each of the six treatment combinations.

Survival, growth and photosynthesis measures and statistical analyses

Survival, tree diameter at 5 cm and height were measured each fall for all individuals. In recognition of potential cohort effects, proportional hazards analyses of survival data using all data were run including terms for each cohort. The Wald R2 test was used to assess the significance of independent terms and interactions on survival. We also included initial seedling height at planting as a covariate. We ran the same model for both cohorts together but only using data from common years (2013–2016). Additionally, we ran proportional hazards analyses for each cohort separately (2012–2016 for the 2012 cohort and 2013–2016 for the 2013 cohort). Results were similar in all cases; hence, for simplicity, we emphasize results using all data across 2012–2016. We show the separate analyses by cohort in Extended Data Table 4 and the associated survival data in Extended Data Fig. 1.

Total stem biomass in each year was estimated for all surveyed individuals using a regression relation (from 790 trees harvested in 2011) that describes biomass as a function of tree diameter and height (R2 = 0.95, P < 0.0001). In this paper, we report stem biomass growth responses, as these integrate growth in diameter and height. We used mixed models for growth analyses; using year as a continuous variable, we were able to include both cohorts in these repeated-measures mixed models. We also included initial seedling height at planting as a covariate. We used the F ratio to test the significance of all independent variables and their interactions on growth. The mixed model used first-order autoregressive covariance structure to account for repeated measures (year).

Results with five-way interactions (proportional hazards) or six-way interactions (growth) were generally similar using temperature as a continuous or nominal variable. According to the Akaike information criterion (AIC), the models with temperature as a nominal variable were slightly better, but these were worse according to the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) that exerts a larger penalty for the greater complexity. Given that by BIC treating temperature as linear was a better model and that the results were also visually relatively linear for survival in all species and for growth in most species, we show these models in the paper. Using BIC values as a guide, we also selected both growth and survival models with at most three-way interactions, as higher-order interactions explained very modestly more of the variation and were considered poorer by BIC. For the three response variables, effect sizes were assessed at the species level for the two warming treatments at both rainfall treatments, expressed as the percent change relative to the same metric in ambient temperature, ambient rainfall plots, that is, ((value in treatment/value in ambient) × 100) – 100. All analyses were performed using JMP Pro (16.1.0, SAS Institute).

Net photosynthesis

In situ measures of light-saturated net photosynthesis and leaf stomatal conductance were made for all species using six Li-Cor 6400 portable photosynthesis systems23. Simultaneous leaf temperature measurements were made for most species using the internal fine wire thermocouple located in the bottom of the 2 × 3 cm2 Li-Cor leaf chamber (6400-02B LED) and directly touching the leaf during measurement. However, for two conifers (A. balsamea and P. glauca), we used a conifer chamber LED light source (6400-22L) and leaf temperature was calculated on the basis of energy balance (for details, see the Li-Cor 6400XT manual). Leaf temperature measured in the cuvette and canopy surface temperature (measured independently with plant canopy surface-imitating temperature sensors, as described above) were strongly correlated. Cuvette leaf temperature was usually ~2 °C higher than canopy temperature. This is largely because the cuvette and the enclosed leaf warmed up from being in the sun; additionally, leaves selected for measurement of photosynthesis were upper-canopy leaves in sunlit positions, whereas part of the plant canopy surface sensed by the thermometers was often in partial shade. Measurements were made throughout the growing seasons (June to September) of 2012–2016. A total of ~5,000 measurements were made across species, treatments, sites, dates and years. All measurements were made on different leaves, the vast majority of which were from different individuals, which was especially the case within years. Measurements were made in the morning or early afternoon (that is, typically between 08:30–15:00 solar time). Fully expanded, healthy upper-canopy leaves were sampled from individuals planted in a combination of ambient and +3.1 °C treatments at both sites, in both rainfall treatments. Light was maintained in the leaf chamber at saturating levels using the LED light source. Air flow was set at 500 µmol s–1, and CO 2 reference concentrations were set at 400 µmol mol–1. The estimated V Cmax and the relative stomatal limitation to photosynthesis were calculated as in ref. 11.

Extended Data Fig. 8 was assembled using accumulated precipitation and averaged temperature data available in the Climatic Research Unit Time Series (CRU TS) dataset39 (version 4.05). This dataset contains monthly averages for all land areas except Antarctica from 1901 to 2020 with a resolution of 0.5 degrees. We used the subset corresponding to North America, limited to the region from 98.0° to 88.0° W. For every pixel of our subset, we calculated the accumulated precipitation and the average temperature from May to September of each year before computing the averages for different intervals of 30 years staggered by one decade (1941–1970, 1951–1980, 1961–1990, 1971–2000, 1981–2010 and 1991–2020). To reduce noise, 5% of the most external data were discarded and the contours contain only the central 95% of the pixels that overlap with the range of the species represented in each panel (extracted from ref. 40).

Boreal forests cover much of Russia, Alaska and Canada and are a major carbon sink, but they are menaced by more frequent wildfires and invasive species outbreaks linked to climate change.

To assess how higher temperatures and less rainfall may impact the tree species most commonly found in the forests, a team of researchers based in the United States and Australia conducted a unique five-year experiment."
060a2a60-d7da-4912-abd7-8fa5ba7a2761,"ANN ARBOR, MI – The boreal forests of North America could be destroyed by even modest climate change, new research shows.

A recently published scientific study led by a University of Michigan ecologist found an overall temperature increase of less than 3 degrees (1.6 Celsius) will cause major problems for tree species that now thrive in the most northern forests of the continent, particularly when combined with reduced rainfall.

Boreal forests of North America are among the planet’s largest remaining nearly intact woodland ecosystems, where vast amounts of terrestrial carbon remain sequestered in trees and plants. Climate changes could harm both biodiversity and the ability for these forests to produce timber, researchers warn.

These Northwoods are primarily found in Canada and Alaska, but also in parts of northern Maine, northeastern Minnesota, and across Michigan’s northern forestlands. Boreal forests are made up of mostly conifer trees such as spruce, fir, and pine, which can survive latitudes with freezing conditions during at least half the calendar year; they are bordered by tundra to the north and temperate forests to the south.

A five-year experiment involved the use of infrared lamps and soil heating cables to study expected impacts of climate change on thousands of seedlings from nine tree species found within the boreal range. Scientists warmed young trees at two University of Minnesota forest sites around the clock from early spring through late autumn in open-air conditions, not inside greenhouses or growth chambers.

The researchers studied two climate outcomes: an increase of about 2.9 degrees (1.6 C) and 5.6 degrees (3.1 C) above ambient air temperatures. They also used tarps above half the test plots before storms to catch rainwater and mimic shifts in precipitation from a changing climate.

The experiment involved more than 4,500 seedlings of nine native tree species, including five broadleaf and four conifer species: balsam fir, bur oak, jack pine, paper birch, red maple, red oak, sugar maple, white pine, and white spruce. They were planted into existing herb, shrub, and fern vegetation at the study sites in Minnesota.

Temperature and rainfall conditions replicated in the study are not expected to be seen for at least another 40, 50, or 60 years, researchers said.

The study found even an increase of 2.9 degrees (1.6 C) caused many of the tree seedlings to grow less robustly and die more frequently, especially among balsam fir, white spruce, and white pine. Lacking rainfall amplified those negative effects.

These results spell problems for the health and diversity of future regional forests, said Peter Reich, U-M forest ecologist and director of the Institute for Global Change Biology at the university’s School for Environment and Sustainability. He was the lead author for the study published Aug. 10, 2022, in the journal Nature.

Reich said the southern reaches of the boreal forest – like those in Michigan, Minnesota, and Maine – may reach a tipping point from even modest temperature increases, which could diminish the makeup of the forests. Those changes could reduce the capacity of forests to produce timber, maintain biodiversity, dampen flooding, and sequester carbon.

“Forests in Michigan that might not be growing as well aren’t going to be scrubbing as much carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and holding it in their wood or in the soil,” Reich said. “And the same failure to thrive is going to be happening for similar forests in Wisconsin and Minnesota and in Ontario and Quebec and in Siberia, and all over the world. And that’s going to be causing the climate to change faster.”

While the changing climate is expected to cause negative impacts for conifer trees in boreal forests, the study showed the opposite may happen among hardwood tree species more common in temperate forests to the south.

Modest warming can be expected to enhance the growth of several types of broadleaf hardwoods, including some oaks and maples. But those hardwood species are too scarce in the southern boreal forest to fill the void expected to be left by vanishing conifer trees, researchers say.

Reich said what likely will remain should global warming increase temperatures as little as three degrees is an altered landscape – neither boreal nor temperate forest – with abundant invasive woody shrubs already common at the temperate-boreal border.

“What’s most likely to happen is that the most vulnerable trees will start to do poorly. Individual trees will slow down their growth, they won’t be very healthy, they might be susceptible to drought or insects, and they won’t regenerate, meaning that if their seeds shed, the seedings that come from those tree species … will suffer higher mortality and won’t grow very well,” he said.

According to a slate of new scientific research published this week in Nature, however, the threats that climate change poses to these terrestrial carbon sinks are greater than previously understood.

A new study from a research team at the University of Michigan found that even a relatively small temperature increase of 1.6 degrees Celsius associated with climate change can have drastic effects on the dominant tree species in North American boreal forests, including reduced growth and increased mortality.

""Our results spell problems for the health and diversity of future regional forests,"" University of Michigan forest ecologist Peter Reich, who led the study, told the University of Michigan news office.

This vast and nearly entirely intact boreal forest biome, stretching across the Canadian landmass and some of the northern U.S., below tundra and above more temperate forest, consists primarily of coniferous spruce, pine, and fir species. The research team found that modest warming increased juvenile mortality in all nine tree species common in boreal forests, and that it also severely reduced growth in northern conifer species such as balsam fir, white spruce, and white pine.

While the study also found that increased warming boosted the growth of some broadleaf hardwood species like certain oaks and maples, which are more common in the temperate south, these trees are probably too sparse to take the place of disappearing conifers. The ecosystem is likely to enter an entirely ""new state,"" according to the study.

""That new state is, at best, likely to be a more impoverished version of our current forest,"" Reich told the university news office. ""At worst, it could include high levels of invasive woody shrubs, which are already common at the temperate-boreal border and are moving north quickly.""

The five-year experiment used infrared lamps and soil-heating cables to heat thousands of spruce, pine, and fir seedlings at two University of Michigan forest sites in northeastern Minnesota. Seedlings were heated around the clock in the open air, from early spring to late fall, at two different potential projections of near-term temperature increases.

Reich, who is the director of the Institute for Global Change Biology at the University of Michigan's School for Environment and Sustainability, elaborated that boreal forests may be reaching a tipping point at which even modest global warming creates a feedback loop that not only reduces the ability of boreal forests to support healthy plant, microbial, and animal biodiversity, but also their ability to remove and store carbon.

Additional research published in Nature this week found that climate change is driving spruce trees into swaths of Arctic tundra that haven't hosted trees in thousands of years, and yet another study added to worries about the resilience of the Amazon rainforest to climate change."
38bd93ea-2ca5-424c-97a6-52dfc7511785,"Earth’s forests have a major role in absorbing human-produced carbon dioxide and thus make a key contribution towards mitigating global warming. Writing in Nature, Dow et al.1 report the results of their investigation into whether the extended length of the growing season due to global warming affects the amount of carbon sequestered when wood grows.

Read the paper: Warm springs alter timing but not total growth of temperate deciduous trees

Every year, forests remove from the atmosphere the equivalent of about one-quarter of the carbon produced by human activities2. This happens when trees, to support their growth towards the Sun’s light, take up CO 2 into their leaves and transform this carbon into sugar, which constitutes the carbon source of the tree. This sugar circulates in the tree, feeds its carbon reserves and fuels the production of woody structures, such as the stem, branches and roots. These constitute the main carbon sinks, where the carbon can remain trapped for hundreds of years. Quantifying the contribution of forests to the global carbon budget is essential to assess the consequences of climate change in the years ahead. At present, global warming is already advancing the time at which leaves emerge in spring3. This results in an earlier start to CO 2 absorption, which might therefore promote tree-stem growth, wood production and carbon sequestration4.

Dow and colleagues carried out a retrospective study to assess the growth of temperate deciduous forests in eastern North America. Their findings show that earlier tree growth in spring does not necessarily translate into notable increased annual carbon sequestration in terms of wood production (Fig. 1). Dow et al. used remote-sensing data to confirm that leaf emergence in spring had been occurring earlier in the year at two iconic deciduous forests (the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute forest near Front Royal, Virginia, and the Harvard Forest in Petersham, Massachusetts). Then, the authors explored tree-stem radial growth (growth of the stem circumference), assessing the incremental change at weekly time intervals, using data from nearly 500 trees, collected over 6 years (Harvard Forest) or 10 years (Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute forest). The results show, as expected, a corresponding trend of an earlier start of stem growth in warm springs.

Figure 1 | How early spring due to climate change affects tree growth. To understand the effects of climate change on the carbon sequestered annually by trees, Dow et al.1 investigated the consequences of an early start to the growing season in deciduous forests. Leaf emergence is followed by carbon uptake by the process of photosynthesis. Over time, carbon can be captured for long-term sequestration if it contributes to radial growth (growth in the stem circumference) and wood formation. The areas under the curves for annual growth represent growth in terms of: the amount of carbon captured by leaves; annual radial growth (tree-ring width); and increase in woody biomass. The authors report that the early arrival of spring, shifting the margins of the growing season (lighter curves), had little impact on the final annual tree-ring width or the amount of woody biomass produced, whereas high temperatures in summer had a negative effect on radial growth (dotted curve). Other studies11,14 (also plotted here as dotted curves) indicate that high temperatures and related drought can suppress carbon capture and woody-biomass production — carbon capture is less affected than is radial growth, which, in turn, is less affected than is growth in biomass.

However, the authors found that, despite spring’s earlier onset, the length of the peak growing season, the maximum growth rates and the total annual tree growth did not change significantly. To confirm that the rise in spring temperatures had little effect on the final annual tree-ring widths, an indicator of growth, the authors quantified climate–growth relationships of more than 200 centennial-long tree-ring chronologies from more than 100 sites across the temperate deciduous forest belt in eastern North America. This analysis showed that, compared with the effect of spring temperatures, these forest sites were more sensitive to summer temperatures — which slowed woody growth — during the peak growing season. Dow and colleagues’ unexpected results challenge current ideas about carbon allocation in trees.

It is commonly assumed that, when deciduous trees bear leaves, they steadily allocate over time a large part of the sugar generated through the process of photosynthesis to the growth of annual tree rings. Thus, if leaves appear earlier, it could be assumed that the rings would grow correspondingly wider during the year. However, such an oversimplified concept of tree growth does not fully encompass processes that occur during the course of the growing season.

Low phosphorus levels limit carbon capture by Amazonian forests

As the authors report, the relationship between temperature and ring width is dominated by the negative impact of the warmer months (May to July). This not only shows that the dynamics of wood formation, and the amount of wood produced, changes during the growing season, but also indicates that warmer temperatures can have different effects depending on the time of the year (for example, stimulating wood growth in spring, but hindering it in summer). As shown by studies monitoring wood formation5, the ring-widening process follows a bell-shaped curve that peaks around the summer solstice. Therefore, an early start of growth will make only a minor contribution to the final annual ring width.

Two elements further complicate efforts to associate the timing of leaf development (leaf phenology) with the dynamics of tree-ring formation. First, the ability to transform the carbon captured by leaves into woody structures depends on a process called xylogenesis, which occurs in a tissue called the vascular cambium and generates wood cells for water transport, mechanical support and storage of reserves, including water and carbon. In other words, carbon acquired through photosynthesis can be converted into woody biomass only to the extent that xylogenesis allows6. Moreover, there is a high degree of autonomy between the carbon sinks and sources, thanks to the role of carbon reserves that accumulate in wood tissues. In addition, coarse roots and branches (which also contain large quantities of carbon) might exhibit different growth dynamics from the stem7.

Second, at a seasonal scale, growth encompasses two distinctive processes involved in wood formation8: on the one hand, cell proliferation and enlargement are responsible for growth in terms of size; on the other hand, cell-wall thickening and deposition of complex organic polymers called lignins are responsible for growth in terms of weight. To add to the complexity, these two processes exhibit different dynamics and are related to different environmental factors — their seasonal maxima synchronize with the maximum length of daylight (photoperiod) in the case of growth in size, and with temperature for weight gain5.

25 years of valuing ecosystems in decision-making

Dow and colleagues’ study provides evidence that warmer springs have advanced the leaf emergence of temperate deciduous forests but have not substantially increased their wood production. This suggests that the extra CO 2 uptake does not contribute to sustainable carbon sequestration in the trunks of long-lived trees. The fate of this extra carbon is unknown, but another group has proposed that carbon taken up by trees might be directly emitted back into the atmosphere9."
bc293b42-b0da-4264-94e8-aabe562bda42,"The House of Representatives passed the Inflation Reduction Act on Friday, clearing the way for President Biden to sign the landmark climate and healthcare bill into law. The legislation passed along party lines, as Democrats overcame unified GOP opposition.

Republicans banded together to vote by proxy in order to deny a physical quorum. The bill still passed, but Republicans are hoping the move will open up an avenue for a legal challenge of the bill’s passage, Axios reported ahead of the vote. Proxy votes are part of a quorum needed to pass legislation, as a House resolution passed by the current Congress made clear, but the matter hasn’t been ruled on by a court. According to the report, Republicans would support a lawsuit from a company looking to challenge the bill over its tax implication.

While far from Democrats’ initial proposal, the act pledges a substantial cutback in greenhouse gas emissions, hoping to realize those cuts via massive tax credits — $400 billion over 10 years — for green energy development and deployment. The Biden administration has set a goal of cutting U.S. emissions to half of 2005 levels by 2030, and this bill aims go a long way toward that goal, with analysts saying it would produce a 40 percent reduction from 2005 levels by decade’s end.

On the healthcare side, it caps out-of-pocket expenses prescription drug for those on Medicare to $2,000 annually, allows Medicare to negotiate prices with prescription drug manufactures, and funds the Affordable Care Act for three years. Among other provisions, it also allocates $80 billion to the IRS in part to boost enforcement, despite the objections of Republicans who made claims that were either misleading or false.

Revenue from corporate tax increases and prescription drug savings would amount to roughly $700 billion, while the government would spend about $400 billion on climate-friendly energy and on healthcare.

The act passed the Senate last Sunday, with Vice President Kamala Harris casting the tie-breaking vote in a divided chamber, but not before Republicans stripped a provision limiting out-of-pocket insulin costs for buyers with private insurance. In order to reach the 50-vote threshold, Democratic leaders made concessions to moderate Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) regarding the Wall Street-friendly carried interest tax loophole and a gas pipeline in West Virginia, respectively."
8f12cc7b-c631-450b-ab44-dc16bc6b0014,"The U.S. House of Representatives passed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 on Friday, clearing the way for President Biden to sign the biggest investment in combating climate change in the nation’s history.

The legislation was an unexpected resurrection of some pieces of Biden’s Build Back Better agenda, pulled together in a surprising deal by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., the most conservative member of the Democratic caucus. The bill moved quickly: A deal was announced on July 27, it passed the Senate on Aug. 7 and cleared the House only days later.

With four Republican House members not voting, the bill was passed with unanimous support from House Democrats but no Republican votes. The Senate vote was also divided along party lines at 50-50, with all Republicans in opposition and Vice President Kamala Harris casting the tie-breaking vote.

The Inflation Reduction Act will assign $369 billion to the mitigation of climate change over 10 years by making electric vehicles more affordable, developing clean energy and improving energy efficiency in everything from home appliances to industrial processes. It also fulfills a longtime Democratic campaign promise of lowering prescription drug prices by allowing Medicare to directly negotiate with pharmaceutical companies, which would cap out-of-pocket drug costs for older Americans.

It will also provide subsidies for Obamacare premiums set to expire, keeping health care costs down for many Americans.

Funding for the bill will come from raising taxes on some corporations that make over $1 billion annually in profits, taxing corporate stock buybacks and funding the Internal Revenue Service to better go after tax cheats. The total legislative package is projected to lower the federal deficit by as much as $300 billion over the next decade. By reducing the deficit and lowering the cost of energy and prescription drugs, Democrats hope the bill will also lessen inflation.

Due to Republican opposition, Democrats were not able to include a cap on insulin prices for Americans with private insurance. Sen. Bernie Sanders tried to add an extension of the expanded child tax credit — which took millions of children out of poverty in 2021 — and provide Medicare recipients with dental, vision and hearing coverage but was voted down.

Other plans dropped from the original Biden proposal included paid family leave and free pre-kindergarten. In order to earn the vote of Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., her fellow Democrats nixed a change that would have resulted in hedge fund and private equity fund managers paying the same tax rate on their incomes as other employees, closing a loophole that currently lets them pay a lower capital gains tax rate.

The Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, is the first significant legislation to combat climate change ever passed by the United States, which is the world’s largest cumulative emitter of the greenhouse gasses causing global warming. It will attempt to reduce emissions through a variety of means, the largest of which will be a heavy investment in tax credits for consumers who buy electric vehicles, solar panels and more efficient appliances that can replace gas or oil burners.

Most of these programs are targeted at low- and moderate-income households. A family that takes advantage of every possible rebate and credit could enjoy a total of $28,500 in incentives for reducing their carbon footprint, and save an average of $1,800 per year in reduced gasoline, energy and heating costs.

There will also be billions of dollars in grants to state and local governments to switch their fleets to electric vehicles and to help utilities switch from gas- or coal-burning power plants to clean energy such as wind or solar power. In order to win Sinema’s support, there will also be $4 billion for projects to help residents of the Southwest conserve water to deal with the ongoing climate change-related megadrought in that region.

The IRA will spend $20 billion to promote climate-smart agriculture practices and $5 billion for forest conservation and urban tree planting.

All of those victories came at a cost, however. To win the support of Manchin, who hails from a state rich in coal and gas, Democrats agreed to require the Department of the Interior to lease 2 million acres in federal lands and 60 million acres offshore annually for oil and gas extraction. That will violate Biden’s own campaign pledge to end new federal fossil fuel leasing. Manchin also secured a commitment from Schumer to attempt to pass legislation that would speed up the federal permitting process for energy development projects.

Most environmental experts and activists endorsed the bill, saying the tradeoff is acceptable on balance. Former Vice President Al Gore, who has been outspoken on the issue for four decades, called the IRA “transformative” and said it was “a long time coming.”

However, some campaigners who are more focused on opposing fossil fuel production — including many Indigenous activists from communities near oil and gas wells and pipelines — were outraged by the fossil fuel extraction provisions.

Still, at a time when gasoline prices have surged and concern that money spent on oil benefits petro-state dictators such as Russian President Vladimir Putin, the bill is expected to reduce dependence on oil and U.S. vulnerability to oil and gas supply shocks like the one caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Overall, the IRA is expected to help annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions drop by between 37% and 41% from 2005 levels by 2030, and to prevent between 3,700 and 3,900 premature deaths per year thanks to reduced air pollution, according to modeling developed by the think tank Energy Innovation. The group also found that every ton of emissions generated by the new oil and gas leasing will be offset by at least 24 tons of emissions reduced by the other bill’s provisions.

Despite that, the bill on its own will fall short of Biden’s pledge to reduce emissions by 50% by 2030. Climate activists continue to call on Biden to help close the gap between the emissions goal and what the IRA will achieve by issuing new regulations on pollution generated by burning fossil fuels.

Some Republicans are saying that the bill will result in nearly 100,000 new IRS agents targeting middle-class Americans, but there’s nothing in the language of the bill stating that, according to fact checkers, and some of the funding will go to revamping the agency’s outdated technology. Republicans have also claimed that the bill contains a tax hike on working-class Americans, but no individual earning under $400,000 will be directly affected. The new 15% minimum tax on many larger corporations, however, could increase costs for consumers.

A Yahoo News/YouGov poll released earlier this month found the bill to be broadly popular, particularly the part that lowers the cost of Medicare prescription drugs. Democrats will now return to the campaign trail in an attempt to hold control of Congress, hoping that the provisions in the IRA, combined with the backlash to the Supreme Court’s decision on abortion and decreasing gas prices can help mitigate the typical midterm backlash against the party controlling the White House.

In a memo circulated on Capitol Hill earlier this month, Biden’s pollsters wrote of the IRA that “Democrats should confidently support these measures, and campaign on them aggressively, putting Republicans on defense.”"

The House of Representatives voted Friday to pass Democrats’ $750 billion health care, energy and climate bill, in a significant victory for President Joe Biden and his party.

The final vote was 220-207, along party lines. Four Republicans did not vote.

Now that the Democratic-controlled House has approved the bill, it will next go to Biden to be signed into law.

Final passage of the bill marks a milestone for Democrats and gives the party a chance to achieve long-sought policy objectives ahead of the upcoming midterm elections. It comes at a critical time as Democrats are fighting to retain control of narrow majorities in Congress.

The sweeping bill – named the Inflation Reduction Act – would represent the largest climate investment in US history and make major changes to health policy by giving Medicare the power for the first time to negotiate the prices of certain prescription drugs and extending expiring health care subsidies for three years. The legislation would reduce the deficit, be paid for through new taxes – including a 15% minimum tax on large corporations and a 1% tax on stock buybacks – and boost the Internal Revenue Service’s ability to collect.

It would raise over $700 billion in government revenue over 10 years and spend over $430 billion to reduce carbon emissions and extend subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act and use the rest of the new revenue to reduce the deficit.

House acts after Senate Democrats passed the bill

The House took up the legislation after it passed in the Senate following a marathon overnight session of contentious amendment votes.

In the Senate, the bill passed on a final, party-line vote of 51-50, with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the tie.

Senate Democrats, who control only a narrow 50-seat majority, ultimately stayed unified to pass the legislation. And they used a special, filibuster-proof process known as reconciliation to approve the measure without Republican votes.

Approval of the bill in the chamber marked a major milestone for Senate Democrats, who had long hoped to pass a signature legislative package, but had struggled for months to reach a deal that had the full support of their caucus.

Sen. Joe Manchin played a key role in shaping the legislation – which only moved forward after the West Virginia Democrat and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a deal at the end of July, a key breakthrough for Democrats after earlier negotiations had stalled out.

Arizona Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema was also at the center of the effort to pass the bill – and Sinema, Manchin and other senators worked through the weekend making alterations on the bill.

Passage in the Senate came after a lengthy stretch of amendment votes known as a “vote-a-rama” that lasted nearly 16 hours from late Saturday night until Sunday afternoon.

Republicans used the weekend “vote-a-rama” to put Democrats on the spot and force politically tough votes. They were also successful in removing a key provision to cap the price of insulin to $35 per month on the private insurance market, which the Senate parliamentarian ruled was not compliant with the Senate’s reconciliation rules. The $35 insulin cap for Medicare beneficiaries remains in place.

In the end, Republicans lined up to oppose the bill. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement that the bill included “giant job-killing tax hikes” and amounted to “a war on American fossil fuel.” The Kentucky Republican said Democrats “do not care about middle-class families’ priorities.”

How the bill addresses the climate crisis

While economists disagree over whether the package would, in fact, live up to its name and reduce inflation, particularly in the short term, the bill would have a crucial impact on reducing carbon emissions.

The nearly $370 billion clean energy and climate package is the largest climate investment in US history, and the biggest victory for the environmental movement since the landmark Clean Air Act.

Analysis from Schumer’s office – as well as multiple independent analyses – suggests the measure would reduce US carbon emissions by up to 40% by 2030. Strong climate regulations from the Biden administration and action from states would be needed to get to Biden’s goal of cutting emissions 50% by 2030.

The bill also contains many tax incentives meant to bring down the cost of electricity with more renewables, and spur more American consumers to switch to electricity to power their homes and vehicles.

Key health care and tax policy in the bill

The bill would empower Medicare to negotiate prices of certain costly medications administered in doctors’ offices or purchased at the pharmacy. The Health and Human Services secretary would negotiate the prices of 10 drugs in 2026, and another 15 drugs in 2027 and again in 2028. The number would rise to 20 drugs a year for 2029 and beyond.

The controversial provision is far more limited than the one House Democratic leaders have backed in the past. But it would open the door to fulfilling a longstanding party goal of allowing Medicare to use its heft to lower drug costs.

Democrats are also planning to extend the enhanced federal premium subsidies for Obamacare coverage through 2025, a year later than lawmakers recently discussed. That way, they wouldn’t expire just after the 2024 presidential election.

To boost revenue, the bill would impose a 15% minimum tax on the income large corporations report to shareholders, known as book income, as opposed to the Internal Revenue Service. The measure, which would raise $258 billion over a decade, would apply to companies with profits over $1 billion.

Concerned about how this provision would affect certain businesses, particularly manufacturers, Sinema has suggested that she won changes to the Democrats’ plan to pare back how companies can deduct depreciated assets from their taxes. The details remain unclear.

However, Sinema nixed her party’s effort to tighten the carried interest loophole, which allows investment managers to treat much of their compensation as capital gains and pay a 20% long-term capital gains tax rate instead of income tax rates of up to 37%.

The provision would have lengthened the amount of time investment managers’ profit interest must be held from three years to five years to take advantage of the lower tax rate. Addressing this loophole, which would have raised $14 billion over a decade, had been a longtime goal of congressional Democrats.

In its place, a 1% excise tax on companies’ stock buybacks was added, raising another $74 billion, according to a Democratic aide."
8aa68a03-551e-4b31-9a50-f0ee09f89a95,"But Democrats hope to capitalize on the win, emphasizing that they have delivered on long-held promises, even though it could take years to see the benefits from some of the longer-term proposals.

“They’re seeing Democrats as the party that’s actually getting this stuff done and everyone else is trying to start a culture war or attacking the F.B.I.,” said Representative Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat who is running for the Senate. “The contrast in the last few months is becoming very stark.”

Approval of the legislation capped an arduous stretch of negotiations for Democrats. With Republicans unanimously opposed, Democrats focused on their own ranks and worked to find a compromise that would not only appease a left flank eager to pass an expansive plan that would transform the nation’s social safety net, but that also would secure the votes of key centrist holdouts reluctant to endorse billions in new spending as inflation climbed.

Democrats used the fast-track budget reconciliation process to navigate the legislation through both chambers, allowing them to sidestep the filibuster — the same tactic they used last year with the $1.9 trillion pandemic aid package. Cut entirely out of the process, Republicans fumed that the climate and health bill would do little to address inflation and criticized it for raising taxes and federal spending. (Many economists agree the bill is likely to dampen inflation, though modestly and not immediately.)

The bill falls far short of the $2.2 trillion Build Back Better Act, which Ms. Pelosi wrangled to passage in the House in November. That bill included far more substantial changes to the tax code, as well as billions of dollars to create a federal paid leave program, provide support for most families with children, and expand housing, home care and public education. The social spending plan’s fate was initially tied to passage of the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law, and it teetered repeatedly on the brink of failure, as centrists in the Democratic Party demanded that the party whittle it down.

But the package stalled in the Senate a month later, when Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, a centrist Democrat, rejected it as exorbitant and walked away from talks. Though negotiations between Mr. Manchin and Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, resumed this spring, they faltered again last month, leaving Democrats to grapple with the prospect of enacting just a health care package.

“You’re reminded of how difficult legislating is even when you have big majorities, never mind when you have a tiny one,” said Representative Richard Neal of Massachusetts, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, who like other Democrats dangled the possibility of revisiting more tax increases and other priorities should the party retain and expand their majority."
3ac7919b-e637-4f8c-a5af-67c8780132da,"WASHINGTON — The House passed a far-reaching Democratic bill Friday to combat climate change, extend health care coverage and raise taxes on corporations, voting along party lines to send the legislation to President Joe Biden for his signature.

Passage of the Inflation Reduction Act represents a major victory for Democrats ahead of the November midterm elections, capping nearly a year of on-again, off-again internal negotiations and defying numerous near-death experiences for the bill.

The legislation — which passed the Senate on Sunday in a 51-50 vote, with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the tie — now goes to Biden, who plans to sign it into law next week.

“We’ve had a lot of achievements under President Biden: the rescue package and infrastructure bill and CHIPS and Science. It’s quite a collection. But this is remarkable,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi told NBC News on Friday. “This is a source of joy.”

The House vote was 220-207, breaking evenly along party lines as Democrats unified to support the bill while Republicans unanimously voted against it.

Biden chided Republicans for opposing the legislation in a video he tweeted after the vote.

“Today the American people won and the special interests lost, finally,” Biden said. “The Democrats sided with the American people and the Republicans sided with special interests. That’s the choice we face: whether we protect the already powerful or have the courage to build a future where everybody has an even shot.”

In the run-up to the vote, Pelosi highlighted four key provisions in the bill: empowering Medicare to negotiate drug prices, extending Affordable Care Act funding for three years, enacting a series of energy and climate change provisions, and reducing the deficit.

The legislation would raise about $700 billion through corporate tax increases and prescription drug savings, and it would spend about $400 billion on clean energy and health care provisions.

It was a rare defeat for the pharmaceutical lobby on Capitol Hill. But other influential industries, like private equity, defeated some of the provisions that would have negatively affected them.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., predicted that “the Inflation Reduction Act will endure as one of the defining legislative feats of the 21st century.”

GOP hits 'half a trillion spending spree'

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., pushed all Republicans to vote against the bill, calling it a “half a trillion spending spree that would raise taxes during a recession.”

“When this bill comes to the House, I urge everyone to vote No,” he said in a recent statement.

The package falls far short of what most Democrats had wanted, with safety net items stripped out by Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and a slew of tax increases blocked by Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz. But privately, Pelosi's message to colleagues was: Judge the bill for what it does, not what it doesn't do. In the end, Democrats embraced it.

Moderate Democrats said it would cut costs on energy and health care, citing the deficit savings to argue it would reduce inflation.

""I think it is absolutely phenomenal for Ohio,"" said Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, who is running for Senate in a Republican-leaning state.

And progressives hailed the largest package in U.S. history to combat climate change, which addresses the issue through a slew of benefits for electric vehicles and clean energy products.

""In terms of climate, this is the most consequential piece of legislation we will pass,"" said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., the chair of the progressive caucus. ""It is also the first time that we are at least getting a toe in the door of Big Pharma is price gouging.""

At the same time, Jayapal said she is “heartbroken” that the measure excludes a host of other Democratic priorities, including guaranteed paid family leave, child care funding, child tax credit payments, universal pre-K and immigration relief.

Republicans have blasted the new taxes in the bill as well as the additional funding for IRS enforcement, warning it would lead to more audits. Democrats argue the legislation provides a mechanism to target sophisticated tax evaders and bolster refund processing and customer service for ordinary Americans.

Overshadowed by Trump?

Rep. Bob Good, R-Va., lit into Democrats for focusing on climate change. “There is no climate crisis,” he said in an impassioned floor speech. “It is a hoax.”

Some Republicans did see a silver lining: The Democratic bill preserves most of the Republican tax cuts of 2017, largely at the insistence of Sinema, who objected to any rate increases.

Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, an author of the 2017 law, said it is “largely protected” in the new Democratic bill, although he said the 15% corporate minimum tax would be damaging. “Yes, a large part of the Republican tax cuts — the Trump tax cuts — are in place.”

The vote came at a time when much of the national spotlight was seized by the fallout over a recent FBI search of former President Donald Trump's property Mar-a-Lago.

It was a source of frustration for some Democrats, who had preferred to spend this week boasting about the bill.

""I don't think it'll be overshadowed by Trump. But Trump is like a planetary object that has its own gravity, and that certainly pulls in a lot of the public attention,"" said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.

Democrats said the bill was more important.

""The news and the history books often don't rhyme. And I think when people look back at this period, they'll write more — much more — about the largest climate investment that the country has ever made than anything else,"" said Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif.

Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y., the chair of the Democrats' congressional campaign arm, said inflation reduction ""can't happen soon enough"" and that Americans are more attuned to their lives.

""I think my voters care a lot more about what's in their paycheck than what's in Trump's basement,"" he said."

WASHINGTON (AP) — A divided Congress gave final approval Friday to Democrats’ flagship climate and health care bill , handing President Joe Biden a back-from-the-dead triumph on coveted priorities that the party hopes will bolster their prospects for keeping their House and Senate majorities in November’s elections.

The House used a party-line 220-207 vote to pass the legislation, prompting hugs among Democrats on the House floor and cheers by White House staff watching on television. “Today, the American people won. Special interests lost,” tweeted the vacationing Biden, who was shown beaming in a White House photo as he watched the vote on TV from Kiawah Island, South Carolina. He said he would sign the legislation next week.

The measure is but a shadow of the larger, more ambitious plan to supercharge environment and social programs that Biden and his party unveiled early last year. Even so, Democrats happily declared victory on top-tier goals like providing Congress’ largest ever investment in curbing carbon emissions, reining in pharmaceutical costs and taxing large companies, hoping to show they can wring accomplishments from a routinely gridlocked Washington that often disillusions voters.

“Today is a day of celebration, a day we take another giant step in our momentous agenda,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who minutes later announced the final vote as she presided over the chamber. She said the measure “meets the moment, ensuring that our families thrive and that our planet survives.”

Republicans solidly opposed the legislation, calling it a cornucopia of wasteful liberal daydreams that would raise taxes and families’ living costs. They did the same Sunday but Senate Democrats banded together and used Vice President Kamala Harris’ tiebreaking vote t o power the measure through that 50-50 chamber.

“Democrats, more than any other majority in history, are addicted to spending other people’s money, regardless of what we as a country can afford,” said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. “I can almost see glee in their eyes.”

Biden’s initial 10-year, $3.5 trillion proposal also envisioned free prekindergarten, paid family and medical leave, expanded Medicare benefits and eased immigration restrictions. That crashed after centrist Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said it was too costly, using the leverage every Democrat has in the evenly-divided Senate.

Still, the final legislation remained substantive. Its pillar is about $375 billion over 10 years to encourage industry and consumers to shift from carbon-emitting to cleaner forms of energy. That includes $4 billion to cope with the West’s catastrophic drought.

Spending, tax credits and loans would bolster technology like solar panels, consumer efforts to improve home energy efficiency, emission-reducing equipment for coal- and gas-powered power plants and air pollution controls for farms, ports and low-income communities.

Another $64 billion would help 13 million people pay premiums over the next three years for privately bought health insurance. Medicare would gain the power to negotiate its costs for pharmaceuticals, initially in 2026 for only 10 drugs. Medicare beneficiaries’ out-of-pocket prescription costs would be limited to $2,000 starting in 2025, and beginning next year would pay no more than $35 monthly for insulin, the costly diabetes drug.

The bill would raise around $740 billion in revenue over the decade, over a third from government savings from lower drug prices. More would flow from higher taxes on some $1 billion corporations, levies on companies that repurchase their own stock and stronger IRS tax collections. About $300 billion would remain to defray budget deficits, a sliver of the period’s projected $16 trillion total.

Against the backdrop of GOP attacks on the FBI for its court-empowered search of former President Donald Trump’s Florida estate for sensitive documents, Republicans repeatedly savaged the bill’s boost to the IRS budget. That’s aimed at collecting an estimated $120 billion in unpaid taxes over the coming decade, and Republicans have misleadingly claimed that the IRS will hire 87,000 agents to target average families.

Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., said Democrats would also “weaponize” the IRS with agents, “many of whom will be trained in the use of deadly force, to go after any American citizen.” Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, asked Thursday on “Fox and Friends” if there would be an IRS “strike force that goes in with AK-15s already loaded, ready to shoot some small business person.”

Few IRS personnel are armed, and Democrats say the bill’s $80 billion, 10-year budget increase would be to replace waves of retirees, not just agents, and modernize equipment. They have said typical families and small businesses would not be targeted, with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen directing the IRS this week to not “increase the share of small business or households below the $400,000 threshold” that would be audited.

Republicans say the legislation’s new business taxes will increase prices, worsening the nation’s bout with its worst inflation since 1981. Though Democrats have labeled the measure the Inflation Reduction Act, nonpartisan analysts say it will have a barely perceptible impact on prices.

The GOP also says the bill would raise taxes on lower- and middle-income families . An analysis by Congress’ nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, which didn’t include the bill’s tax breaks for health care and energy, estimated that the corporate tax boosts would marginally affect those taxpayers but indirectly, partly due to lower stock prices and wages.

“House Democrats ensured voters will fire them this fall,” said spokeswoman Torunn Sinclair of the House GOP campaign committee. In an email, she listed dozens of Democrats in competitive reelections who will face Republican attacks for raising taxes and empowering the IRS “to target their constituents.”

Democratic-leaning interest groups had their own warnings. “We’ll ensure that every Republican who voted against this bill is held accountable for prioritizing polluters and corporate special interests over the health and well being of their constituents,” said Tiernan Sittenfeld, a top official of the League of Conservation Voters.

The bill caps three months in which Congress has approved legislation on veterans’ benefits, the semiconductor industry, gun checks for young buyers and Ukraine’s invasion by Russia and adding Sweden and Finland to NATO. All passed with bipartisan support, suggesting Republicans also want to display their productive side.

It’s unclear whether voters will reward Democrats for the legislation after months of painfully high inflation dominating voters’ attention, Biden’s dangerously low popularity ratings and a steady history of midterm elections that batter the party holding the White House.

Biden called his $3.5 trillion plan Build Back Better. Besides social and environment initiatives, it proposed rolling back Trump-era tax breaks for the rich and corporations and $555 billion for climate efforts, well above the money in Friday’s legislation.

With Manchin opposing those amounts, it was sliced to a roughly $2 trillion measure that Democrats moved through the House in November . He unexpectedly sank that bill too, earning scorn from exasperated fellow Democrats from Capitol Hill and the White House.

Last gasp talks between Manchin and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., seemed fruitless until the two unexpectedly announced agreement last month on the new package.

Manchin won concessions for the fossil fuel industries he champions, including procedures for more oil drilling on federal lands. So did Centrist Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., who ended up eliminating planned higher taxes on hedge fund managers and helping win the drought funds.

It’s been 126 years since Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius concluded that greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels could cause Earth’s temperature to rise; 53 years since Daniel Patrick Moynihan, when he was an advisor to President Nixon, warned that the “carbon dioxide problem” could inundate New York City and Washington, D.C.; and 34 years since climate scientist James Hansen testified to Congress “with 99% certainty” that global warming had already begun.

After all that time, the U.S. Senate — that deliberative, careful lawmaking body — has passed a climate bill.

The Inflation Reduction Act is a product of weird and idiosyncratic circumstances, including the filibuster and a parliamentary maneuver called “budget reconciliation.” With a 50-50 partisan split in the Senate and Republicans largely unwilling to act on the climate, the bill’s passage hinged on two Democratic caucus swing votes — one of whom, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, made his fortune off coal.

My colleague Jennifer Haberkorn has a story on the Senate vote, and on the sweeping bill’s non-climate provisions. The House of Representatives is expected to approve the legislation on Friday, with President Biden’s signature coming soon after.

Strange circumstances aside, the Inflation Reduction Act is a big deal, with nearly $370 billion in climate and clean energy spending. Canary Media’s Jeff St. John wrote about the tax credits and rebates that could help families afford electric heat pumps and solar panels, while his colleague Julian Spector detailed the lucrative battery storage incentives. Canary’s Eric Wesoff is hopeful the bill could finally spur a U.S. solar manufacturing boom where protectionist tariffs have failed.

The bill also includes $3 billion in loans and grants to support construction of new power lines — key tools for moving solar and wind energy from places where it’s abundant to cities where it’s needed, as I’ve written previously.

At least some companies foresee problems. As Jael Holzman writes for E&E News, the auto industry worries the bill “might actually slow the nation’s switch away from gas-powered cars,” because it changes the rules for electric vehicle tax credits to require that a certain percentage of battery components come from the United States. If not, no tax credits.

That was a key priority for Manchin, who says America is far too dependent on China for battery materials such as lithium. But although there are companies trying to build up a U.S. battery supply chain — see the folks drilling for lithium at California’s Salton Sea, and the deal Toyota just signed to buy lithium from the proposed Rhyolite Ridge mine in Nevada — it’s not clear whether enough of those types of projects will be ready in time to make the tax credits work as intended.

Climate advocates have their own issues with the legislation — including the fact that it all but requires the federal government to keep leasing public lands and waters for oil and gas drilling, as demanded by Manchin.

Most clean energy activists are enthusiastically supporting the bill anyway, citing analyses like this one that have found the climate benefits far outweigh the losses. But the leasing provision is still a bitter pill to swallow for “keep it in the ground” activists, who over the last decade campaigned to end federal oil and gas leasing, turning a fringe idea into Democratic Party orthodoxy.

Conservationists are especially unhappy the bill will require previously canceled offshore lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska to move forward, and won’t ban new drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Details here from Alex DeMarban and Riley Rogerson at the Anchorage Daily News.

Then there’s the permitting side deal. To win Manchin’s support, Democratic leaders in the Senate and House agreed to hold votes on yet-to-be-written legislation that would speed the federal approval process for all kinds of energy projects — including fossil fuel pipelines and natural gas export plants, like the ones Sempra Energy of San Diego is developing in Mexico.

Although it’s not yet clear what the permitting legislation will include, Manchin is adamant that it lead to approval of the Mountain Valley Pipeline, a controversial gas line through the Appalachian Mountains whose developers — along with other pipeline companies — have become some of his biggest campaign contributors, as Hiroko Tabuchi reports for the New York Times.

On the flip side, the permitting bill could also lead to easier approval of clean energy infrastructure.

That would be a big deal, because land use is quickly becoming a major obstacle to accelerating the clean energy buildout, as I wrote after the Senate bill’s passage. Across the country, there’s rampant local-level opposition to wind and solar farms, transmission lines and lithium mines — over aesthetics, property values, loss of farmland and even environmental concerns.

Some experts tell me the best solution is for developers and government agencies to take local concerns seriously and work with communities to make clean energy work for them. But that’s not the only option. In California, local governments are furious over a new law that gives state officials greater control over solar and wind farm approval, CalMatters’ Julie Cart writes.

An especially contentious land-use battle recently came to an end in the California desert, with the U.S. Interior Department announcing the 457-megawatt Palen solar farm is fully online. As I’ve written previously, environmental groups including the Sierra Club tried to block the project, saying it could harm animals such as the desert tortoise and the Mojave fringe-toed lizard.

Anyway, it wasn’t just Manchin making demands — Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, the other Democratic swing vote, helped secure a last-minute addition of $4 billion in drought relief for the Colorado River Basin. The money could be used to pay farmers in California’s Imperial County and Arizona’s Yuma County to leave land fallow, per the Desert Sun’s Janet Wilson and the Arizona Republic’s Zayna Syed — a potentially useful tool as the federal government demands massive cuts in Colorado River water use.

There’s plenty of other stuff in the bill, including tax credits and grants for climate-friendly aviation fuels, a $27-billion green bank and tens of billions of dollars for sustainable farming and environmental justice efforts. Some oil and gas companies will have to pay fees as high as $1,500 a ton on methane leaks, although in a concession to Manchin, much of the fossil fuel industry will be exempted from the payments, Reuters’ Valerie Volcovici and Nichola Groom report.

All of those elements matter. But it’s also important not to lose track of the big picture.

The climate outlook was pretty dire before the Senate passed this bill, and it’s only somewhat less dire now, with a scary reality of worsening fires, storms, droughts and heat waves continuing to play out before our eyes. This legislation should help reduce heat-trapping emissions, but it’s not enough. Scientists say much more must be done on climate.

Which brings us to California.

As my colleague Taryn Luna reports, Gov. Gavin Newsom is pushing lawmakers to strengthen the state’s climate goals before the legislative session ends Aug. 31. He wants them to pass a law increasing the state’s carbon reduction target to 55% below 1990 levels by 2030, and mandating economy-wide carbon neutrality by 2045. He’s also urging the Legislature to set a goal of 90% climate-friendly electricity by 2035 — well ahead of an existing law requiring 100% by 2045.

“We need to up our game,” said Lauren Sanchez, Newsom’s senior climate advisor.

Additionally, Newsom wants lawmakers to ban new oil and gas drilling within 3,200 feet of homes and schools — the same distance required in a draft regulation from last year that hasn’t been finalized. The governor’s proposal also calls for carbon-capture rules that “minimiz[e] impacts to communities where these technologies and projects are developed” — a priority for climate justice activists, who worry that carbon capture will prolong the life of highly polluting fossil fuel facilities.

Separately, the California Energy Commission voted Wednesday to set a long-term goal of installing 25 gigawatts of offshore wind power. That’s 600 times more offshore wind than the entire U.S. has built so far, and as much capacity as 11 Diablo Canyon nuclear plants.

There’s a big difference between setting a goal and actually building ocean wind turbines. But Sanchez is optimistic.

“Offshore wind represents one of the greatest climate, clean energy and economic opportunities,” she told me. “There is an incredible global market that China and others currently lead, but that California hopes to double down on.”

Only time will tell — on offshore wind, and on climate action more broadly. And after decades of meandering, time is short.

But the willingness of 50 senators to stake their claim to a climate bill is a big deal. Change is afoot.

On that note, here’s what’s happening around the West:

It’s been 32 years since a New Mexico uranium mill shut down — but nearby communities are still suffering from a legacy of deadly radiation that the federal government and Canadian mining giant Barrick Gold have failed to clean up. That’s the conclusion of this startling investigation by ProPublica’s Mark Olalde and Maya Miller, co-published with the L.A. Times. Maya also wrote a valuable piece on why the radioactive gas radon is so dangerous, and how to know whether you’re at risk of exposure. In other toxic pollution news, the Environmental Protection Agency says the amount of DDT dumped off Southern California’s coast is even more than feared — which I didn’t think was possible after reading my colleague Rosanna Xia’s earlier coverage. And there may be all sorts of other toxic substances down there that we don’t know about yet.

The intense storms that flooded Las Vegas casinos and prompted the shutdown of Death Valley National Park in the last few days are exactly the kind of extreme weather that scientists expect more of as temperatures rise. So write The Times’ Alex Wigglesworth and Harriet Ryan in their story on the storms. (The same applies to the flash flood that closed one of my favorite desert spots, the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway.) In other climate disaster news, the Associated Press’ Seth Borenstein looks at new research that indicates extreme weather is leading to greater spread of infectious disease, and Kaiser Health News’ Emmarie Huetteman has an important story on the special danger that heat waves pose to kids. It’s no wonder young people are feeling climate anxiety — and in many cases becoming fierce climate advocates, as my colleague Melissa Gomez explores in a great piece.

Some Northern Californians are convinced the decline of the logging industry, caused in part by environmental rules, has led to worsening fires — even though many other factors are at play. Those deeply felt but factually questionable sentiments are a case study in political polarization, The Times’ Hayley Smith writes. Meanwhile, the McKinney fire continues to burn, surpassing 60,000 acres, destroying at least 87 homes and killing at least four people, including 73-year-old U.S. Forest Service fire lookout Kathy Shoopman. The blaze also contributed to a massive debris flow that appears to have killed an enormous number of fish in the Klamath River, including juvenile chinook and coho salmon, Alex Wigglesworth reports. In better news, Itzel Luna writes that Yosemite National Park has reopened the Mariposa Grove to the public after it survived the Washburn fire.

WATER IN THE WEST

A federal deadline for Colorado River Basin states to agree on a plan to radically cut water use is less than a week away. There are signs of progress — the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and the Imperial Irrigation District are negotiating a plan to forgo 400,000 acre-feet of water, the Desert Sun’s Janet Wilson reports. But the various parties across seven states don’t seem close to a deal of the scope and scale federal officials say is necessary. And in the meantime, reservoir levels continue to fall. Human remains were just found at Lake Mead for the fourth time since May, and there’s a worrying new report from environmental groups making the case that “antiquated plumbing” at Lake Powell could diminish the reservoir’s ability to send water downstream, per Zak Podmore at the Salt Lake Tribune. And while the Colorado River situation is bad on this side of the border, it’s much worse in the Mexican city of Ensenada, at the very end of the water priority line. Here’s the story from MacKenzie Elmer and Vicente Calderón at Voice of San Diego.

Colorado River Basin tribes say they’ve been largely excluded from the ongoing negotiations over cutting water use. That’s just not fair. It’s also not practical, since tribes have a legal right to a big chunk of the river. That’s a topic the Arizona Republic’s Debra Utacia Krol explores in a fabulous new series. She writes that tribes are increasingly asserting their right to water from the Colorado and its tributaries, but there are still far too many legal and physical obstacles to tribes using their water — a reality that one Indigenous activist describes as “just a continuation of the Indian wars.” Deb also wrote about tribes conserving water on their farms, and using their water to restore sections of the Colorado and its tributaries to pre-colonial conditions.

Angelenos cut water use 11% last month — a July record. Details here from my colleague Hayley Smith. It’s good news, even as we remember that learning to live in a drier West is more complicated that tearing out lawns and taking shorter showers. Just look to Northern California, where Asian American residents are suing Siskiyou County, claiming it’s only enforcing a certain drought rule in Asian American neighborhoods home to cannabis cultivation, as The Times’ Anh Do reports. Or look to Southern California, where Las Virgenes Municipal Water District tried and failed to secure more water from the state by arguing people need it to irrigate vegetation around their homes to reduce wildfire risk. Catalina Island is another interesting case study. Water shortages on the island aren’t nearly as bad as they were during the last drought, largely thanks to a small desalination plant. But residents are still taking water-saving measures that would put Angelenos to shame, Hayley Smith writes.

POLITICAL CLIMATE

San Diego could be the next major city to ban gas hookups in new construction — and in an even more dramatic move, officials hope to electrify almost all existing buildings over the next 12 years. Here’s the story from Joshua Emerson Smith at the San Diego Union-Tribune. In an interesting plot twist, the chief executive of Sempra Energy — parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co. — says he’s all good with the city’s plan, per the Union-Tribune’s Rob Nikolewski. As more homes switch to electricity for heating and cooking — L.A. is one of many cities making the transition — it will be more important than ever for utility companies to design electric rates that work for customers, and to explain those rates appropriately. At least so far, Southern California Edison is having some problems in that department, my colleague Kiera Feldman reports.

Angelenos will have a chance to vote on a ballot measure requiring the city to carve out more street space for bikers and pedestrians — unless the City Council gets there first. The initiative could reduce traffic deaths and pollution, although it’s definitely got critics, The Times’ Rachel Uranga writes. And it’s just one of the efforts underway to limit Southern California’s dependence on gasoline-fueled cars. The first electric people mover vehicle that will ferry travelers to and from Los Angeles International Airport arrived last week, and San Bernardino County is working on an underground tunnel to whisk travelers from a Metrolink station to Ontario International Airport in the Inland Empire, Summer Lin writes.

Seven years after the San Juan River was inundated with pollution from the Gold King Mine spill — which federal officials admit they caused — Navajo Nation farmers are still fighting the federal government for compensation, even as the Biden administration says environmental justice is a top priority.

AROUND THE WEST

In the California Delta — the estuary at the heart of the state’s water system — drought isn’t the only manifestation of the climate crisis. As the Pacific Ocean rises and river flows shrink, seawater is pushing farther inland and making water in the delta too salty to drink or use for irrigation, the Associated Press’ Kathleen Ronayne writes. One city is building an inland desalination plant to cope. Speaking of which — California Coastal Commission staff say the operator of a Carlsbad desalination plant violated its permit by failing to start a wetlands restoration project on time. Details here from the San Diego Union-Tribune’s Phil Diehl.

A longtime farming giant is trying to stop a wealthy Silicon Valley developer from moving water around the San Joaquin Valley as supplies dry up. The details of the dispute between J.G. Boswell Co. and John Vidovich are complex, but it all basically boils down to “a bitter legal fight between the two multimillion-dollar businesses, pitting old power against new money and ambition,” Lisa M. Krieger and Veronica Martinez write for the Mercury News. And it’s playing out against “a backdrop of deep distrust in the community about both companies’ hidden agendas,” they write.

I’d heard of coal seam fires — but I had no idea they’d become such a big problem in Montana. So I learned a lot from this in-depth investigation by Austyn Gaffney for High Country News on the seemingly vicious cycle of more wildfires ignited by burning coal seams and more coal seams ignited by worsening wildfires. It’s not great. I also had no idea that a great deal of medical equipment is sterilized with a carcinogenic chemical, ethylene oxide — and air-quality regulators say that chemical is leaking from some Southern California facilities where it’s used. Here’s the eye-opening story from my colleague Tony Briscoe.

The $369 billion in climate-related spending over 10 years targets five areas: consumer clean energy costs, decarbonizing various sectors of the economy, domestic clean energy manufacturing, environmental justice, and agriculture and land use. Taken together, these programs would help the U.S. reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40% from 2005 levels by 2030, and would save an estimated 3,700 to 3,900 lives per year thanks to cleaner air from a reduction in burning fossil fuels.

This approach represents a break from many past congressional proposals designed to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming, most of which proposed using a singular, overarching policy, such as taxing emissions or requiring tradable permits for emissions. Those measures all died in Congress, but this one made it through the Senate and is expected to pass the House later this week.

“The whole package in terms of dealing with climate change is a long-overdue improvement,” former Democratic Rep. Henry Waxman told Yahoo News on Tuesday. Waxman was chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee for many years, and he co-wrote a bill that passed the House but died in the Senate that would have capped carbon emissions and gradually reduced the number of tradable credits for them, a system known as cap-and-trade.

“Unlike other efforts in the past, such as cap-and-trade or a carbon tax, this approach gives a lot of incentives, financial especially, through the tax code and appropriations for industry to accomplish a reduction in emissions,” Waxman said. “This climate proposal has very little, if any, regulation. It’s a lot of incentives to develop, in effect, a partnership with industry and the government … to sharpen up the technology to accomplish our goals.”

Here’s a guide to the biggest programs in each bucket of climate policies, and what they will mean for American families.

Consumer clean energy costs

The IRA would pour money into helping homeowners, especially those with low and moderate incomes, and lower their carbon footprint and their energy bills by helping them transition to more efficient heating and cooling systems. There will be a $9 billion program to help low-income households switch to electric appliances (such as stoves) and to retrofit their homes for energy efficiency (by insulating windows, for example).

There will also be tax credits for replacing oil and gas burners with electric heat pumps and water heaters and installing rooftop solar, allowing customers to get 30% off the cost of these purchases.

To reduce dependence on oil, the bill would provide a $4,000 consumer tax credit for lower- and middle-income individuals to buy used electric vehicles, and a $7,500 tax credit to those who make less than $150,000 per year or couples who make less than $300,000 per year who buy new electric vehicles. (Qualifying EVs must cost less than $55,000 for cars and less than $80,000 for trucks.) There is also a $1 billion grant program to help local authorities make affordable housing more energy-efficient.

A family that uses all these rebates and tax credits could receive an additional grand total of $28,500 in incentives, according to the Center for American Progress. Rewiring America, an advocacy group that promotes electrification, estimates that a family that takes advantage of these incentives will save an average of $1,800 per year on home heating fuel and lower energy bills.

However, in order to win the crucial support of Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., the IRA requires that an EV eligible for the tax credit must have a battery built in North America with minerals mined or recycled there as well. Currently, most EVs on the market would not qualify. The purpose is to develop EV building capacity domestically, instead of relying on China, which is the main producer of lithium-ion batteries. But automakers have expressed doubts that they will be able to meet the bill’s requirements on its timeline.

Decarbonizing the economy

About $30 billion will be doled out in grants and loan programs to states and electric utilities to switch utilities from burning gas and coal to using clean energy sources such as wind and solar power. There are also grants and tax credits for clean commercial vehicles — think electric delivery trucks, buses and taxis — and money for efforts to reduce emissions from industrial processes, such as chemical, steel and cement plants.

In order to use the federal government’s buying power to catalyze private sector investment as well, the IRA contains $9 billion for the U.S. to buy clean technologies. For example, it includes $3 billion for the U.S. Postal Service to purchase zero-emission vehicles.

As part of this bill’s emphasis on equity, there is a $27 billion “clean energy technology accelerator” that will distribute funds to deploy clean energy technologies, especially in lower-income communities. An example of a recipient of these funds would be, say, a nonprofit that helps low-income renters, who can’t buy a solar panel for their own home, enjoy the cost savings of buying solar panels by pooling their money and buying solar panels to go in a public space and sharing in the savings

In a major win for environmentalists, there is also going to be a program to reduce the leakage of methane, a highly potent greenhouse gas, from oil and gas wells and pipelines. This is the rare portion of the IRA that includes sticks as well as carrots: grants to help the industry comply and the imposition of fees for operators that continue to leak methane at a high rate.

Domestic clean energy manufacturing

Whatever the costs and benefits of Manchin’s buy-American requirements for the EV tax credits, every Democrat agrees that developing the ability to produce the key ingredients of a clean energy economy within the United States would be beneficial. So the IRA includes $30 billion worth of tax credits for manufacturing solar panels, wind turbines, batteries capable of storing wind and solar energy, and the processing of key minerals needed for all those technologies (and for electric vehicles).

Separate from those tax credits for making the actual products, there are $10 billion in tax credits for building the infrastructure needed for that production, such as wind turbine and solar panel factories, and $2 billion for renovating auto factories to make EVs. The federal government will also offer up to $20 billion in loans to build new EV manufacturing facilities across the country and will provide $2 billion for additional clean energy research.

Environmental justice

Predominantly Black and Latino neighborhoods and poorer communities suffer an outsize share of the effects of climate change, such as extreme heat, flooding and the pollution from burning fossil fuels on highways and in factories and power plants. The IRA will give out $3 billion in block grants for community-led projects to deal with those kinds of problems, another $3 billion for neighborhood improvements like reconnecting areas separated by highways, $3 billion to reduce pollution at ports and $1 billion for electric heavy-duty vehicles, like garbage trucks.

Agriculture and land use

Plants absorb carbon dioxide, so how they are managed can affect how much carbon is in the atmosphere. The IRA will spend $20 billion on climate-smart agriculture practices (rotating crops instead of planting the same ones in the same place every year, for example) and $5 billion for forest conservation and urban tree planting.

The bill also incorporates tax credits and grants to support the domestic production of lower-carbon biofuels and $2.6 billion in grants to conserve and restore coastal areas that are needed both to absorb carbon and to manage storm surges that are becoming severe because of climate change, via rising sea levels and more intense storms.

The bill also includes some measures that were needed to win Manchin’s support that will actually make climate change worse, such as requirements that the federal government lease swaths of federal land and coastal areas for oil and gas drilling. As with the electric vehicles, Manchin is focused on producing as much energy domestically as possible. Still, the overwhelming majority of environmentalists are exultant at the IRA’s overall potential to reduce the severity of climate change.

The US Senate has passed a sweeping $US430 billion bill intended to fight climate change, lower drug prices and raise some corporate taxes, a major victory for President Joe Biden that Democrats hope will aid their chances of keeping control of Congress in this year’s elections.

After a marathon, 27-hour weekend session of debate and Republican efforts to derail the package, the Senate approved the legislation known as the Inflation Reduction Act by a 51-50 party line vote Vice President Kamala Harris cast the tie-breaking ballot.

The action sends the measure to the House of Representatives for a vote, likely on Friday when representatives plan to reconvene briefly during a summer recess.

They are expected to pass it, which would then send the bill to the White House for President Biden’s signature. In a statement, Mr Biden said he looked forward to signing the bill into law.

“The Senate is making history,” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said after pumping his fists in the air as Democrats cheered and their staff members responded to the vote with a standing ovation.

“To Americans who’ve lost faith that Congress can do big things, this bill is for you,” he said. “This bill is going to change America for decades.”

Senator Schumer said the legislation contained “the boldest clean energy package in American history” to fight climate change while reducing consumer costs for energy and some medicines.

Democrats have drawn harsh attacks from Republicans over the legislation’s $US430 billion ($623 billion) in new spending and roughly $US740 billion in new revenue.

Nevertheless, Democrats hope its passage will help the party’s House and Senate candidates in the November 8 midterm elections at a time when Mr Biden is suffering from anaemic public approval ratings amid high inflation.

The legislation is aimed at reducing carbon emissions and shifting consumers to green energy, while cutting prescription drug costs for the elderly and tightening enforcement on taxes for corporations and the wealthy.

Because the measure pays for itself and reduces the federal deficit over time, Democrats contend that it will help bring down inflation, an economic liability that has also weighed on their hopes of retaining legislative control in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election.

Republicans, arguing that the bill will not address inflation, have denounced the measure as a job-killing, left-wing spending wish list that could undermine growth when the economy is in danger of falling into recession.

Democrats approved the bill by using a parliamentary manoeuvre called reconciliation, which allows budget-related legislation to avoid the 100-seat chamber’s 60-vote threshold for most bills and pass on a simple majority.

After several hours of debate, the Senate began a rapid-fire “vote-a-rama” on Democratic and Republican amendments on Saturday night that stretched into Sunday afternoon.

Democrats repelled more than 30 Republican amendments, points of order and motions, all intended to scupper the legislation.

Senators were due to break for an August recess after the session."
30b7f8db-f273-447f-b030-02aa4b3ec612,"It suggests that without an upgraded carbon market structure, many Australian firms will find it harder to offset hard-to-abate emissions, particularly under the pending safeguard mechanism changes Energy Minister Chris Bowen has promised to have in place by July next year.

The Climate Change Authority’s review is unrelated to the Chubb review, which Mr Bowen established last month under former chief scientist Ian Chubb to look at the Emissions Reduction Fund, amid claims a large swath of the scheme’s carbon offsets are effectively fraudulent. That review is due to report by the end of the year.

Climate Change Authority chief executive officer Brad Archer said bringing together voluntary and compliance carbon markets “could help accelerate global decarbonisation and enhance integrity of carbon offsets”.

“It makes sense – and it is in Australia’s national interest – to play a leading role in the development of a liquid, high-integrity and effective global carbon market,” he said.

Mr Bowen said the government will respond to the report in due course and said his immediate focus is on the integrity and growth of the domestic carbon market.

“Through the Chubb report and our Powering Australia plan, the government will drive investment in high-quality offsets that are good for our regions as well as the climate,” Mr Bowen said.

The authority’s report includes 18 recommendations for Labor to consider, including on emerging rules around international carbon trading in accordance with Paris Agreement rules, and eligibility rules for the government’s Indo-Pacific Carbon Offsets Scheme.

“Carbon markets also provide a means of channelling public and private finance to support our regional neighbours leapfrog the emissions-intensive economic development trajectories of industrialised nations,” Mr Archer said.

“With Australia adopting a more ambitious 2030 emissions reduction target on the way to net-zero emissions by 2050, we can turn our minds to how governments and businesses can collaborate to achieve those goals as soon as possible and ensure Australia’s future prosperity.

“It’s important that offsets have integrity and that they are not double-counted, for example. Our review of the criteria applied to international carbon offsets will provide confidence in the quality and integrity of carbon offsets being used here.”

The Climate Change Authority is set for a major expansion under Labor’s benchmark legislation to enshrine a 43 per cent emissions target.

The bills, which passed the lower house last week ahead of an expected Senate vote next month, ramp up the authority’s role in providing parliament with regular scorecards on Australia’s emissions progress and the impact of government policies on the target.

The report argues that the role of existing voluntary carbon markets in reaching the 43 per cent target is not yet clear.

While the emissions of voluntary participants are counted in Australia’s national greenhouse inventory, international offsets do not.

In addition, the government needs to consider whether voluntary use of offsets to meet corporate targets should be included in Australia’s promises to the UN on emissions cuts."
7dfb1d9f-cff2-4f7f-ac13-af6b6ab44e1d,"The Greens have called on the Albanese government to reject advice that Australia should allow greater use of international carbon offsets, arguing it would delay cuts in greenhouse gas emissions locally.

A review of international offsets by the Climate Change Authority, a policy advisory body, urged the government to develop a carbon market strategy as a step towards allowing international carbon offsets to be traded along with Australian carbon credits.

Carbon offsets are bought by governments and businesses as an alternative to making their own emissions cuts. Each carbon credit is said to represent one tonne of carbon dioxide that has either been stopped from going into the atmosphere or drawn out of it.

Australian credits are issued by the Clean Energy Regulator and recognised as a valid way to help meet the national emissions reduction target. International offsets are not used in this system, but businesses and organisations can voluntarily buy them to meet self-imposed goals.

The review, which was commissioned in January by the Morrison government, found the carbon market in Australia was “fragmented, inefficient and complicated”. The authority’s chief executive, Brad Archer, said bringing the two systems together “could help accelerate global decarbonisation and enhance the integrity of carbon offsets”.

The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said the government should reject what he described as “international offset accounting tricks”, noting the European Union had decided last year to no longer allow international credits in its emissions trading scheme following concerns over system integrity.

“If climate action is left to accounting tricks, pollution will go up and we won’t stop the climate crisis,” he said.

“These international offsets just delay action and could also undercut our farmers, who could earn income from helping draw down pollution locally.”

The review points to a looming debate over the extent to which it is valid to use carbon credits while reducing emissions to net zero by 2050, a widely adopted global target. While the use of offsets has significant support – particularly among polluting companies promising to offset their impact on the planet – critics have raised concern about whether their overuse will delay a necessary shift away from fossil fuels.

The Climate Change Authority did not make a recommendation on how many credits should be allowed and said the international carbon market was still evolving in the wake of the 2015 Paris climate agreement and the gradual adoption of rules to govern it. Archer said there would always be a need for offsets but “we need to be reducing emissions wherever we can, as quickly as we can, where that makes sense to do it”.

The review was welcomed by the Carbon Market Institute, which represents businesses that generate credits and polluting companies that trade in them. “While the report recognises that these markets are still emerging and not perfect, it acts as a reminder of the significant role that they can play in coordinating business and government efforts to accelerate ambition,” the institute’s chief executive, John Connor, said.

The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, said the government would formally respond to its recommendations “in due course”, but its immediate focus was on the “integrity and growth” of the domestic carbon market.

Bowen has commissioned a review of the Australian system headed by the former chief scientist Prof Ian Chubb. It will consider allegations by Prof Andrew Macintosh, who spent years working on the integrity of the carbon credit system as chair of the Emissions Reduction Assurance Committee.

Macintosh described the domestic system as “largely a sham” and a fraud on taxpayers and the environment. In March, he released several academic papers with colleagues that set out a case that most Australian carbon credits do not actually represent real or new emissions cuts.

The Clean Energy Regulator, which is responsible for the system, rejects the allegations. The Chubb review is due to report by the end of the year."
f2bb66c3-3b1d-4b6a-ab6b-ddab76de6f60,"A key climate agency has opened the door for the Albanese government to allow Australian companies to buy international carbon credits to offset domestic emissions, sparking fresh warnings from climate advocates about controversial offshore schemes in developing countries.

The federal government last month upgraded Australia’s climate target under the Paris Agreement, pledging to cut emissions by 43 per cent by 2030. A key part of its plan to reach the target is to impose pollution caps on Australia’s 215 biggest greenhouse emitters under a beefed-up safeguard mechanism, which will tighten over time.

Companies captured by the safeguard mechanism must either adopt cleaner technology or pay to offset their emissions by buying credits from projects that sequester carbon. The policy will significantly increase demand for carbon credits, and experts are warning there will not be enough available on the domestic market for local polluters to stay under their cap.

def91745-2535-45a1-9cf4-9143c1a5455c,"Spurts of hot magma are flowing across Iceland’s Meradalir valley after a volcanic eruption began last week. Its source is a massive fissure about the length of three football fields, according to Forbes’ Eric Mack.

The volcanic activity has inspired more than 20,000 people to hike to the eruption site and soak in the view, per Jeremie Richard of the Agence France-Presse. The volcano is on Iceland’s Reykjanes peninsula, located about 25 miles southwest of the capital, Reykjavik.

According to the New York Times’ Michael Levenson, the Icelandic government said in a statement that the “relatively small” eruption posed little risk to populated areas and critical infrastructure, and that fissures like this one typically don’t lead to large explosions or columns of ash shooting into the stratosphere. But the government still advised people to stay away from the eruption site.

Even if an eruption appears safe to view at first, it won’t necessarily stay that way. “Eruptions can amp up their intensity at any moment, hurling not only molten lava but also large chunks of solid rock across startling distances,” writes Forbes.

Eruptions can also release toxic gases, such as sulfur dioxide, that can cause health problems, per Forbes. According to the Iceland Monitor, police have banned children under 12 from visiting the eruption site, since the emissions pose a greater risk to young children.

But for those intrepid hikers that do visit the eruption, officials have urged they take safety precautions. The Icelandic Meteorological Office warns that gas pollution at the site can exceed dangerous levels at any time and says it is safer for viewers to observe the eruption with their backs to the wind. The office also suggests that spectators move to higher ground when winds are calm.

Hjordis Gudmundsdottir, a spokesperson for Iceland’s civil protection agency, tells the Times that visitors should be wearing the proper clothing and footwear for the five-hour hike to and from the eruption site. “It’s not just a walk in the park,” she says.

Three tourists experienced non-serious injuries while hiking to the eruption site last week, according to the Times. And the Iceland Monitor reported that two young children developed hypothermia while hiking with their parents over the weekend.

Iceland is home to more than 30 active volcanoes, and the country sits atop two tectonic plates divided by an undersea mountain chain that releases magma, per the Times.

Before last year, the Reykjanes peninsula had gone almost 800 years without major volcanic activity, writes National Geographic’s Robin George Andrews. The eruption that broke the streak began in 2021 and lasted around six months, Heather Handley, a volcanologist and geochemist at the University of Twente in the Netherlands, writes in The Conversation.

The new eruption has about five to ten times more magma flow than last year’s. It’s unclear how long this will last but a new era of regular eruptions in the area could be underway. “This could herald the start of decades of occasional eruptions,” Dave McGarvie, a volcanologist at Lancaster University in the United Kingdom, tells National Geographic."

Forest fires that have been burning for more than two weeks in central Newfoundland could be a sign of what's to come as the province feels the impacts of climate change, a local climatologist says.

Joel Finnis, an associate professor at Memorial University, said Thursday that the conditions that enabled the wildfires in the first place could become more common as the province heats up and its climate changes.

""It's not that an event like this is impossible without climate change. It's that climate change is making this kind of event more common,"" Finnis said in an interview. ""This kind of event is a real reminder that the climate system is not waiting for us to get our act together,"" he added.

Two large forest fires have been burning since July 24 near the central Newfoundland town of Grand Falls-Windsor and the nearby Bay d'Espoir highway. The fires have intermittently shut down the highway since they first began, cutting off towns along the island's south coast from the rest of the island and closing a crucial transport route for supplies.

As of Thursday afternoon, the highway remained open as the two fires encompassed a combined area of more than 228 square kilometres. Parts of the island's south coast as well as towns in the central region, including Grand Falls-Windsor, were under a state of emergency that was first called over the weekend due to smoke and air quality concerns.

Jeff Motty, the province's forest fire duty officer, said in an interview the fires were triggered on July 24 by lightning strikes during a period of drought conditions in central Newfoundland. The lightning set off five fires in the central region, he said, and crews were able to beat back some of the flames.

""Typically, when we get fires here on the island, approximately 80 per cent are human-caused,"" he said Wednesday. ""When they're human-caused, you have the ability to get out on the site quickly and suppress them, and they don't grow that large.""

Historically, large forest fires have been more common in Labrador, according to provincial Forestry Department reports. Motty said the situation in central Newfoundland is now comparable to a fire that forced the evacuation of the western Labrador town of Wabush in 2013.

As Newfoundland's climate changes and average temperatures creep upward, rain is likely to fall less frequently, Finnis said. And when it does fall, it will likely be in shorter, higher-volume bursts.

Those long, dry stretches create fuel for forest fires, he said. And with short, intense storms, more rain is lost to run-off instead of being absorbed by the ground.

""You're just letting things dry out,"" he said. ""Litter at the bottom of the forest gets drier relatively quickly. And then you've just got a bunch of material ready to catch when a lightning strike or something else moves through.""

Finnis said he would like to see the fires trigger political commitment to curb climate change. He pointed to the recent approval of Bay du Nord, a new oil project off the coast of Newfoundland, as an example of the lack of political will and said the heat waves that swept Europe and Japan earlier this summer should serve as a warning.

""These are things are happening consistently across various parts of the world right now,"" he said. ""It's all a reminder that we've got real trouble on the horizon.""

As for the raging fires in Newfoundland, Motty said crews may soon be able to contain them so they won't get any bigger, noting that temperatures aren't expected to climb much past 25 degrees C in the coming days, if at all, and humidity is expected to be high.

""Please God, that it comes true,"" he said.

Newfoundland residents are preparing for the possibility they may have to evacuate their homes as two large forest fires continue to rage through the central parts of the province, with thick smoke forecast to cover some areas in the coming days.

Grand Falls-Windsor mayor Barry Manuel said Wednesday that the town is monitoring the situation closely for any changes over the next 24 hours as smoke is expected to roll into the city Wednesday evening.

“We ask everybody to be ready and to make sure you’re checking in on your family and loved ones and anybody that’s especially vulnerable, and have your plan in place and your things ready to go,” Barry Manuel said.

Out-of-control forest fires could cover much of Newfoundland in smoke, Environment Canada warns

Efforts under way to get food, supplies to Newfoundland towns cut off by out-of-control wildfires

Mr. Manuel said that Hunter Memorial Stadium in Deer Lake, located two hours west of Grand Falls-Windsor, is being operated by the Red Cross as a relief centre and would be available for people to evacuate to should they have nowhere else to go. Buses leave Grand Falls-Windsor daily at 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. for people who need transportation to the site.

The two current wildfires, which were sparked on July 24 by a lightning strike, have created the largest forest fire in the province since the 1960s. According to Jeff Motty, the province’s forest fire duty officer, the largest fire currently burning about 25 kilometres away from Grand Falls-Windsor in the centre of the province has grown to 170 square kilometres, while the smaller fire, which has been burning close to the Bay d’Espoir Highway, is about 58 square kilometres in size.

While the local weather appeared to clear up on Wednesday, Mr. Manuel said that the situation is “unpredictable” and encouraged residents to stay inside, especially if they are more vulnerable to smoke inhalation.

Environment Canada’s air quality health index for Grand Falls-Windsor is forecasting a “high risk” index of nine out of a possible 10+ beginning Wednesday night and continuing through Thursday. This means people should consider reducing outdoor activities, particularly if they experience a cough or breathing irritation, or have heart or breathing difficulties.

Mr. Manuel said residents should be prepared to leave at a moment’s notice and to seek up-to-date information from the provincial government’s websites and social media feeds, who will be responsible for ordering an evacuation if necessary.

“We feel confident that we’ve got all the plans in place and the logistics considered when it comes to an evacuation – that we can do that effectively. But obviously we need the co-operation of the citizens,” Mr. Manuel said.

Mr. Manuel said the fire has caused two different emergencies in the province. The first is the direct threat of smoke and flames, and the second is the risk of communities being stranded and cut off from the supply chain due to highway closures.

Closures included the Bay d’Espoir Highway, which closed Thursday afternoon and reopened Tuesday. It is the main connection to the Trans-Canada Highway and other major services and urban centres for many of the smaller communities, including Grand Falls-Windsor.

In a public advisory, the province stated that there would be a reassessment on Thursday morning to determine whether smoke is affecting visibility on the highway and whether it will remain open.

The mayor of Harbour Breton, Lloyd Blake, said Wednesday that the highway closures created a panic as people began to run out of food last week. The town of about 1,600, located along the southern coast of the province, receives weekly food shipments on Thursdays, and had to helicopter in food and essential products for residents over the last few days.

Medevac also had to be called in a few times to airlift those in need of medical care in Grand Falls-Windsor.

Now with the highway open and supplies rolling into the region, Mr. Blake is concerned about changes in the wind which could cause smoke to close the highway again.

“Our big concern was keeping that road open so emergency services and people can travel to and fro,” Mr. Blake said. About 200 visitors were stranded in the town after travelling to the region last week for the Come Home Year civic celebrations, he added.

Hermitage-Sandyville mayor Stephen Crewe said that his town, located west of Habour Breton, also had emergency supplies brought in by helicopters on Wednesday allowing local shops to restock. Although he said people now have a moment to relax, they remain vigilant as they wait to see what happens with the wind and smoke.

Community cut off by Newfoundland forest fires is running out of food, deputy mayor says

The deputy mayor of a southern Newfoundland town says his community’s food supply is running low as it remains choked off from the rest of the island because of the worst forest fires the province has seen in more than 60 years.

Roy Drake said Monday the three grocery stores in Harbour Breton, N.L., are likely to be out of food within the next day or two. Drake said he owns one of those stores – the smallest of the three in the town of about 1,600 people – and already, there’s not a jug of milk or a loaf of bread left on any of his shelves.

For the past two weeks, forest fires have forced officials to intermittently shut down a remote, 200-kilometre-long route that connects the main highway across Newfoundland with the island’s Connaigre Peninsula, which is home to the towns of Harbour Breton, Hermitage and Conne River.

In Ukraine’s Bucha, officials struggle to identify victims of war

The Kyiv suburb of Bucha has become synonymous with the worst atrocities of Russia’s war on Ukraine, and it’s only now that city officials are getting close to determining how many people died and who they were.

But even as they released a summary of the latest death toll Monday, officials said more bodies were still being found and 30 corpses had yet to be identified, reports The Globe’s Paul Waldie from Bucha. Five had been burned so badly that they couldn’t tell if they were male or female, and investigators are analyzing a collection of body parts that could result in many more confirmed deaths.

Myhailyna Skoryk, Bucha’s deputy mayor, told a news conference Monday that a total of 458 people died during the Russian occupation of the suburb, which lasted from Feb. 27 to March 31.

But establishing who was directly killed by Russian forces and who died as a consequence of the occupation has not been easy and poses a dilemma for officials trying to piece together what happened and considering the pursuit of criminal charges.

Privacy watchdog says his office learned of RCMP’s spyware use from media, calls for stronger laws

Canada’s privacy commissioner says his office learned about the RCMP’s use of spyware through the media, and he wants Parliament to strengthen and modernize privacy laws.

Philippe Dufresne appeared before a parliamentary committee that is investigating the use of technology that that can be covertly and remotely installed on computers and cellphones to monitor messages and even turn on cameras and microphones.

He told MPs Canada’s laws should be changed to include “privacy by design” and create a section in the Privacy Act that requires organizations and departments to conduct a privacy impact assessment when new technology is introduced that could affect the public’s right to privacy.

The privacy commissioner’s office was not notified when the RCMP began its assessment and Dufresne said he is not sure whether it’s complete or if he will get a copy of it when he gets a briefing later this month.

TALKING POINTS

Russia’s military is failing because of bad planning

“... The most important factor is not technological, but rather Russia’s failure to plan. Militaries that do not train and practice the way they fight will not be able to use even the most high-tech equipment effectively. A failure to engage in combined arms operations – that is, fighting in such a way that brings different military capabilities together into one efficient system – has ultimately undermined President Vladimir Putin’s goal of occupying the whole of Ukraine. If Russian officials thought their experience in Syria had provided such training, they did not anticipate the significant differences between propping up the Bashar al-Assad regime and taking over a geographically large country.” - Stephanie Carvin

Trump’s truest believers have made the former president a messiah

How dinnerware designer Amy Burstyn Fritz sets a summer table: Pieces with personality

Amy Burstyn Fritz, the co-founder of Misette, an artistic dinnerware company, comes by her love of dinnerware honestly. For Burstyn Fritz, meals at home “were special and setting the table was part of the experience.”

It’s no surprise, then, that Burstyn Fritz and her sister, Sarah Pecaut – both of whom have backgrounds in art and design – would launch a dinnerware brand with plates so pretty you can either eat off them or hang them on the wall, writes Beth Hitchcock.

Burstyn Fritz says table settings are an expression of self: “I believe you should style your table the way you’d style your outfit; it’s all about pieces with personality.”

Ottawa’s pledge to plant two billion trees is proving difficult to execute

Standing atop an old landfill, Francis Allard is in his element.

Mr. Allard is co-founder of Ramo, whose business is planting willows and poplars to help remediate landfills, mines and marginal land. At the Ste-Sophie Landfill north of Montreal, the company is growing willows to treat leachate from areas of the facility that were closed decades ago. Ramo harvests the trees every few years, weaving them into a variety of products, including fences and noise barriers. It’s also establishing a plantation in northern Quebec, to supply soil amendments for reclamation at nearby mines.

But Mr. Allard’s mood darkens back at Ramo’s new $7-million willow nursery nearby. Half of it was paid for using funding from the federal government’s 2 Billion Trees program (2BT for short). An early believer in the program, Mr. Allard scaled up Ramo’s capacity to meet the anticipated surge in demand.

He’s grateful for the support. But he’s nervously waiting for Ottawa’s response on planting projects for 2023 that Ramo proposed in February. The clock is ticking: To prepare plantations properly, he says, he’ll need to hear back by summer’s end at the latest. Read the full story by Matthew McClearn.

Wildfires shut down the highway into town, the band had to be boated in and some guests made an exit on a fishing vessel, but the Newfoundland town of Harbour Breton hosted its Come Home Year party last weekend anyway.

Jordan Tibbo, who sits on the town's recreation committee, said Wednesday it was a night for the record books.

""Despite the road being cut off, the turnout was absolutely amazing,"" Tibbo said in an interview, noting there were at least 600 people out for the show. Because of the pandemic, it was the town's first live concert since 2019, he added. ""I think people were ready to go!""

Harbour Breton is a community of about 1,600 people on Newfoundland's south coast, at the edge of the island's Connaigre Peninsula. The town hosted Come Home Year celebrations last week, including a concert featuring traditional Newfoundland band The Navigators planned for Saturday night.

The Come Home Year event invited all those who had moved away from the town over the years to return for a visit. The events are common in the province where so many young people move away for work.

But last Thursday, as growing wildfires raged nearby, provincial officials shut down the only highway leading into Harbour Breton and the Connaigre Peninsula. The road didn't open again until Tuesday morning. It remained open Wednesday as the two fires burning west of the highway grew to cover more than 200 square kilometres.

Tibbo said the road closure meant everyone already back in Harbour Breton for Come Home Year was stuck. And everyone who hadn't yet arrived had to find some other way to get there -- including the headlining band.

Enter a generous local resident with a Zodiac boat.

Arthur O'Brien, The Navigators' lead singer, guitar and fiddle player, said he and the band didn't hesitate to accept a ride on the Zodiac. They drove down the neighbouring Burin Peninsula on Saturday afternoon where the makeshift ferry awaited. After a smooth, hour-long ride, they pulled up to Harbour Breton in time for the sound check, O'Brien said an interview.

The show, he said, was great. ""For a road that was closed down in a community that not everybody was able to get to, it was near full capacity,"" O'Brien said. ""I was quite shocked.""

On Sunday morning, the band piled back into the Zodiac and returned to the Burin Peninsula. The sea wasn't quite as calm that day. ""We did some pretty good pounding,"" O'Brien said. ""One of us got sick, but I'm not saying who.""

Tibbo played in two bands that opened for The Navigators on Saturday night. One, called Top Shelf, is entirely local, he said. The other, Portside, has members from out of town. They managed to drive in before the road closed on Thursday, and they sped out of town the moment it reopened, Tibbo said.

Not wanting to wait on the highway opening, the band members' wives left town early Tuesday aboard a fishing boat, he added.

Like many of the cut-off communities on the Connaigre Peninsula, Harbour Breton began to run out of groceries as the closure dragged on. ""The joke was that they were running out of Blue Star,"" O'Brien said, referring to a popular Newfoundland beer.

He said there were several residents taking people in and out of town aboard their boats.

Officials said Wednesday morning that the two fires burning west of the Bay d'Espoir Highway covered a total area of nearly 230 square kilometres. Jeff Motty, the province's forest fire duty officer, said a day of rain Tuesday helped the situation, and water bombers were back in the air on Wednesday trying to douse the flames.

The Department of Forestry announced the highway would remain open on Wednesday, and conditions would be reassessed Thursday morning. Parts of central and southern Newfoundland remained in a state of emergency that was first declared on the weekend due largely to smoke and air quality concerns.

Late Wednesday, forestry officials advised residents of Grand Falls-Windsor, Bishop's Falls and Botwood that smoke would likely increase early Thursday morning and into Friday, and they urged people to stay indoors.

The reopening of a Newfoundland highway that had been closed for days because of raging wildfires provided hope Tuesday that much-needed supplies would finally arrive in stranded communities along the island's south coast.

Steve Crewe, mayor of Hermitage-Sandyville, said in an interview he hoped the Bay d'Espoir Highway would be open long enough for seven or eight trucks to bring groceries to communities in his area on Newfoundland's Connaigre Peninsula. The rural, wooded road is the only one connecting the region with the rest of the province, and its prolonged closure meant shelves in local stores were growing bare.

""Hopefully by suppertime tonight, we'll be in better shape,"" Crewe said Tuesday.

Officials say the forest fires in central Newfoundland began on July 24 with a lightning strike. As of Tuesday afternoon, the province's Forestry Department said the two largest fires covered an area of more than 162 square kilometres. The blazes remained out of control.

The Bay d'Espoir Highway has been plagued with intermittent closures since the fires began. Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Andrew Furey told reporters Tuesday afternoon the road ""may not be passable for long."" The reopening would allow at least some desperately needed supplies to get through, Furey said, ""hopefully for an extended period of time."" He said there was already one transport truck en route to the area.

Cooke Aquaculture has several operations on the Connaigre Peninsula, and the company said Tuesday in a news release it will use two of its large vessels to bring up to 75 pallets of food and supplies to cut-off communities in the area. The news came after two other plans to distribute food to the stranded communities had fallen through.

On Sunday, the province hatched a plan to dispatch a small ferry to the area to transport supplies and relocate stranded people. But the vessel broke down, and officials said Monday night the boat was docked in the provincial capital of St. John's.

There were also plans to send a fleet of helicopters carrying groceries and supplies to the Connaigre region on Tuesday morning. But as much-needed rain fell onto the fire area, the smoke and wind conditions made it impossible for the helicopters to make the trip, Crewe said.

""Every time we set something up, something will stop it,"" Crewe said. He cracked a joke about not knowing what people on the Connaigre Peninsula have done to deserve the string of misfortune.

Lloyd Blake, mayor of Harbour Breton, located about 50 kilometres east of Hermitage-Sandyville, said in an interview Tuesday that his town had also been counting on the helicopter deliveries. ""People are still pretty good, they're running out of bare essentials -- things like the milk, vegetables and fruits,"" Blake said.

Harbour Breton hosted a Come Home Year event over the weekend, inviting all those who had moved away from the community to come home for a visit. Blake said about 100 people remained stranded in the town as of Tuesday morning following the weekend's events.

Meanwhile, people stranded in the area and hoping to flee were lining up in the tiny town of Pool's Cove to catch a small ferry to the Burin Peninsula, where roads were open and free of fires. Pool's Cove is on the eastern side of the Connaigre Peninsula and home to about 180 people, said resident Juanita Andrews in an interview Tuesday.

She said about 100 people were lined up on the wharf on Sunday, hoping to hop on the 30-person ferry to get off the peninsula. On Monday, there were about 60 more people waiting for the boat, she said.

Andrews said she and about nine other residents have been keeping the hopeful travellers well fed with sandwiches and snacks down at the wharf -- even though Pool's Cove was also running out of groceries. She said she invited a few of them into her home on Sunday afternoon to give them a more comfortable wait for the boat.

""When there is a need in the community of Pool's Cove, we step in and we meet that need, no matter what it is or where the people are from,"" Andrews said.

Provincial officials called a state of emergency in the Connaigre Peninsula area on Saturday and in central Newfoundland towns near the fires, including Grand Falls-Windsor, located about 25 kilometres from the largest of the two fires.

Furey said Tuesday that some patients from health-care facilities in Grand Falls-Windsor, including residents of long-term care facilities, had been evacuated as a precaution, but he said emergency services at the town's hospital were still running.

""I know it's a stressful time for the citizens of central Newfoundland,"" Furey said. ""Let me tell you that you have the full force of all levels of government across Canada helping, and wanting to help, navigate through this difficult time.""

A state of emergency lasting nearly a week for parts of central Newfoundland will be lifted at midnight, the provincial government said Friday evening.

Grand Falls-Windsor, Bishop's Falls and Botwood, as well as the Coast of Bays region, were all under an evacuation alert as two distinct blazes swelled at the towns' doorsteps.

But favourable weather has allowed fire crews to turn a corner.

Special air quality statements were also lifted earlier Friday in areas affected by forest fires in central Newfoundland, as Premier Andrew Furey says the province is entering the next stage of fighting the flames.

In a video posted Thursday on Furey's social media pages, the premier said better air quality levels than initially expected have helped firefighters tackle the fires in both the Paradise Lake region and off the Bay d'Espoir Highway.

""Because of the hard-working women and men on the ground and in the air, we feel like the fire is turning a corner. This means the evacuation risk for Grand Falls-Windsor and Bishop's Falls is quite low right now,"" Furey said.

""The threat level has come down albeit, but it is still there.""

‼️ Forest Fire Update for Thursday, August 11th with Min. Bragg.<br><br>Read more: <a href=""https://t.co/MipUMeRW7c"">https://t.co/MipUMeRW7c</a> <a href=""https://t.co/3Ejx7YBIhM"">pic.twitter.com/3Ejx7YBIhM</a> —@FureyAndrew

Forest fire duty officer Jeff Motty said Friday both major fires are still deemed out of control but aren't currently growing. The Paradise Lake fire is 17,233 hectares in size, while the Bay d'Espoir Highway spans 5,614 hectares,

The size of another notable fire, at Southern Lake — north of Grand Falls-Windsor near the community of Point Leamington — also remains stable, at 283 hectares. The fire's perimeter is 20 per cent contained, Motty said.

""From the notes from last night, we never saw any growth in size on our wildfires.… So the actual perimeter or footprint of the fire is pretty much remaining stable,"" said Motty.

""[Firefighters] made a great lot of progress.… They started to get hose lines out and are starting to really move around that fire and get some work done on the perimeters of the fire.""

Water bombers like these ones will continue to be used in firefighting over the weekend. (Henrike Wilhelm/CBC)

The Bay d'Espoir Highway will remain open on Friday, the third straight day the highway has been open after it was closed earlier this week. The decision will be reassessed Saturday.

Motty said crews will continue to fight the flames on foot over the weekend on top of using helicopters and water bombers. He said firefighters are also beginning to transition away from the initial attack phase to working on hot spots and on preventive measures like fire breaks.

""It really kind of looks like we're making that transition from initial attack to more sustained action,"" Motty said.

""We're kind of like to the point where we've prevented any further growth of the fire, and now it's just kind of working to contain them. It's a sustained action or mop-up, so a lot of work to come ahead of us.""

Weather conditions will be sunny and warm with light winds in the Grand Falls-Windsor area as crews continue to fight the flames. A high temperature of around 22 C is expected with a humidex of 27, and light winds of around 10 to 20 km/h from the north.

Environment Canada meteorologist Mike Vandenberg said residents in the community could smell smoke in the air early this morning, but that will likely dissipate into the afternoon.

He's also watching the next weather system headed for the region, which could bring five to 10 millimetres of rain on Saturday night into Sunday morning.

In the video, Forestry Minister Derrick Bragg encouraged residents to remain ready should the fire situation change, as any small factor could change the threat level to the region.

""Our fire is still listed as out of control. When we saw out of control four or five days ago, there was flames in the sky,"" Bragg said.

The Department of Children, Seniors and Social Development announced Friday that the emergency shelter in Deer Lake will close as officials have decided it's no longer necessary.

People staying in the shelter will be sent to either Bishop's Falls, Grand Falls-Windsor or Botwood, but the shelter will reopen if necessary, said the department."

Smoke from two major forest fires burning in central Newfoundland won't severely affect air quality for at least the next 24 hours, the provincial Department of Public Safety said Thursday afternoon.

Although the fires are still considered out of control, the risk level from smoke is deemed low for the region and conditions now are ""trending in a positive direction,"" the department said.

Favourable early-morning weather finally allowed crews to fight the fires on the ground.

Provincial forest fire duty officer Jeff Motty says the fire burning at Paradise Lake south of Grand Falls-Windsor has seen no change in size since Wednesday's last update, while the fire burning near the Bay d'Espoir Highway has shrunk by 155 hectares. The fires span 17,233 hectares and 5,614 hectares respectively.

""Things are getting more stable,"" Motty said Thursday morning.

""I don't want to jinx myself by saying something like 'we've turned a corner' because that happened to me last week, but we are definitely seeing a change in conditions on site that is more favourable.""

The improving conditions are allowing the Bay d'Espoir Highway to remain open Thursday, but the Department of Transportation says the highway will be reassessed daily. Drivers should drive carefully, as visibility could be affected, and the department is asking people not to stop while on the road.

There is one other fire of note at Southern Lake, located north of Grand Falls-Windsor near the community of Point Leamington. That fire is around 283 hectares in size, Motty said.

A shift in the winds along with reduced smoke and less intense burning from the fires are allowing ground crews to tackle the fires on foot Thursday. Much of the firefighting so far has been accomplished by air, as conditions had been largely unsafe for firefighters to face directly.

""I believe the winds are going to be in our favour today. They're not going to be too high, so hopefully the smoke won't be a major issue for many communities that have been impacted in the past,"" Motty said.

A special air quality statement from Environment Canada remains in place for Grand Falls-Windsor and the surrounding area including Bishop's Falls and Badger.

Winds shifted from the south overnight, with officials forecasting that gusts could bring heavy smoke from the Paradise Lake fire into the region. However, Environment Canada meteorologist Mike Vandenberg said air quality has been better than initially expected.

""We haven't seen any evidence of smoke on the satellite in central, however it is pretty cloudy so it could be hiding things,"" Vandenberg said early Thursday morning.

""It seems like the air quality is much improved from what we were initially expecting … [but] if the fire changes at all through the day today, it certainly could loft a bit of smoke to Grand Falls-Windsor and that general area.""

Winds are expected to stay southerly at around 15 km/h throughout Thursday and into Friday, according to Environment Canada.

The area will see a mix of sun and cloud to go with the wind and temperature highs near 21 C. Skies will cloud over overnight, with the temperature lowering to 13 C.

Air quality statements in other central Newfoundland communities lifted Thursday morning, but Grand Falls-Windsor, Bishop's Falls and Botwood all remain in a state of emergency.

Forest fire duty officer Jeff Motty says conditions are becoming more favourable to fight the two major forest fires burning in central Newfoundland. (CBC)

Forest access roads remain closed despite the highway reopening, with Motty reminding cabin owners in the area they shouldn't be in the area to check on their properties.

""Just because it is within [the perimeter] doesn't mean your cabin is burnt. We're actually making the transition now to where we can actually get people on the ground … and get helicopters to fly those areas.""

Motty says crews hope to do structure assessments by flyover in the coming days and share details with cabin owners directly.

Meanwhile, more than 100 patients and long-term care residents moved from the region as a precaution will begin returning on Thursday and continuing into the weekend, Central Health said."

As two forest fires continue to burn through central Newfoundland, Miawpukek First Nation leaders say they're preparing for the future.

The Mi'kmaw community, also known as Conne River, is one of several towns in Newfoundland's Coast of Bays region that were cut off from essential supplies for five days when Route 360 closed because of the fires.

Miawpukek is surrounded by forest and only has one way in and out — Route 365, which branches off the Bay d'Espoir Highway. If a forest fire reached Miawpukek and the highway was closed, the community would be in danger, and residents could be left with no way out.

So Miawpukek First Nation general manager Rod Jeddore said they've made building a fire break a priority, and hope to start on it this fall.

""We at least slow it, if not stop it from coming into the community,"" he told CBC News.

For now though, the community's emergency operations centre has been focused on bringing in critical supplies like baby formula and medication.

""We weren't in any immediate danger from the fire, but our resource was cut off,"" he said. ""No fuel, no food, no basic needs were going to be met.""

Jeddore said the town was planning to use a float plane to deliver supplies, before freight trucks began arriving Tuesday.

The emergency operations centre also brought in fishing boats to help in a potential — though unlikely — evacuation.

""In the event we had to evacuate — we know full well we may not have to, but it's better to be prepared,"" he said.

Remain calm, says chief

Miawpukek resident Kimberly Hinks said the road closure and forest fires have been scary. She's nervous about going on the Bay d'Espoir highway, especially after getting on the other side for a night last week when smoke in the area was particularly strong.

Miawpukek resident Kimberly Hinks says seeing ash falling from the sky was scary. (Darrell Roberts/CBC)

""I got up and I went out that morning because there was all the smoke and that. There was so much ash over my vehicle, I was like 'holy moly,'"" she said.

Miawpukek Chief Mi'sel Joe said though the community fared relatively well overall, residents still felt anxious.

""We had to keep reminding people to stay calm,"" he said. ""We're working to this. We're doing the best we can to make sure everybody is safe.""

Chief Mi'sel Joe says the town has access to a decommissioned icebreaker in case of a need to evacuate. (Darrell Roberts/CBC)

Joe said the town also has access to a decommissioned icebreaker.

He said the community has always been concerned about the possibility of a forest fire, and will have a debriefing about its current procedures after the current situation is over.

""We certainly have to take a look at how we're going to do that and manage that,"" he said.

As the supply of necessities like baby formula, diapers and wipes dwindles, Mary Brown's Chicken is making sure some of the littlest people affected by Newfoundland's raging forest fires are being taken care of.

The restaurant chain, which first opened its doors in Newfoundland more than 50 years ago, sent a helicopter into Harbour Breton this week to restock its own location — and to help families whose supplies of baby-related needs have run low.

The Bay d'Espoir Highway — the only road connection for Harbour Breton and nearby coastal communities to the rest of Newfoundland — had been closed for five days because of one of two large forest fires on the island. It reopened Tuesday afternoon.

""On Monday we made the decision to send a helicopter down there to bring down supplies to the store, and we had some extra room on board,"" Darrell Durdle, Mary Brown's director of operations in eastern Canada, said Wednesday.

""We [had] seen that there was a huge need for diapers, baby formula, baby wipes, things like that. So we had some room, and we filled the rest of our space with some of those supplies.""

Durdle said it was important for the restaurant chain to help the community and make sure residents were taken care of, especially in a stressful situation like the forest fires.

""People of the community came together to make sure that everyone was taken care of. So it was really heartwarming to see,"" he said. ""We may be a growing national and international company now, but we always stay close to our roots and make sure that we take care of our people.""

Aquaculture company offers 2 vessels to move food

Another Atlantic Canadian company, Cooke Aquaculture in New Brunswick, is also prepared to help in the effort to deliver more supplies to the region.

Cooke has offered two vessels to the provincial government that are capable of holding 75 full pallets of groceries, according to a news release.

Joel Richardson, vice-president of public relations for Cooke Aquaculture in New Brunswick, says the company has offered Newfoundland and Labrador two vessels to deliver groceries to coastal communities. (CBC)

""The majority of issues around the road closure was around the supply to local groceries,"" Joel Richardson, Cooke's vice-president of public relations, told CBC News. He added local workers in Hermitage — located about an hour outside of Bay d'Espoir — were keen to help wherever they could.

""When there's times of crisis, we always try to offer up our equipment and resources and our people step forward.""

Richardson said the company is working with municipal governments, the Red Cross and the provincial government for support. He said the province was grateful for the helping hand.

However, shortly after the Bay d'Espoir Highway reopened, Richardson said the company got a call from the provincial government indicating the vessels wouldn't be needed after all. CBC News has contacted the Department of Transportation for clarity and its reasoning for the guidance.

Even so, Richardson said the group is ready to help wherever they can.

A state of emergency remains in place in central Newfoundland due to out-of-control forest fires, but a major highway that had been closed for days has been reopened, allowing supplies to be delivered to stranded communities.

In a release issued Tuesday evening, the provincial government said the Bay d’Espoir Highway was open, however forest resource roads along the route would remain closed and cabin owners were asked to avoid entering the area.

The province said the decision to keep the highway open will be reassessed if weather and visibility changes, with Premier Andrew Furey telling reporters Tuesday afternoon the road may not be passable for long.

A state of emergency issued over the weekend for Botwood, Bishop’s Falls, Grand Falls-Windsor and the Coast of Bays region remains in place.

1:15 Newfoundland fires: Crews still in ‘attack mode’, large amounts of smoke still loom for communities, premier says

Officials say the forest fires in central Newfoundland began on July 24 with a lightning strike.

As of Tuesday afternoon, the province’s Forestry Department said the two largest fires covered an area more than 162 square kilometres."

Smoke is affecting the ability to fight the fires and limit their spread

Smoke from forest fires burning through parts of central Newfoundland will likely start affecting the air quality in some communities starting overnight Wednesday, says the provincial government's Public Safety Department.

In a press release issued Wednesday afternoon, the department said forecasts show the wind shifting to the south, which could push smoke toward the Grand Falls-Windsor, Bishop's Falls and Botwood areas.

The department said people in those areas will likely notice a smokier atmosphere between 2 a.m. Thursday and 7 p.m. Friday — but it might not be as intense as they originally thought.

""Individuals at a higher risk of health problems or those with concerns can leave the area either on their own or by using the transportation being provided to the congregate shelter in Deer Lake,"" says the release.

The province is running four buses from central Newfoundland to a shelter in Deer Lake, taking ""any individuals impacted by the state of the emergency and deteriorating air quality.""

The department is asking other residents to keep windows and doors closed — as much as possible while maintaining a comfortable temperature — and to turn off or use recirculation settings on their heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems to keep smoke from entering their home.

Meanwhile, Newfoundland and Labrador's Department of Transportation will keep the Bay d'Espoir Highway open for at least the rest of Wednesday, as crews continue to battle forest fires in the region.

The road has been open since Tuesday afternoon, after the department closed it for five days as a result of the forest fire. Wednesday's decision isn't permanent, and officials will reassess the road Thursday morning.

The government is asking anyone travelling through the area to drive carefully and stop when necessary as smoke will limit visibility. Forest resource roads alongside the highway are still closed.

The Bay d'Espoir fire is burning on both sides of the highway, and grew slightly since Tuesday morning's update to 5,769 hectares — up 42 hectares from Tuesday.

Eight water bombers are attacking the fires Wednesday, said provincial forest fire duty officer Jeff Motty.

The other major fire, burning at Paradise Lake, has also grown — by an additional 6,800 hectares — since Tuesday morning's estimate. Motty said Wednesday the fire now spans 17,233 hectares, or about 172 square kilometres.

The fire is more than 2½ times its estimated size of 6,614 hectares on Monday morning.

Although the area received almost 20 millimetres of rain Tuesday, Motty said billowing plumes continue to play a key factor in the fire's growth.

""That one's been kicking up a lot of smoke,"" Motty said. ""Early in the incident it was causing major, major problems, and we just had to use our water bombers as effectively as we can.""

The fire is still deemed out of control as crews continue to work on the site Wednesday.

N.L. fires growing, smoke still a big threat Duration 3:07 The CBC's Heather Gillis reports on the growing fires in central Newfoundland despite rain, and fears that shifting winds will drive heavy smoke around to Grand Falls-Windsor.

""The rain certainly did help us yesterday, but we still do have a lot of work ahead of us,"" he added.

""We'll have to go and do another assessment today to see if it's safe to continue it be open, and that will always be our No. 1 operational objective with the Bay d'Espoir Highway.""

The Canadian Coast Guard, meanwhile, is transporting goods to communities on the Connaigre Peninsula by helicopter. Supplies like groceries, diapers and other common goods have run low in some areas because of the prolonged road closure.

Smoke expected to enter communities Thursday

Grand Falls-Windsor Mayor Barry Manuel is asking people to prepare for the smoke.

Special air quality statements remain in place across much of central and western Newfoundland, including Buchans, Green Bay, White Bay, the Corner Brook area and Gros Morne National Park.

""We're trying to get the messaging out today loud and clear that this is still a very serious situation and a possible risk to the community. Obviously smoke is still the main concern,"" Manuel said.

""So we've been reminding people to make sure they are fully prepared to leave at a moment's notice.""

Meteorologist Dale Foote of Environment Canada's weather office in Gander said those statements are expected to remain in place through Thursday, but residents could see some relief today before the winds change.

""Most people are getting a break from the smoke today, but by tomorrow it will be back with the southerly winds blowing up toward Grand Falls and the Bay of Exploits,"" Foote said.

Conditions will be partly cloudy with a chance of drizzle and highs around 17 C to 22 C over much of central Newfoundland Wednesday, Foote said, but the next real chance of stronger showers could be Sunday depending on how weather patterns track.

If a resident is vulnerable to smoke and poor air quality, the town is recommending people evacuate to temporary safe accommodations or the provincial government's evacuation shelter in Deer Lake, the release said.

Buses will be leaving the community from 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. NT on Wednesday from both the Joe Byrne Memorial Stadium and Windsor Stadium. Residents are asked to arrive an hour before departure and are encouraged to bring only essential items.

""If you got friends or neighbours or relatives or people who may be up in age or whatever the case may be, check in on them. That would be helpful as well,"" Manuel said.

Pets are allowed on the bus, but must be in a kettle or crate. They aren't allowed in the evacuation centre but will be cared for at the pet shelter at the Deer Lake fire hall."

Signs of the massive forest fires are few and far between on most of the drive down the Bay d'Espoir Highway into the Coast of Bays region.

There are some search and rescue vehicles, some firefighting vehicles, and about 45 minutes into the two-hour drive, a massive sections of burnt trees and charred vegetation can be seen.

For weeks now, two raging forest fires have forced the on-again, off-again closure of Route 360, the main road in and out of the area and a vital link to the rest of Newfoundland for the thousands of people living on this part of the south coast.

Tuesday night was the first time in five days travellers and trucks carrying supplies like food have been able to drive the road, and the evidence of the fires is most noticeable on the west side of the highway, where drivers can see where the fire had clearly jumped across the road.

The smell of smoke was strong, with some sections of burnt-out forest still smoking.

The sense of relief may have been stronger.

""Oh, I'm so excited. I can't wait. Can't hardly talk because I'm too excited,"" Tina Benoit told Radio-Canada.

She and her husband are two of the hundreds who have been stranded by the ongoing road closures — travellers who have been lining up near the Exploits River Motel at the entrance to the Bay d'Espoir highway for days, hoping the road will reopen.

Benoit had traveled to Gander for an appointment on Thursday and ended up stuck, unable to return home to her 13-year-old son on the south coast for five days.

As traffic flowed on both sides of Route 360 Tuesday afternoon, provincial forestry officials and search and rescue volunteers warned people not to stop on the highway or try to access their cabins.

A long five days

The relief is just as prominent at the other end of the road. In St. Alban's, one of dozens of communities cut off from the critical supply route, Mayor Connie Willcott said it's been a long five days.

""With each passing day the anxiety was definitely growing,"" she said.

Stores have been running out of supplies, and gas was only available for emergency services.

""All of those things were making us very worried,"" she said.

St. Alban's Deputy Mayor Connie Willcott says the reopening of Route 360 is a huge relief for residents. (Darrell Roberts/CBC)

Willcott said residents worried about missing medical appointments and what would happen in a medical emergency.

And even though the road has reopened for now, Willcott said the town isn't letting its guard down.

""This can change at any given moment,"" she said. ""The winds are unpredictable, or, I guess, changing at any given time. So we're just holding tight and staying here and being here for our residents.""

The provincial government had been preparing to bring supplies to the community by helicopter, and Willcott said that plan is still in place if the road closes again. She said the town's emergency centre is still actively meeting.

'Keep your fingers crossed'

Jennifer Collier, manager of St. Alban's Clover Farms, said the store hadn't received any supplies for a week — though she was hopeful that would soon change.

Shelves normally filled with produce, breads and meat were empty on Tuesday night. The store was also running low on baby products and pet food.

""Our produce, our fresh meat, our milk, bread, everything like that is really, extremely low,"" she said. ""We really need freight.""

St. Alban's Clover Farm manager Jennifer Collier says customers have been increasingly anxious as the closure continued. (Darrell Roberts/CBC)

Collier said the store hadn't been prepared for the sudden closure of its supply route, and had been forced to put purchase limits on some goods in order to curb panic buying. She said the isolation created an uneasy feeling in the community.

""They've been a little bit anxious, panicked a little bit, hey? Because we don't know when the highway was going to reopen.""

A Central Dairy supply truck had brought more milk on Tuesday afternoon, and Collier said a refrigerated truck with some supplies — though not a full order — was en route on Tuesday night. She was hopeful supplies would be delivered to the store early Wednesday morning.

Though the road reopened on Tuesday, Collier said residents still feel anxious about what could happen next.

""We've been told that could change at any time. So we're isolated, we have no way to get any food in, so it was a little bit of panic."""

Charlotte Foster was camping on Saturday when she got the news her town, Grand Falls-Windsor, was under a state of emergency.

""I came straight home to pack everything just in case, 'cause you never know if the wind can turn,"" Foster said Monday.

Two forest fires have been burning out of control near Bishop's Falls and Grand Falls-Windsor for weeks now. The fires intensified over the weekend, in part due to hot, dry, windy conditions — and also the unpredictability of fire behaviour.

It's that uncertain situation Foster calls nerve-racking.

""A lot of anxiety. A lot of anxiety,"" she said. ""At the same time, we gotta keep calm and all of it, right? Hopefully it will all work out,"" she said.

The Newfoundland and Labrador government declared a state of emergency for Bishop's Falls, Grand Falls-Windsor and the Connaigre Peninsula on Saturday, and added the town of Botwood on Sunday.

'It's super scary'

Madison Antle, who lives in Bishop's Falls, said she's had conversations with friends and family about where to go if they have to flee. If an evacuation order comes, she'll head to the island's East Coat to stay with friends.

""The winds are changing all the time, so people are really, like, on their toes and they don't know what to expect,"" she said. ""It's super scary.""

Darrell Roberts/CBC

Antle is moving to Toronto for school this fall, but said she's ready to leave earlier if necessary.

Alan Noftall of Grand Falls-Windsor said the situation began to feel real after he watched Premier Andrew Furey's state of emergency announcement Saturday night. Furey described the fires as the worst the province has seen since 1961, and said an evacuation order wasn't imminent, but people should be ready to go at a moment's notice.

Noftall said people in Grand Falls-Windsor are nervous.

""I think people are in disbelief,"" he said. ""We've had fires near the community before, but nothing this major.""

Darrell Roberts/CBC

Noftall said he's packed, and knows where he'll go if he has to leave. ""As they say: 'go west, young man.'""

'Pretty good shape'

In Bishop's Falls, Bill Milley said the community is doing relatively well, and is coming together to help. He's a member of the local Lions Club, which has been working to raise money and help travellers stranded by the ongoing Bay d'Espoir Highway closure.

The road, a vital link to the Coast of Bays area, was closed for a fourth straight day on Monday, with officials warning a pair of fires near the highway and Paradise Lake had grown — though they didn't merge, as was feared over the weekend. Central Health moved some patients and long-term care residents over the weekend due to the heavy smoke, which also hindered efforts to fight the fire.

But there was some good news for the area Monday — Environment Canada lifted its air quality warning as winds shifted, blowing smoke away from the towns. There's also a small amount of rain forecasted for Tuesday.

""We're just blessed, I guess,"" Milley said. ""Someone's looking out for us — and it ain't me.""

Milley said he can be ready to leave at a moment's notice, but he's hoping it won't come to that.

""We don't feel any threat here in Bishop's whatsoever with regards to the fire. Just the smoke's the problem,"" he said.

Milley said he's hopeful the tide will turn on the firefighting, and the communities can get back to normal.

""I think we're in pretty good shape right now, and I can only see it improving in the next couple of days.""

Help on the Way for Central Newfoundland Fire That Premier Says Is Largest Since 1961

The rapid growth of a long-burning forest fire in central Newfoundland has triggered a state of emergency in the area and the expansion of an outdoor fire ban to the entire province.

Premier Andrew Furey told reporters on Sunday the state of emergency was declared the night before in the areas of Grand Falls-Windsor, Bishop’s Falls and the Connaigre Peninsula, “not to create panic” but to ensure residents and officials alike are ready to respond if the situation deteriorates further. The state of emergency was also extended to the area of Botwood on Sunday afternoon.

“Over the last 36 hours, things have changed,” Furey said at a news conference, alongside Fisheries, Forestry and Agriculture Minister Derrick Bragg and Department of Natural Resources Incident Commander Craig Coady.

“We were predicting that we could manage this. However … with the wind change, we are afraid that there will be significant smoke impact.”

“This is a precautionary measure, and there is no immediate fire hazard to homes or residents,” the province said in a statement.

Furey said the current predictive path of the blaze itself does not directly impact any communities, but changing wind patterns were making the situation difficult to handle.

He said that prompted him to ask Public Safety Minister John Hogan to declare a state of emergency, and urged some nearby communities to prepare for possible evacuation.

“This is a dynamic, evolving situation as all fires are, but we can’t wait for the last minute … we have to act now,” Furey said.

The fire has been burning for close to two weeks in central Newfoundland and has prompted road closures, including the Bay d’Espoir Highway, which is the only road connecting the communities of Harbour Breton, Hermitage and Conne River to the Trans-Canada Highway, the main thoroughfare across the province.

Coady said the wildfires will most likely continue to burn out of control due to the weather conditions.

“Over the past couple days, we’ve seen some extreme fire behaviour,” he said at the news conference. “We expect to see that continue for today and possibly for the next few days. This is due to the high winds and low humidity.”

Coady and Furey both said smoke posed the most significant risk for nearby communities, adding winds were also making it difficult for firefighters to control the blazes.

“If the (water) bombers can’t see ahead of the fire and it’s too smoky, it’s not safe for them to operate,” Coady said.

In all, the province is using water bombers—two from Quebec, in addition to the province assisting with a bird dog aircraft—and helicopters to fight the fires.

In a video posted to social media Saturday night, Furey described one blaze as the largest the province has seen since 1961. As of Sunday, the provincial government reported four active fires which covered about 10,800 hectares.

Jeff Motty, the Forestry Department’s provincial duty officer, said the department hopes to change the fire status near Southern Lake Access Road, which started on July 31, before the end of the weekend.

“We are working really hard on it, we got a lot of resources,” Motty said in an interview Sunday. “We probably won’t extinguish it but we will take a good crack of it.”

Federal Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair tweeted he had approved Newfoundland’s request for government assistance, and Canadian Armed Forces personnel would be deployed to help provincial and municipal officials with evacuation efforts.

Furey said he has asked the Central Health region to create an evacuation plan for hospitals, long-term care homes, and personal care homes.

In a statement on Sunday, however, Newfoundland’s government said Central Health will not undertake measures to evacuate the Dr. Hugh Twomey Health Care Centre at this time.

“Efforts will be supported to move those who require additional care so that they are not in the immediate vicinity of the smoke,” the release said.

Alexandra Catherine, a resident of Grand Falls, said the thought of leaving her home and most of her possessions behind has been terrifying.

“We packed everything up last night, clothing and some personal items that can’t be replaced,” Catherine said in an interview on Facebook Messenger.

“I’m not taking any chance with two small children at home … we will be leaving and heading west.”

Vicktoria A. Prowse-Hunter, another Grand Falls resident, echoed Catherine’s plan.

“I have my bags packed, ready to leave when we get the order to do so,” Prowse-Hunter said in an interview on Facebook Messenger.

Prowse-Hunter said she was awakened by smoke the morning after the fire started.

“It was a warm night so I had all my windows open and I woke up at 7 a.m. coughing uncontrollably,” she said. “Then I kind of knew that it was serious.”

The Department of Fisheries, Forestry and Agriculture tweeted Sunday morning that the Canadian Red Cross and Salvation Army will deliver emergency services for those who are stranded on the Trans-Canada Highway as a result of the Bay d’Espoir Highway closure.

It said in a statement the Canadian Red Cross relocated shelter services and resources from Grand Falls-Windsor to Deer Lake “for individuals who may be impacted by the state of emergency.”

Meanwhile, Bragg pleaded for residents to be “fire smart.”

The department said the outdoor fire ban, which was expanded provincewide on Sunday, prohibits the setting of fires on or within 300 metres of forestland.

“Last night I saw two people throwing cigarette butts and I thought that was absolutely crazy,” Bragg said. “That is reckless and we do not need it.”

“You can have your BBQ … but do not, and I can’t say that strong enough, if you are out in a wooded area, do not have any sort of open fire.”

f2806373-6cce-484d-bee7-fbd26be98157,"Bags packed and waiting beside their front door, Krista and Pat Morgan are nervously watching a blazing menace creep toward them.

“There’s a major raging forest fire not very far from us, and it’s headed toward us,” says Krista. “I’m just trying to stay calm, though. Trying to not let it worry us too much, or anybody else around us.”

The smoke from the Bay d’Espoir Highway fire, about 20 kilometres to the southwest has, for the past three days, been blanketing Bishop’s Falls, N.L., where they live. On Sunday, Morgan said, it was almost intolerable.

The province, battling uncontrolled wildfires for the past two weeks — the worst forest fires it has seen in more than 60 years — has declared a state of emergency for the entire region, and residents of Bishop’s Falls, as well as nearby communities, have been told to prepare for a mandatory evacuation on 24-hour notice.

Voluntary evacuations have already begun; the province has been running buses twice a day from a nearby Salvation Army church to a shelter run by the Red Cross at Deer Lake, 230 kilometres to the west.

Krista and Pat are staying put for the time being, but they are cautiously monitoring the fire burning to the southwest. If it gets within 10 kilometres of town, they say, they won’t wait for the evacuation order; they’ll pack those bags by the door into the car and head west, out of the danger zone, toward Deer Lake or Corner Brook.

“The winds here, they turn so quickly and so fast, and nobody can predict what Mother Nature has in store for us,” Krista said.

The couple, who between them own a number of businesses in Bishop’s Falls, worry about what would happen if that fire swept through their town.

“I have a good friend in Kamloops, B.C., who goes through this every summer. I’ve been kind of living it vicariously through him for the last few years.

“We’re definitely worried about it. Everything we’ve ever worked for is here.

“But at the same time, it’s all material things. Nothing that can’t be rebuilt. It would suck if we lost these ones, but that’s the world we live in, right? Our turn.”

In the southern Newfoundland town of Harbour Breton, deputy mayor Roy Drake says his community, cut off by the fires, is running out of food.

Roy Drake said Monday he figures the three grocery stores in town will be out of food within the next day or two. Drake said he owns one of those stores — the smallest of the three in the town of about 1,600 people — and already, there’s not a jug of milk or a loaf of bread left on any of his shelves.

“Things are starting to get stressful for most residents,” Drake said in a phone interview from the town hall. “We need to get food in within a day or so to help us out. Not just for Harbour Breton, but for the entire region.”

For the past two weeks, forest fires have forced officials to intermittently shut down a remote, 200-kilometre-long route that connects the main highway across Newfoundland with the island’s Connaigre Peninsula, which is home to the towns of Harbour Breton, Hermitage and Conne River. The last time the road was opened was last Thursday morning, according to the Department of Forestry’s regular Twitter updates.

The province has declared a state of emergency stretching from the Connaigre Peninsula up the highway to the towns of Bishop’s Falls, Grand Falls-Windsor and Botwood, largely because of smoke and air-quality concerns.

In a video posted to social media Saturday night, Premier Andrew Furey described one blaze as the largest the province has seen since 1961. As of Sunday, the provincial government reported four active fires covering about 10,800 hectares.

The Canadian Red Cross has set up emergency shelter for those stranded north of the fires in central Newfoundland, and Quebec has sent firefighters and aircraft to help battle the flames.

For those stranded south of the fires on the Connaigre Peninsula, the provincial Transportation Department has enlisted a ferry to start bringing supplies to stranded communities and to help people leave.

The ferry is expected to arrive Tuesday. The timing will be tight, Drake said, noting that the ferry will be docking in the neighbouring town of Hermitage, which needs its own supplies and which is still about 50 kilometres away from his community.

“I’m not sure that ferry is going to be able to accommodate what we may need in terms of supply on Day 1,” he said, adding that he’d be focused on sorting out how and when the needed supplies might arrive in his town.

David Neil, a warning preparedness meteorologist for Environment and Climate Change Canada, said the fires were started on July 24 by a lightning strike, in the midst of an abnormally warm and dry summer.

“This is a very unique situation,” he said, though he was hesitant to pin it directly on the province’s changing climate.

Neil said there are about 10 millimetres of rain forecast for the area Tuesday.

“It’s not a great deal of rain,” he admitted. “But at the very least, it should bring some help to the folk trying to contain the fire.”

b74f408d-965e-458d-a593-b6d74f28d2d2,"Maine’s back-to-back swelters in recent weeks may be a consequence of the warming Gulf of Maine.

Derek Schroeter, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Gray, told Maine Public that the warmer surface temperature in the gulf is a source for humidity.

That’s contributing not only to hot daytime highs, but also to more frequent nights when temperatures don’t fall below 70 degrees Fahrenheit, offering Mainers little relief from the swelter.

“The low temperature [in 2020] didn’t drop below 70 degrees for nine days during the summer. And so usually what that means is, you know, most people are resorting to running their air conditioners at night, as opposed to being able to open up the windows to cool off the house. And a lot of that can be attributed to the Gulf of Maine sea surface temperatures have actually been running well above normal,” Schroeter said.

The Gulf of Maine has been warming faster than most of the world’s oceans, with 2021 being the hottest year on record for the body of water. A new study, published in the journal Communications Earth and Environment, led by Massachusetts-based Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, co-written by the University of Maine and funded by the National Science Foundation, found that the past century of warming has reversed nearly 900 years of cooling in the Gulf of Maine.

Portland saw temperatures rise to 96 degrees on Sunday, surpassing the previous record of 93 degrees for Aug. 7 set in 2001 and then later tied in 2018.

Bangor saw temperatures rise to 92 degrees on Sunday, the eighth day so far this year when the mercury surged into the 90s.

The weather service station in Caribou tied its record high for Aug. 7 when temperatures hit 89 degrees. It was the 28th day so far this year when temperatures rose above 80 degrees in Caribou.

In Portland, extreme heat has become more common in recent decades, making the city a veritable heat island. In the previous decade, Portland experienced 32 days of extreme heat (defined as a day with a heat index above 90 degrees), compared with six days in the 2000s, nine in the 1990s and three in the 1980s.

That warming trend is likely to continue as the temperatures rise in the Gulf of Maine, Schroeter told Maine Public."

In an effort to chronicle changing water temperatures in the Gulf of Maine, researchers assessed data collected from shells and simulated variability through climate models.

They found that following a prolonged period of cooling, climate change has contributed to rising temperatures in the region.

These increased temperatures have already taken a toll on local marine life and will likely worsen in the future.

Using data from shells in the western Gulf of Maine along with other proxies for water properties, researchers revealed global warming has been reversing a thousand-year cooling process in the region since the late 1800s.

According to authors, this is likely due to increased atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and changes in western North Atlantic water dynamics. Findings were published in Communications Earth and Environment.

Climate model simulations also show “warming over the last century was more rapid than almost any other 100-year period in the last 1,000 years in the region.”

Extreme marine sea surface temperature (SST) heat waves have been documented in the Gulf of Maine in recent years and have taken a toll on the region’s ecosystems, including certain whales, fish and lobster.

However, little is known about temperature variability or water properties prior to the installment of the Boothbay Harbor (BBH) SST, dating back to 1905. To address this knowledge gap, researchers set out to construct a 300-year data set chronicling hydrographic variability in the Gulf of Maine.

Three sources of chemical proxies were used to assess water changes including shells, oxygen isotopes (to measure temperature and salinity) and nitrogen isotopes (to measure water mass source).

Prior to the documented warming, the region was consistently cooling for many years thanks to volcanic forcings, researchers said. The cooling followed by rapid warming detected in the study is consistent with the Community Earth System Model-Last Millennium Ensemble (CESM-LME), which shows reconstructions of external forcings, like greenhouse gas or solar variability, over the last millennium.

The CESM-LME Northern Hemisphere surface temperature simulations also detail the impact of volcanic forcings prior to 1850 and greenhouse gas and aerosol forcings after 1850, authors said.

In addition, the position of the gulf stream, which helps dictate what proportion of slope water enters the Gulf of Maine, also plays a large role in dictating temperatures.

Future projections of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations along with a projected weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation indicate warming in this region will likely continue, “leading to continued and potentially worsening ecologically and economically devastating temperature increases in the region in the future,” authors concluded.

75d905e5-272d-4216-8afe-34b8612b4e0e,"Everyone knows rats, bats, mold and mosquitoes can make people sick, but a new study out this week concludes such pathogens and hundreds more are made worse by the warming world.

A group of University of Hawaii researchers put together a list of 376 human diseases and allergens, then looked at how they're affected by climate-related weather hazards, such as heat waves, flood, drought, fire and rain.

They found nearly 60% of the known pathogens that make people sick have been aggravated by warming-related weather hazards, according to the study published this week in Nature Climate Change. The list included not only mosquito-borne viruses like malaria and dengue fever but also asthma, monkeypox, shellfish poisoning and even fungal infections like valley fever.

The researchers reviewed more than 70,000 academic studies and papers to search for links between the pathogens and 10 climate-related weather hazards.

“The results were truly sobering,” said Erik Franklin, assistant professor at the university's Hawai'i Institute of Marine Biology and a study co-author.

Climate hazards are bringing pathogens and people closer together, strengthening the pathogens and impairing people, Franklin said. “This is a massive vulnerability for human health care systems.”

Heat waves increasing:Extreme heat waves may be our new normal, thanks to climate change. Is the globe prepared?

Pathways to disease

Even after sounding warnings about the consequences of climate change on human health for more than 25 years, Jonathan Patz, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Nelson Institute, was still surprised at the many ways researchers found climate hazards affect disease.

“They found over 1,000 unique pathways,"" said Patz, also a co-author of the study. ""That to me was striking.”

The pathways included things like flood-transmitted disease and mosquitoes that thrive in heavy rainfall, spreading malaria and other diseases. Warming, rainfall and flooding were the three most frequent pathways pathogens could be transmitted to people.

Invasive species cost billions:As the climate warms, the damage is expected to get worse.

What do the findings mean?

“It just amplifies the key message that the climate crisis is a human health crisis,” Patz said. “When we’re talking about 58% of all infections and other human pathogenic diseases being affected by climate, it demands that we shift our attention away from thinking about every single disease and vaccine.""

The study reveals “worrisome glimpses” into the possible consequences of health crises in the future and points to an “urgent need” to reduce fossil fuel emissions that cause the planet to warm, Franklin and others said.

“There are just too many diseases and pathways of transmission for us to think that we can truly adapt to climate change,"" said co-author Camilo Mora, geography professor in the University of Hawaii's College of Social Sciences. ""It highlights the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally.”

Were any of the diseases diminished by climate hazards?

The study found 63 pathogens had been diminished at some point by climactic hazards, such as cases in which warming reduced the spread of viral diseases. All but nine of those had also been aggravated at some point by climate, however.

The authors cautioned that their work could reflect a bias, based on what the authors published in Google Scholar chose to study. For example, researchers may be doing more studies about diseases aggravated by the changing climate or fewer studies about diseases less concerning because of climate change.

Have other recent studies looked at the effect of warming on pathogens?

Yes. More than a half-dozen studies this year, including two this week, have pointed out the rising risk of disease transmission in a warming world.

Another study out this week, led by Mia Maltz, a microbial ecologist at the University of California, Riverside, found higher concentrations of dust carrying toxins from around the world are landing at lower elevations in the Sierra Nevada mountains. The study also concluded increasing droughts could spread more pathogens in dust.

“Pathogenic dust is becoming more of a threat as the Earth gets drier and more parched,"" Maltz said.

A study in April co-written by Colin Carlson, a global change biologist and assistant research professor at Georgetown University, and a group of collaborators found that changes in climate and land use could bring previously isolated wildlife species – and their pathogens – into new areas.

Carlson and others also have documented rapid range shifts in African anopheles mosquitoes over the past century. The researchers question the role climate change might have played and suggested it's an important topic for future research.

A co-author on another study, Dr. Aaron Bernstein, interim director of the Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment at Harvard School of Public Health, told The Associated Press the Hawaii study is a good warning as warming and habitat loss push animals and their diseases closer to people.

“This study underscores how climate change may load the dice to favor unwelcome infectious surprises,” Bernstein told the AP in an email. “But of course it only reports on what we already know, and what’s yet unknown about pathogens may be yet more compelling about how preventing further climate change may prevent future disasters like COVID-19.”

What happens next?

The University of Hawaii researchers put together an elaborate interactive website others can use to see the links between climate-related hazards and pathogens.

""We're hoping it's a much more useful tool,"" Franklin said. ""We're hoping it will be a resource for health care practitioners to use in their own work.""

fb63e04c-3a56-464d-af70-bd8ce3ffddf9,"As global temperatures have risen in recent decades, so have the number of outbreaks of infectious diseases. SARS, MERS, Zika, West Nile, COVID-19, and now clusters of monkeypox and polio have all recently threatened public health.

That’s no coincidence. In a study published in August in Nature Climate Change, researchers tried to understand the relationship between major environmental changes related to higher greenhouse gas emissions—including global warming, rising sea levels, storms, floods, drought, and heat waves—and the outbreaks of 375 human infectious diseases caused by viruses, bacteria, and other pathogens. They found that 58% of these public-health threats were fueled by climate change.

“The health impacts of climate change are here,” says Dr. Vishnu Laalitha Surapaneni, assistant professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota. “And they are affecting us right here, right now.”

Viruses and other pathogens aren’t becoming better at living in higher environmental temperatures, scientists say. Instead, it’s more likely that the host animals they infect are affected by changing climates. Increasing global temperatures, for example, mean that the geographic range for many pathogen-carrying animals—including insects like mosquitoes—is expanding rapidly. “As they move around to find better climates, there are more opportunities for viruses to spill over among other mammals, and then from some of those mammals to humans,” says Gigi Gronvall, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security at the Bloomberg School of Public Health. In the same way that highways, planes, and trains connect remote parts of the world, these animals are transporting their microbial payloads into new places.

Tickborne diseases are one example of climate’s impact on human health. With warming temperatures, the habitable environment for ticks is stretching further north, into Canada and even Nova Scotia. Neither place had reported cases of Lyme disease, which is carried by ticks, until 2002.

Warming ocean waters are also allowing dangerous pathogens to thrive, including flesh-eating bacteria from the vibrio genus. Infections from these bacteria have recently increased—not only when natural climate disasters such as hurricanes sweep over land and bring contaminated waters in closer contact to people, but also when people with exposed cuts or wounds venture into oceans, which have become fertile waters for bacterial growth. In a report published by the Lancet in 2021, a group of health and climate experts from 43 academic institutes and U.N. agencies analyzed metrics of environmental impact on human health, including the role of pathogens. The amount of coastline in which vibrio now thrive has increased by 25% in the U.S. northeast and by 4% in the Pacific northwest.

With global warming, mosquitoes are also encroaching further north than they have ever ventured before. Diseases they carry, such as dengue, have been reported far outside of their typical tropical areas in places like New York City—and disturbingly, the cases aren’t always from travelers, but often from infected mosquitoes circulating in the region. Other pathogens these insects transport, including the ones responsible for Zika and yellow fever, are also being reported in parts of the world where they haven’t previously been common. The Lancet report showed that in some lower income countries in which mosquitoes are known to thrive, the period of time during which the insects are now active has increased 39% between 1950-1959 and 2010-2019.

While mosquitoes generally thrive in wetter, humid climes, hotter temperatures resulting in droughts may also promote certain mosquito-borne illnesses, such as West Nile disease. Under drier drought conditions, birds—one of the animal vectors for mosquitoes—tend to congregate in the scarce areas where water is available, creating the ideal conditions for mosquitoes to find new hosts.

Bats, too, are expanding into new territories as they respond to the stress of climate change. Warming temperatures send them searching for more preferable climes, and their increased movement raises the chances of interacting with people and spreading diseases, such as coronaviruses. “There is a lot more mixing of populations of animals that haven’t been mixed before,” says Gronvall.

Understanding these shifting behaviors and changing habitats requires appreciating that the health of one species is intimately tied to the health of all species. Scientists say devoting more resources to understanding how viruses, bacteria, and other pathogens circulate among different animal species is crucial in order to better understand how their behaviors can impact human health. “It’s really hard to build bridges between different communities,” such as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Environmental Protection Agency or the Department of Agriculture, Gronvall says. “But we are going to need a much more integrated approach to tackling research questions that everyone agrees are important.”

In 2016, a community in a remote corner of northern Siberia started to get sick.

Dozens of people, and thousands of reindeer, had developed anthrax, a bacterial disease that can cause fever, swelling and vomiting. One child died, as well as at least 2,000 reindeer.

The cause is believed to be the climate crisis.

Scientists think that extraordinarily high temperatures that summer thawed out a frozen reindeer carcass that died from anthrax decades before – releasing dormant spores back into the air with tragic consequences.

It’s not the only time the climate crisis may have gotten people sick. A new study found that 58 per cent of human infectious diseases have been helped along by climate-related disasters, from bacteria like anthrax to viruses like Zika and parasites like malaria.

The results highlight some of the secondary consequences of climate disasters as floods, storms and droughts push people into contact with disease.

The sheer magnitude of the potential climate impact on disease means this problem may only be fixed by attacking it at the source, study author Camilo Mora, a geographer at the University of Hawaii-Manoa, tells The Independent.

“We need to forget about the idea of adapting to climate change,” Dr Mora says. “We need to move right away to reduce emission of greenhouse gases.”

To do this research, the team gathered information from hundreds of research papers that documented the connection between a climate hazard and a disease. They noted all the different ways that floods, warming and storms, for example, were connected to different pathogens.

Results were published on Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change.

Some connections between climate and disease are rather straightforward. For example, flooding can lead to cases of leptospirosis, a bacterial disease, contracted when people wade through infected waters.

But flooding can also lead to long-term standing water, which provides fertile habitat for mosquitoes and spurs associated diseases like dengue, chikungunya and malaria.

Some disease pathways are more indirect but still related to the climate crisis.

For example, after a disaster hits a community, the subsequent lack of access to adequate healthcare could increase the spread of venereal diseases like gonorrhoea, the study authors note.

In addition, some scientists believe that heatwaves could make viruses more adaptive to high temperatures, and thus less susceptible to the body’s fever response, the authors note.

A diagram of different hazards that stem from the plentary warming powered by greenhouse gas (Mora et al 2022)

The connection between the climate crisis and disease wasn’t entirely one-sided — the study found that 16 per cent of human infectious diseases could be alleviated by climate impacts. After a drought, for instance, there might be fewer pools of standing water, meaning less malaria.

But the reverse is also true. With malaria, for example, drought can also lead to higher mosquito density in the water pools that remain, the authors point out.

Dr Mora says he was surprised by the sheer number of ways that climate hazards have influenced human diseases. The paper found that there are over 1,000 ways that the climate crisis could aggravate infectious diseases — which the authors have visualized in an interactive website.

That exhausting list is why he says we need to focus on the source problem: stopping greenhouse gas emissions.

“I’m telling you there is no such thing as adapting to climate change,” Dr Mora says. “When you have 1,000 different ways that you’ve got to protect yourself with climate change, forget about adaptation.”

He added: “We’re playing with fire. Do you want to play with fire? Go ahead and do all the climate change that you want,”

“But if there is a conclusion to be made from this, it’s that this is not something that we want to be messing with.”"
2164bb16-8c6e-4b10-aef5-a867573d75b7,"An extensive new study shows that climate change can aggravate over half of known human pathogenic diseases. This comprehensive systematic review of the literature narrowed down 3213 cases, linking 286 infectious diseases to specific climate change hazards. Of these, 58% were worsened, and only 9 conditions showed any benefit associated with environmental change.

The study was published online today in Nature Climate Change. The complete list of cases, transmission pathways, and associated papers can be explored in detail — a remarkable, interactive data visualization.

To compile the data, investigators searched 10 keywords on GIDEON (Global Infectious Disease and Epidemiology Network) and CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) databases. They then filled gaps by examining alternative names of the diseases, pathogens, and hazards.

Dr Tristan McKenzie

Co-author Tristan McKenzie, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden, told Medscape Medical News: ""If someone is interested in a certain pathway, it's a beautiful starting point."" Or if someone wants to ""do a modeling study and they want to focus on a specific area, the specific examples in the literature are already there"" in the extensive database.

An early key finding is that warming and increased precipitation broadened the range of many pathogens through expansion of their habitat. This shift brings many pathogens closer to people. We have already seen vectors such as mosquitoes, ticks, fleas, birds, and several mammals spreading infections over a broader range. Examples are viruses (dengue, Chikungunya), bacteria (Lyme), protozoans (trypanosomes), and more. Warming has affected aquatic systems (eg, Vibrio) and higher altitudes and latitudes (malaria, dengue).

Pathogenic hazards are not just moving closer to people. People are also moving closer to the pathogenic hazards, with heat waves causing people to seek refuge with water activities, for example. This increases their exposure to pathogens, such as Vibrio, hepatitis, and water-borne gastroenteritis.

Some hazards, such as warming, can even make pathogens more virulent. Heat can upregulate Vibrio's gene expression of proteins affecting transmission, adhesion, penetration, and host injury.

Heat and rainfall can increase stagnant water, enhancing mosquitoes' breeding and growing grounds and enabling them to transmit many more infections.

People's capacity to respond to climate hazards can also be impaired. For example, there is a reduced concentration of nutrients in crops under high CO 2 levels, which can result in malnutrition. Lower crop yields can further fuel outbreaks of measles, cholera, or Cryptosporidium. Drought also likely forces people to drink contaminated water.

Among all this bad news, the authors found a small number of cases where climate hazards reduced the risk of infection. For example, droughts reduced the breeding grounds of mosquitoes, reducing the prevalence of malaria and chikungunya. But in other cases, the density of mosquitoes increased in some pools, causing an increased local risk of infection.

Naomi Hauser, MD, MPH, assistant clinical professor at UC Davis in Sacramento, California, told Medscape Medical News she was particularly impressed with the data visualization. ""It really emphasizes the magnitude of what we're dealing with. It makes you feel the weight of what they're trying to represent,"" she said.

On the other hand, Hauser said she would have liked ""more emphasis on how the climate hazards interact with each other. It sort of made it sound like each of these climate hazards is in a vacuum — like when there's floods, and that's the problem. But there are a lot of other things…like when we have warming and surface water temperature changes, it can also change the pH of the water and the salinity of the water, and those can also impact what we see with pathogens in the water.""

McKenzie explained one limitation: the study looked only at 10 keywords. So an example of a dust storm in Africa causing an increase in Vibrio in the US could not be identified by this approach. ""This also goes back to the scale of the problem, because we have something going on in the Sahara that's impacting the East Coast of the US,"" he said. ""And finding that link is not necessarily obvious — or at least not as obvious as [if] there was a hurricane and a bunch of people got sick from waterborne disease. So I think that really highlights the scale of this problem.""

Instead of looking at only one individual or group of pathogens, the study provided a much broader review of infections caused by an array of climate hazards. As McKenzie said, ""No one's actually done the work previously to really just try and get a comprehensive picture of what we might be dealing with. And so that was the goal for us."" The 58% estimate of diseases worsened by climate change is conservative, and, he says, ""Arguably, this is an even bigger problem than what we present.""

McKenzie concluded: ""If we're looking at the spread of some more serious or rare diseases in areas, to me then the answer is…we need to be aggressively mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. Let's start with the source.""

McKenzie and Hauser report no relevant financial relationships.

0beabe93-a93c-4522-8dea-a34579d02e16,"Climate hazards such as flooding, heat waves and drought have worsened more than half of the hundreds of known infectious diseases in people, including malaria, hantavirus, cholera and anthrax, a study says.

Researchers looked through the medical literature of established cases of illnesses and found that 218 out of the known 375 human infectious diseases, or 58%, seemed to be made worse by one of 10 types of extreme weather connected to climate change, according to a study in Monday’s journal Nature Climate Change.

The study mapped out 1,006 pathways from the climate hazards to sick people. In some cases, downpours and flooding sicken people through disease-carrying mosquitos, rats and deer. There are warming oceans and heat waves that taint seafood and other things we eat and droughts that bring bats carrying viral infections to people.

Doctors, going back to Hippocrates, have long connected disease to weather, but this study shows how widespread the influence of climate is on human health.

“If climate is changing, the risk of these diseases are changing,” said study co-author Dr. Jonathan Patz, director of the Global Health Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Doctors, such as Patz, said they need to think of the diseases as symptoms of a sick Earth.

“The findings of this study are terrifying and illustrate well the enormous consequences of climate change on human pathogens,” said Dr. Carlos del Rio, an Emory University infectious disease specialist, who was not part of the study. “Those of us in infectious diseases and microbiology need to make climate change one of our priorities, and we need to all work together to prevent what will be without doubt a catastrophe as a result of climate change.”

In addition to looking at infectious diseases, the researchers expanded their search to look at all type of human illnesses, including non-infectious sicknesses such as asthma, allergies and even animal bites to see how many maladies they could connect to climate hazards in some way, including infectious diseases. They found a total of 286 unique sicknesses and of those 223 of them seemed to be worsened by climate hazards, nine were diminished by climate hazards and 54 had cases of both aggravated and minimized, the study found.

The new study doesn’t do the calculations to attribute specific disease changes, odds or magnitude to climate change, but finds cases where extreme weather was a likely factor among many.

Study lead author Camilo Mora, a climate data analyst at the University of Hawaii, said what is important to note is that the study isn’t about predicting future cases.

“There is no speculation here whatsoever,” Mora said. “These are things that have already happened.”

One example Mora knows firsthand. About five years ago, Mora’s home in rural Colombia was flooded _ for the first time in his memory water was in his living room, creating an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes — and Mora contracted Chikungunya, a nasty virus spread by mosquito bites. And even though he survived, he still feels joint pain years later.

Sometimes climate change acts in odd ways. Mora includes the 2016 case in Siberia when a decades-old reindeer carcass, dead from anthrax, was unearthed when the permafrost thawed from warming. A child touched it, got anthrax and started an outbreak.

Mora originally wanted to search medical cases to see how COVID-19 intersected with climate hazards, if at all. He found cases where extreme weather both exacerbated and diminished chances of COVID-19. In some cases, extreme heat in poor areas had people congregate together to cool off and get exposed to the disease, but in other situations, heavy downpours reduced COVID spread because people stayed home and indoors, away from others.

Longtime climate and public health expert Kristie Ebi at the University of Washington cautioned that she had concerns with how the conclusions were drawn and some of the methods in the study. It is an established fact that the burning of coal, oil and natural gas has led to more frequent and intense extreme weather, and research has shown that weather patterns are associated with many health issues, she said.

“However, correlation is not causation,” Ebi said in an email. “The authors did not discuss the extent to which the climate hazards reviewed changed over the time period of the study and the extent to which any changes have been attributed to climate change.”

But Dr. Aaron Bernstein, interim director of the Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment at Harvard School of Public Health, Emory’s del Rio and three other outside experts said the study is a good warning about climate and health for now and the future. Especially as global warming and habitat loss push animals and their diseases closer to humans, Bernstein said.

“This study underscores how climate change may load the dice to favor unwelcome infectious surprises,” Bernstein said in an email. “But of course it only reports on what we already know and what’s yet unknown about pathogens may be yet more compelling about how preventing further climate change may prevent future disasters like COVID-19.”"
e6d54b58-26c4-4c4a-93d2-2879904fea28,"Climate change can exacerbate a full 58% of the infectious diseases that humans come in contact with worldwide, from common waterborne viruses to deadly diseases like plague, our new research shows.

Our team of environment and health scientists reviewed decades of scientific papers on all known pathogenic disease pathogens to create a map of the human risks aggravated by climate-related hazards.

The numbers were jarring. Of 375 human diseases, we found that 218 of them, well over half, can be affected by climate change.

Flooding, for example, can spread hepatitis. Rising temperatures can expand the life of mosquitoes carrying malaria. Droughts can bring rodents infected with hantavirus into communities as they search for food.

With climate change influencing more than 1,000 transmission pathways like those and climate hazards increasingly globally, we concluded that expecting societies to successfully adapt to all of them isn't a realistic option. The world will need to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that are driving climate change to reduce these risks.

Mapping climate health hazards

To be able to prevent global health crises, humanity needs a comprehensive understanding of the pathways and the magnitude with which climate change might affect pathogenic diseases.

We focused on 10 climate-related hazards linked to rising greenhouse gas emissions: atmospheric warming, heat waves, drought, wildfires, heavy precipitation, flooding, storms, sea-level rise, ocean warming and land cover change. Then we looked for studies discussing specific and quantifiable observations of human disease occurrences linked to those hazards.

In total, we reviewed over 77,000 scientific papers. Of those, 830 papers had a climatic hazard affecting a specific disease in an explicit place and/or time, allowing us to create a database of climatic hazards, transmission pathways, pathogens and diseases. An interactive map of every pathway between hazard and pathogen is available online.

The largest number of diseases aggravated by climate change involved vector-borne transmission, such as those spread by mosquitoes, bats or rodents. Looking at the type of climate hazard, the majority were associated with atmospheric warming (160 diseases), heavy precipitation (122) and flooding (121).

How climate influences pathogen risk

We found four key ways climatic hazards interact with pathogens and humans:

1) Climate-related hazards bring pathogens closer to people.

In some cases, climate-related hazards are shifting the ranges of animals and organisms that can act as vectors for dangerous pathogenic diseases.

For example, warming or changes in precipitation patterns can alter the distribution of mosquitoes, which are vectors of numerous human pathogenic diseases. In recent decades, geographic changes in outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue have been linked to these climatic hazards.

2) Climate-related hazards bring people closer to pathogens.

Climate disasters can also alter human behavior patterns in ways that increase their chances of being exposed to pathogens. For example, during heat waves, people often spend more time in water, which can lead to an increase in waterborne disease outbreaks.

Notably, Vibrio-associated infections increased substantially in Sweden and Finland following a heat wave in northern Scandinavia in 2014.

3) Climate-related hazards enhance pathogens.

In some cases, climate-related hazards have led to either environmental conditions that can increase opportunities for pathogens to interact with vectors or increase the ability of pathogens to cause severe illness in humans.

For example, standing water left by heavy precipitation and flooding can provide breeding grounds for mosquitoes, leading to increased transmission of diseases such as yellow fever, dengue, malaria, West Nile fever and leishmaniasis.

Studies have shown that rising temperatures may also help viruses become more resistant to heat, resulting in increased disease severity as pathogens become better able to adapt to fever in the human body.

For instance, studies have suggested that rising global temperatures are leading to increased heat tolerance of fungal pathogens. The sudden appearance on multiple continents of treatment-resistant human infections of Candida auris, a fungus that was previously nonpathogenic to humans, has been associated with increasing global temperatures. Similarly, fungi in urban environments have been shown to be more heat tolerant than those in rural areas, which tend to be cooler.

4) Climate-related hazards weaken the body's ability to cope with pathogens.

Climate-related hazards can affect the human body's ability to cope with pathogens in two key ways. They can force people into hazardous conditions, such as when disaster damage leads to people living in crowded conditions that might lack good sanitation or increase their exposure to pathogens.

Hazards can also reduce the body's capacity to fight off pathogens, through malnutrition, for example. Living through climatic hazards may also induce increased cortisol production from stress, leading to a reduction in the human body's immune response.

What to do about it

Climate change presents a significant threat to human lives, health and socioeconomic well-being. Our map shows just how extensive that threat can be. In our view, to dial back the risk, humanity will have to put the brakes on the human-caused greenhouse gas emissions fueling global warming.

a9287fc0-bd2f-4315-8554-f202b7bf9870,"South Korean capital will stop issuing permits to build basement flats after four people drowned by floodwater trapped in their home.

Authorities in Seoul are moving to ban the typically cramped basement flats in the South Korean capital, after several people drowned during flooding caused by record-breaking rains.

The Seoul Metropolitan Government said on Thursday it was planning to get rid of the tiny subterranean dwellings – known as “banjiha” and featured in the Oscar-winning film Parasite – which are typically cheap to rent but prone to damp and flooding.

The local government said it would stop issuing permits to construct such homes, while pushing to gradually phase out existing basement and semi-basement flats.

The city plans to begin discussions with the national government to ban the use of basements or semi-basement spaces for residential purposes, it added.

Some 200,000 households live in such flats, which make up about 5 percent of housing stock in Seoul, according to official figures.

Four out of 11 people killed in this week’s downpours – the heaviest in more than 100 years – drowned after their basement flats were inundated with floodwater, officials said.

The deaths – including of a disabled woman and a teenager, who were trapped by floodwater in their basement apartment – have caused public outrage.

President Yoon Suk-yeol visited their destroyed home this week, before calling on officials to do more to help the poor and vulnerable during natural disasters.

The banjiha received global attention due to Bong Joon Ho’s Parasite, which won the 2020 Best Picture Oscar and features a poor family living in such a basement home.

Activists blamed the deaths on the government’s housing policies, saying they were preventable disasters.

“We condemn the government’s negligence regarding those marginalised people in this housing,” said the Citizens’ Coalition for Economic Justice in a statement.

“As rainfall becomes stronger and more frequent under the influence of climate change, [Seoul] must embark on a fundamental change of its approach to basement residents,” it added.

Yoon has also blamed climate change for the rains and flooding, which he said were the worst since weather records began more than a century ago.

“Those who struggle financially or with physical difficulties are bound to be more vulnerable to natural disasters,” he said."

SEOUL, Aug 11 (Reuters) - The heaviest rain in Seoul in 115 years has spurred the South Korean capital to revive a $1.15 billion plan to improve drainage after floods exposed how even the affluent Gangnam district is vulnerable to climate change-driven extreme weather.

Experts say the city's capacity to drain water is far behind what's needed to handle a deluge like the one suffered this week. That has disasterous implications for low-lying areas like Gangnam, as these bouts of extreme weather are becoming increasingly common.

This week's torrential rain killed at least 11 people across the northern part of the country, as of Thursday morning. The downpour, which began on Monday and shifted southwards on Wednesday, knocked out power, caused landslides and flooded roads and subways. read more

Monetary estimates of the damage were still being compiled.

In the wake of the downpour, Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon announced on Wednesday the city will spend 1.5 trillion won ($1.15 billion) in the next decade to build six massive underground tunnels to store and release rainwater to prevent flooding.

""The damage from this record rainfall shows that there are limits with short-term water control measures when unusual weather conditions due to global warming have become common,"" Mayor Oh said, vowing to establish a city-wide system capable of handling 100 mm (3.94 inches) rainfall an hour from the current 95 mm.

The city's development meant increased pavement and impermeable surfaces, leading to higher runoff and more flooding. More than 50% of Seoul's land areas are impermeable, with the figure much higher in the affluent Gangnam district with wide boulevards and office buildings, experts said.

""It's always a see-saw game between cost and safety,"" said Moon Young-il, a professor of civil engineering at University of Seoul. ""We need to find a balance point and 100 mm seems reasonable enough.""

Seoul had lacked any detailed plan for water control as it grew from a city of 2 to 3 million people in the 1960s to one with over 10 million by the 1990s, Moon said.

The underground tunnels were originally proposed in 2011 after heavy rains and landslides killed 16 people, many of them in Gangnam. But the plan was put on hold amid decreased precipitation and budget issues in the following years.

The Seoul city also plans to ban basement or lower ground apartments after three family members including a woman with developmental disabilities drowned in their home on Monday. read more

The calamitous wet weather prompted President Yoon Suk-yeol to hold a series of meetings with officials this week, to find fundamental ways to improve South Korea's preparedness against similar climate change-induced disasters.

Warmer weather increases moisture levels in the air, leading to more intense rainfall. So while there has been little change in the annual precipitation over the past four decades, the frequency of heavy rains in Seoul has increased by 27% since the 2000s, according to a 2021 report by the Seoul Institute.

""It was indeed an extreme weather. But we can no longer call this kind of weather event unusual,"" President Yoon told a meeting on Wednesday. ""The largest, highest record can be broken at any time.""

Banjiha, which gained global recognition in the 2020 Oscar-winning film Parasite, are usually occupied by people on low incomes and have come to symbolise the growing inequality in South Korea, Asia’s fourth-biggest economy.

But anger over the dangers facing banjiha residents in the capital has prompted a rethink among officials, who said the city would no longer grant permits to build the homes and existing apartments would be converted over time.

Two sisters in their 40s and a girl identified as the younger sister’s 13-year-old daughter drowned on Monday as the heaviest rainfall to hit Seoul for 115 years sent torrents of water along streets, inundating apartments and subway stations. A fourth person living in a banjiha also died in the flooding, media reports said.

The three victims, who lived in the city’s Gwanak district, pleaded for help as water surged into their flat, but emergency workers were unable to reach them, the Yonhap news agency said. Their bodies were found after police and firefighters had finished draining the apartment, it added.

The Seoul government had already promised help for families living in banjiha after the flats featured in Parasite, Bong Joon-ho’s film about the Kims, a poor family whose mouldy basement flat contrasts with the sprawling mansion owned by their employers, the Parks. In one scene, the Kims’ toilet spews filthy sludge during a flood.

Speaking before Parasite became the first foreign-language film to win best picture, Bong spoke of the “subtle nuances” found in banjiha. “People live underground but want to believe that they are above the ground because they have a moment when sunlight comes into their room,” he said.

“But at the same time, they are afraid of falling into a complete underground situation if things get worse.”

Under the new proposals, landlords will be given 10-20 years to covert banjiha for non-residential use.

According to official data, Seoul was home to about 200,000 semi-basement flats in 2020, comprising 5% of all households in the city. Well over half of the country’s banjiha are in the capital, where soaring property prices were a key issue in this year’s presidential election.

The South Korean president, Yoon Suk-yeol, apologised to residents during a visit to the flat where the three victims lived, and promised to help them recover from the disaster, which killed at least 11 people and left eight others missing.

Civic groups demanded an overhaul of housing policy and called on the government to help residents of semi-basement flats move out.

“We condemn the government’s negligence on those marginalised in housing for this tragedy,” the Citizens Coalitions for Economic Justice said in a statement published in the Korea Herald.

“As rainfall becomes stronger and more frequent as a result of climate change, it must embark on a fundamental change of its approach to semi-basement residents.”

Another group urged the government to build affordable housing so people on low incomes no longer needed to live in dangerous semi-basement flats.

Ha In-sik was among the banjiha residents taking stock of the damage to their homes in Sillim, a deprived district of south-western Seoul.

“I’ve got no money, nothing,” said Ha, 50, who used a plastic bowl to scoop the water from his lower-ground apartment. “I had come here to live in this basement as it was the only way I could live with my daughter.”

“But I’m hopeless now,” he said, adding that it would take about 10 days to make the flat habitable again. “Everything is gone, there’s no help and I don’t even have a spoon to eat with.”

Banjiha appeared in 1970 after the government made basement floors mandatory in new construction projects. Although it was illegal to live below ground, the subterranean spaces attracted residents as the city’s population swelled during a period of rapid growth in the South Korean economy.

Building regulations were relaxed in 1984 to allow developers to build flats higher up, with half of the property located below ground and half above ground, according to Yonhap.

Casualties from this week's heavy rains have risen to 11 people dead and eight others missing, officials said Thursday.

Of the dead, six were in Seoul, three in Gyeonggi Province and two in Gangwon Province while three of the eight unaccounted for were from Seoul, according to data from the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters.

A total of 3,775 homes and buildings were inundated, most of them in Seoul.

Over 980 people from 548 households, mostly from the wider Seoul area, have been displaced, which left them staying at local schools and gyms. A further 4,297 people from 2,042 households across the country have temporarily evacuated, officials said.

Seoul is considering banning construction of the underground and semi-underground homes. Landlords will be given 10 to 20 years to remove such structures known as “banjiha” homes from existing buildings. As of 2020, about 200,000 homes – 5 per cent of dwellings in the city – were basement or half-basement flats, according to the Seoul Metropolitan Government.

The announcement came after the worst storm in 115 years dumped 525mm of rain in parts of Seoul earlier this week and killed at least 11 people. Among them were three family members – a woman in her 40s, her sister and her sibling’s teenage daughter – found dead after being trapped in a submerged semi-basement home in Sillim-dong, not far from the affluent Gangnam area. Another woman in her 50s who lived in a similar residence also drowned at home, according to DongA Ilbo newspaper.

At least eight people have died in and around Seoul, South Korea overnight, after torrential rain knocked out power, caused landslides and left roads and subways submerged.

The southern part of the national capital received more than 100 millimetres of rain per hour on late Monday, with some parts of the city hit with 141.5 millimetres, the heaviest rainfall in decades, according to the Korea Meteorological Administration.

President Yoon Suk-yeol on Tuesday visited a semi-basement apartment where three family members had died the night before after swift moving flood waters filled the space.

The dangers of such underground flats, called banjiha, were famously depicted in a flooding scene in the 2020 Oscar-winning film Parasite.

Mr Yoon told the area’s residents he would try to ensure their lives returned to normal as quickly as possible, and he instructed officials to look at measures to better ensure housing safety, according to a statement from his office.

At least five people had died in Seoul and three others in the neighbouring Gyeonggi Province by early Tuesday, the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters said.

Four, including the three family members, had died after being drowned in flooded buildings, one was believed to have been electrocuted, another person was found under the wreckage of a bus stop, and the others two died in a landslide, it said.

At least nine people were injured, while seven were missing.

In the glitzy, dense Gangnam district, some buildings and stores were flooded and were without power, while cars, buses and subway stations were submerged, leaving people stranded.

Data showed at least 765 facilities had been damaged. About 52 highways and roads have been blocked.

About 391 people were displaced in the greater Seoul area, most of whom had to stay at local schools and gyms. A further 399 had temporarily moved to community centres and schools, according to the data.

The headquarters raised the crisis alert to the highest and requested organisations adjust their working hours.

The KMA issued heavy rain warnings across the capital and the metropolitan area of 26 million as well parts of Gangwon and Chungcheong Province.

The KMA expects heavy rainfall for the central part of the country to continue until at least Wednesday.

South Korea often experiences heavy rains in summer, but “such sharp increase in precipitation and frequent torrential rains cannot be explained without the big trend of climate change,” a KMA official, who spoke in condition of anonymity, told Reuters.

""Air conditioning is some of the best technology we know to help humans cope with a rise in climate,"" said Jacob Kincer, a senior policy analyst at the Energy for Growth Hub where he researches emerging clean energy technologies.

But he understands not everyone in the province has access to air conditioning.

""It really shouldn't be seen as a luxury that makes things a little more comfortable because, a lot of times, heat waves kill people,"" he said.

Extreme heat in 2021 claimed 619 lives across the province as temperatures broke records and surpassed 40 C for several days in a row in late June and early July.

Nearly three-quarters of the deaths happened in the Fraser and Vancouver Coastal health authorities and most who died didn't have adequate cooling systems like air conditioners or fans in their homes.

""This is not a problem that's going away. It's actually going to get a lot worse,"" Kincer said.

""It's something where we have to figure out how to make it work. So, that means finding ways to make air conditioning more efficient, making people's homes more insulated so there's a lower energy usage when you do use it,"" he continued.

And the demand is ever-growing — global energy demand from AC is expected to triple by 2050.

While it's meant to cool you down, one expert says AC units can have the opposite effect on the planet.

""Electricity can be generated cleanly, as we do here from BC Hydro or in many places of the world, it's using a lot of coal. When we do that, it puts a lot of carbon dioxide out in the atmosphere which contributes to climate change,' said Werner Antweiler, an associate professor at the UBC Sauder School of Business.

Even with clean electricity, he said AC still leaves an environmental footprint with harmful chemicals released by these cooling systems.

""There are concerns about the refrigerants that are used in air conditioning units. There are some older types that are using refrigerants that are harmful to the climate,"" Antweiler said.

""And there's a global push to change the type of refrigerants that we're currently using and make them less harmful to the environment,"" he continued.

Several groups in Vancouver have been calling on all levels of government to make air conditioning more accessible, especially to those most vulnerable to the effects of extreme heat, including seniors, those living alone and people with underlying health issues.

08753dee-e807-4760-828a-d36fd9671399,"Amid a growing number of heat waves, air conditioners have become a lifeline. Because these appliances are critical to keeping people cool — and protecting them from dangerously hot weather — the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that there may be more than 5 billion air conditioners across the planet by 2050. The problem is that while air conditioners do keep people safe, they’re also a major contributor to climate change.

So why not rethink the AC entirely?

The basic science of air conditioners hasn’t changed much since they were first invented about a century ago, but these appliances have become a bigger and bigger threat to life on Earth. Most modern air conditioners consume a massive amount of energy, strain the electrical grid during sweltering summer days, and use harmful chemicals, called refrigerants, that trap heat in the atmosphere. That’s why, along with a vast number of other structural changes the world will need to make to fight climate change, some experts say it’s time to change how we cool our homes.

“We need to design our buildings in a way that consumes less energy. We need to insulate them better. We need to ventilate them better,” explained Ankit Kalanki, a manager at Third Derivative, a climate tech accelerator co-founded by the sustainability research organization RMI. “These strategies are very important. We can reduce the air conditioning demand in the first place, but we cannot eliminate that.”

The race to redesign the AC is already on. The IEA predicts that within the next three decades, two-thirds of the world’s homes could have air conditioners. About half of these units will be installed in just three countries: India, China, and Indonesia. The extent to which these new air conditioners will exacerbate climate change hinges on replacing the cooling tech we currently use with something better. Right now, ideas range from retrofitting our windows to more far-out concepts, like rooftop panels that reflect sunlight and emit heat into space. To succeed, however, the world will need to boost the efficiency of the appliances we already have — as quickly as possible — and invest in new tech that could avoid some of AC’s primary problems.

The AC’s noxious environmental impact stems from its core technology: vapor compression. This tech involves several components, but it generally works by converting a refrigerant that’s stored inside an AC from a liquid to a gas, which allows it to absorb heat, removing it from a room. Vapor compression uses an immense amount of electricity on the hottest days, and there are growing concerns that the technology might eventually overwhelm the grid’s capacity to provide power. And hydrofluorocarbons, the chemical refrigerants that many ACs use to soak up heat, are greenhouse gases that trap lots of heat in our atmosphere when leaked into the air. The challenge is that, for now, vapor compression ACs are still a critical tool during deadly heat waves, especially for high-risk populations, young children, older adults, and people with certain health conditions.

Related The air conditioning paradox

Technology to build cleaner, more efficient air conditioners does exist. Two major AC manufacturers, Daikin and Gree Electric Appliances, shared the top award at last year’s Global Cooling Prize, an international competition focused on designing climate-friendly AC tech. Both companies created ACs with higher internal performance that used less environmentally damaging refrigerants; the new units could reduce their impact on the climate by five times. These models aren’t yet on the market — Gree plans to start selling its prototype in 2025, and Daikin told Recode that it hopes to use the new technology in future products — but the IEA estimates that using more efficient ACs could cut cooling’s environmental impact by half.

Another strategy is to double down on heat pumps, which are air conditioners that also work in reverse, using vapor compression to absorb and move heat into a home, instead of releasing it outside. Heat pumps usually cost several thousand dollars, though the Inflation Reduction Act includes a proposal for a significant heat pump rebate, and President Joe Biden has invoked the Defense Production Act to ramp up production. Experts have argued installing heat pumps is critical to another important climate goal: transitioning away from fossil fuel-powered furnaces, which are an even bigger source of emissions than cooling. The holy grail of HVAC would be a heat pump that could provide both heating and cooling but isn’t dependent on vapor compression.

“Heat pumps are a critical technology in reducing our energy consumption, enhancing grid reliability and the utilization of renewable power, reducing emissions, reducing our reliance on foreign sources of energy, and lowering utility bills for US families and businesses,” Antonio Bouza, a technology manager at the Department of Energy, told Recode. The next step, he said, is reducing emissions even further by designing heat pumps that don’t rely on refrigerants, as current vapor compression systems do.

Another challenge, though, is that heat pumps are not the easiest appliance to install, especially for renters, who don’t necessarily have the money or ability to invest in bulky HVAC systems. To address this problem, a company called Gradient has designed a heat pump that easily slides over a windowsill — it doesn’t block light — and currently uses a refrigerant called R32, which is supposed to have a (comparatively) low global warming potential. Gradient recently won a contract to install its units in New York City public housing.

A fleet of new companies want to make even bigger changes to how we cool our homes. One of these startups is Blue Frontier, which is backed by Bill Gates’s investment fund, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, and plans to start selling its futuristic AC units in 2025. The company’s technology uses a specialized salt solution that can release water into the air — or draw it out — which allows the AC to control its temperature. This approach, Blue Frontier claims, can save up to 90 percent of the energy used by a traditional AC and avoids draining electricity from the grid during peak hours.

“By eliminating air conditioning that’s a problem for the grid, it allows the grid to actually reduce the costs of power production [and] utilize renewable energies in a more effective manner,” Daniel Betts, the CEO of the company, told Recode. “So not only do we save energy, but we are saving energy at the moments that are most critical.”

Scientists and startups are playing with other concepts, too. One path, which the company Transaera is taking, is to develop new materials that efficiently soak up moisture from the air, almost like a sponge, so that air conditioners can work more efficiently. A similar concept is to take advantage of solid-state technology. This idea would use solid materials to absorb heat, and some research on it has support from the US Department of Energy. The British firm Barocal is developing a type of plastic crystal that could do this and also help control temperature. One company, Phononic, has developed a solid-state core that could be integrated into existing HVAC systems. The company says its first commercial installation will be next year.

While many of these technological breakthroughs are promising, the movement to revolutionize air conditioning still faces some major challenges. Right now, AC manufacturers primarily focus on meeting minimum performance standards, rather than competing for higher levels of efficiency. Consumers also tend to buy air conditioners based on their sticker price, not an AC’s overall impact on their energy bills. And even though there are a growing number of AC-focused startups, the industry is still dominated by a small handful of large companies, all of which primarily focus on far-from-ideal vapor compression tech.

“We don’t install more efficient technologies unless we really need to, or it’s mandated by a government or another organization,” said Eli Goldstein, the co-founder and CEO of SkyCool, a startup developing tech that could be used to send heat from buildings and ACs into space. “Ultimately, the key is going to be dollar investments from both private and public enterprises to deploy the technologies.”

Other changes, like better insulating our homes and installing batteries throughout the grid, are still critical in the fight against climate change. However, all signs indicate that humans will continue to buy air conditioners, not just to feel comfortable but to survive increasingly devastating weather brought on by climate change. This is especially true as temperatures and incomes rise in some of the world’s largest countries and fastest-growing economies. In India alone, demand for cooling tech was already growing between 15 and 20 percent every year, as of 2020.

This surging demand creates a promising, but incredibly risky, situation. There’s the possibility that the growing need for cooling spurs a race to build the best AC technology and, ideally, tech that could also displace fossil fuel-based heating. But if better, more affordable AC doesn’t come to market fast enough — especially for the vast number of people in developing countries who will buy these appliances in the coming decades — significantly worse air conditioners will take their place, warming the planet even faster.

0fd37ddb-6809-48b8-9e14-16c7de21db4f,"This just in from the laboratory: When it comes to the air conditioner chugging away in the window, it’s not the heat — but the humidity that’s causing it to work overtime.

An analysis by researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden found that on average more than half of the energy used by residential air conditioning around the globe deals with the moisture hanging in the air on a hot day.

And the projections are that it will become an even bigger challenge as a result of climate change leading to more hot days with warmer air capable of holding more moisture.

The AC is already working hard. In July, a massive heat dome led to heat warnings for more than 100 million people from Portland, Oregon, which saw an unprecedented seven consecutive days above 95 degrees, to Oklahoma City, where it hit 110 degrees.

Denver recorded its second warmest July on record with 16 days at 96 degrees or better, including three days at 100 degrees. On Aug. 3, another heat dome put more than 100 million people under heat warnings and advisories — from Minneapolis to North Texas.

That’s a lot of air conditioning.

The humidity factor does vary from region to region. “Removal of the latent load of moisture will become a bigger issue, though not here in Colorado,” said Iain Campbell, a senior fellow at RMI, an energy think tank. “We live in a desert. If you are in Florida or the tropics, you are out of luck.”

There has been a clear downward trend in humidity since 1980 in the Upper Colorado and Rio Grande basins, including all of western Colorado and the San Luis Valley, Russ Schumacher, the Colorado state climatologist, said in an email.

“On the Front Range and Eastern Plains, it’s not as clear whether there are meaningful trends,” Schumacher said. “Overall, considering that Colorado is far from an ocean, we won’t see the increases in humidity that are expected (and in some places already happening) in coastal areas as the climate continues to warm.”

So for Colorado it is a good news-bad news proposition. There is low humidity in part because we are in a megadrought, with demands to cut water use, reservoirs tapping out, and farm fields shriveling in oppressive heat — but it’s a dry heat.

By way of reference, the average June relative humidity — a measure of how much water vapor is in the air-water mix — in Denver is 46% and in Miami 73%. For every 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature the air can hold 7% more moisture — if there is any moisture around.

Current air conditioning technology is reasonably effective at removing moisture — albeit with some extra energy — up to 60% relative humidity. After that, it’s all heavy lifting.

“In the future there will be places where it will be too hot and too humid to be outdoors,” said Jason Woods, a senior research engineer at NREL, and co-author of the study on air conditioning and humidity.

Still even without humidity, in bone-dry Texas the demand for cooling electricity was so high during the July heat wave that the state’s electric grid operator initiated emergency measures to avoid rolling blackouts.

Texas’ experience is one reason Colorado Public Utilities Commission Chairman Eric Blank asked Xcel Energy, the state’s largest electricity provider, to do some “worst-case scenario” planning for a heat wave.

The real question is: Why, when it is clear that humidity has been a problem hardly anyone has done anything about it, as almost all air conditioners today are using 100-year-old vapor compression technology?

Today’s AC is based on turn of the 20th century tech

To be sure, vast improvements have been made in that technology and today’s units are to the first air conditioners what the BMW 4.4-liter Turbocharged V8 is to the Model-T Ford’s engine.

Still, both the BMW and the Model T have internal combustion engines. Now electric vehicles are poised to send the gasoline-powered car the way of the horse-drawn buggy, and LED lights are banishing Thomas Edison’s incandescent bulbs.

Meanwhile, ever-improving solar panels are decking rooftops and Tesla Powerwalls are being installed to store electricity at home, but the air conditioner is chugging along on the technology invented in Brooklyn, N.Y., at the turn of the 20th century.

“The pace of evolution of the AC industry is alarmingly slow even considering the best available technology,” a report by the RMI concluded.

An aging air conditioner protrudes from the window of a building in Denver’s Capitol Hill neighborhood. Much of the technology inside the box was developed at the turn of the 20th century. (Olivia Sun, The Colorado Sun via Report for America)

This may not be the state of affairs for much longer as researchers, including those at NREL, and companies are searching for new AC technologies that in a two-step process remove moisture and then cool the air.

“They are in a very early stage of development,” said Antonio Bouza, a technology manager at the U.S. Department of Energy. “Just as the internal combustion engine is being displaced by EVs, that’s what we want to do with these technologies.”

It was humidity, ironically, not heat that began the march to the window air conditioner, when a 25-year-old engineer named Willis Haviland Carrier experimented in 1902 with humidity controls for a Brooklyn printing plant bedeviled by swelling pages and blurry prints in summer.

By 1933, Carrier had founded the Carrier Air Conditioning Company of America making a unit with technology that became the model for the industry.

It wasn’t until the 1950s that residential air conditioning started to grow in the U.S. Still, in 1952 only 2% of homes had AC and it remained exotic enough to play a role in the 1955 movie “The Seven Year Itch.”

“You have air conditioning! How does it work?” a hot Marilyn Monroe (the story takes place in the summer) breathily asked her lecherous downstairs neighbor as she stands in front of the unit lifting her blouse to bare her midriff.

“The way I feel about air conditioning,” the neighbor, played by Tom Ewell, explains, “no matter how much it costs, if there is no bread in the house, if you have to sell the kid’s bonds, in the summertime in New York City you’ve got to have air conditioning.”

A still from the 1955 movie “The Seven Year Itch”

By 2020, more than 88% of the households in the U.S. had air conditioning and in the next 30 years it will be the fastest-growing energy use in buildings, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Almost all air conditioners deal with humidity by cooling to the dew point, when the moisture in the air drops out as water. This is cooler than need be for comfort and when the water is rung out of the air it releases additional heat with which the air conditioner must cope.

To do the extra work an AC system needs an extra 20% to 30% of capacity, said Eric Kozubal, an NREL researcher developing new cooling technologies and a co-author of the study on AC energy use.

The NREL analysis divided the globe into 60-mile-by-60-mile boxes and within each box added population, a measure of economic activity, air conditioning ownership and weather.

Air conditioning accounts for 4% of the world’s annual greenhouse gas emissions

The study also took into account how much the electric grid depended upon fossil fuels, since the goal was to estimate through computer modeling greenhouse gas emissions from air conditioning.

The researchers calculated that almost 4% of the world’s annual greenhouse gas emissions — 1,950 million tons — come from air conditioning. The bulk of that, 1,190 million tons, were linked to standard air conditioning work cooling and dehumidifying, with the latter accounting for 52% of the emissions.

The rest of the emissions come from refrigerants leaking from units and the releases associated with the manufacture and transport of those units.

The NREL modeling projects that greenhouse gas emissions for temperature and humidity loads will grow five times larger by 2050 as there are more and more air conditioners — particularly in the hottest and most humid places, such as India, Indonesia, China and Southeast Asia.

RMI estimates that providing electricity to the 4.5 billion air conditioners running in 2050, will take 2,000 gigawatts of new electric generating capacity — equal to nearly 2,700 of Colorado’s largest power plant, Comanche 3.

“This is why we need new and better technology,” RMI’s Campbell said.

The federal government sets and periodically increases the minimum energy performance standards for air conditioners, but these do not drive innovation.

“The minimum energy performance standards now are equal to the best available technology 40 or 50 years ago,” Campbell said.

There are versions of the current AC technology that are two times more efficient than what is being sold at the local big box store, but they are more expensive.

One problem is the emphasis on the unit’s upfront price tag rather than its lifetime cost, Campbell said. “Does it help consumers to give them a really cheap piece of equipment that is expensive to run?” he asked. “We’d have to call this a market failure.”

Better AC technology a better solution than a new electric grid

If all the air conditioners in Texas were today’s most efficient units it would have cut the July spike in demand in half and likely avoided any emergency measures or threats of blackout.

“This would also be a much cheaper solution than increasing grid capacity in order to serve an ever-growing base of inefficient air conditioners,” Campbell said.

Another problem is the fact that the industry is heavily concentrated with fewer than 500 manufacturers worldwide, creating a high bar to entry, according to RMI.

In an effort to jump-start technological innovation, RMI and the Indian government offered a Global Cooling Prize with $3 million in prize money.

Two of the world’s top air conditioning manufacturers — Japan’s Daikin Global and China’s Gree Electric — won with prototypes that improved upon existing technology by adding a second cooling or evaporative coil to deal with humidity, Campbell said.

The second coil and a more finely tuned motor made these prototypes seven times more efficient removing humidity and four times more energy efficient, Campbell said.

Still, they were in essence old-school Carrier technology. Meanwhile around the country, in national labs, universities and startup companies, researchers are working on the next generation of air conditioners.

Using electrostatic charges, membranes and desiccants, which soak up moisture, researchers are trying to develop ways of getting humidity out of the air before cooling — some have received federal funding.

“We aren’t picking a winner. The DOE has funded a lot of technologies with the aim of delivering comfort that is affordable,” Bouza said.

At NREL, Kozubal has been working on twinning cooling with desiccants, which come as solids and liquids.

Using a lithium chloride solution — 10 times saltier than the sea with a strong affinity to absorb water — an NREL team, led by Kozubal, and a start-up company 7AC developed a dehumidifying technology that was ultimately acquired by Emerson, a multinational engineering and industrial services company.

“The Emerson technology is brand new and going into a pilot demonstration phase,” Kozubal said.

The amount of energy such a system could save where it is sticky-humid would be substantial. “You save about 50% of the energy,” Kozubal said. “The added cost of the system could easily be paid for by the energy savings.”

Blue Frontier, a Boca Raton, Florida, startup backed by Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, is also using NREL patented liquid desiccant technology matched with evaporative cooling, which, when it gets to market, the company says will deliver up to 80% energy savings compared with vapor compression.

Both the Emerson and Blue Frontier air conditioning units are aimed at the commercial market. “Residential, that might be something farther in the future,” Kozubal said.

Still, improvements in air condition technology are needed across the board as days get hotter and heat waves get longer. “Right now, our grid is very stressed, even though renewables are going in. In the immediate future more efficient air conditioning helps us save energy,” Kozubal said."

Billions of people need air conditioning to combat the deadly heat, which raises the question: Should access to it be a human right?

One critique of supplying more air conditioning units is the environmental harm it would cause. Dr. Morgan Bazilian, director of the Payne Institute for Public Policy at the Colorado School of Mines, has been searching for cooling technology that’s both efficient and sustainable.

“If you look at an issue where you're going to want to increase the energy demand in developing countries, then we have to go back to the fundamentals of how we design energy systems and how we focus,” he says.

Bazilian says the technology already exists to provide more efficient AC units: Companies like Carrier have built units that are three times more energy efficient, so technology isn’t the obstacle, Bazilian says. Rather, it's a matter of policy.

National and local governments are key to supplying more air conditioning units. The issue of cooling has caught the attention of top decision-makers and organizations like the United Nations. To ensure the solution is enforceable and robust, Bazilian wants it to happen at the national or international level.

In the U.S., landlords are already required to provide heat for tenants, but laws regarding AC access vary from state to state. Bazilian says efforts by the Biden administration to provide energy services to those in need are promising.

“I think you're going to see a sort of strong movement under this administration to make sure that things like cooling become as mandatory as heating in some places,” he says.

Yet, one of the quickest and most sought-after solutions to deal with extreme temperature, air conditioners, could rapidly increase global warming.

This spike in deadly temperatures has experts predicting greater demand for air conditioning. Currently the world has roughly 3.6 billion units operating globally, but it is estimated by 2050 the world will need as many as 14 billion total air conditioning units, a 289% increase. While this increase is certainly justified in terms of the immediate relief air conditioning can provide, it could also be a climate disaster.

And: Humans are to blame for the extreme weather that broiled London — here’s just how much

This is due to gases called hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are a group of industrial chemicals primarily used for refrigeration and cooling, including in most air conditioners.

HFCs are a major climate concern due to their high global warming potential (GWP). GWP is a measure of the warming potential of 1 ton of a gas, once emitted into the atmosphere, relative to 1 ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) in a given period of time.

The HFCs in your air conditioner could have a GWP score well over 3,000. This means HFCs heat the planet 1,000s of times more than CO2 .

“ Introducing billions more appliances over the next decade could easily push current climate goals out of reach. ”

These high-GWP substances are also found within foam insulation and refrigeration appliances, which will also be increasingly called upon with extreme temperatures. These substances have been leaking for decades,contributing to nearly 10% of global warming emissions. It is expected their emissions will rise by a staggering 90% from 2017 levels by 2050. Introducing billions of more appliances over the next decade could easily push current climate goals out of reach.

The good news is there are appliances ready for market now that use much lower GWP compounds – some representing more than a 1,000% reduction from what is typically used in appliances currently. Legislation passed last year that will reduce the production and consumption of HFCs in the U.S. by 85% over the next 15 years. Both efforts will, over time, move the market towards low-GWP appliances.

“ A global phase down of HFCs could prevent 0.5 degrees of warming by 2100. ”

While these efforts will certainly begin a shift to lower-impact alternatives, they won’t shift the market at the scale and speed we need. Switching to low-GWP options requires new equipment, which often means new and potentially costly investments. This means high-emitting HFC appliances will enter the market and contribute to climate change for many years to come. Avoiding these additional HFCs in the near-term will significantly impact long-term global warming.

So how can we rapidly drive the use of the available existing alternatives?

The carbon market might just be part of the answer. Generating carbon credits can provide the financing needed to incentivize manufacturers to produce appliances utilizing ultra-low GWP compounds at competitive costs faster, preventing a significant amount of HFC emissions.

“ Carbon markets may provide an opportunity for U.S. leadership on the global stage. ”

By transitioning away from high-GWP appliances, the world could avoid around four to eight years of total annual global greenhouse gas emissions, based on 2018 levels, over the next four decades. A global phase down of HFCs could prevent 0.5 degrees of warming by 2100.

Carbon markets may also provide an opportunity for U.S. leadership on the global stage. The incentives supporting manufacturers’ rapid switch to low GWP appliances could create a competitive advantage for U.S. manufacturing in international markets as the world moves to address climate change.

There is the potential to catalyze the changes we need over the next few years, not over a decade, if we leverage the power of carbon markets. Taking advantage of this opportunity can provide both the U.S. and the world with access to the technologies needed to stay cool, and keep the planet cool as well.

Record sustained high temperatures this summer across Europe, the United States and other parts of the world have brought into focus both the benefits and challenges of a global society increasingly dependent on air conditioning. In places where air conditioning is unusual or nonexistent, record-shattering heat is taking a deadly toll.

In much of the United States, air conditioning is fairly ubiquitous, however. The technology grew and developed here in critical ways, and helped shape the politics and history of the United States itself. Its spread across the country — early in D.C., and then across the South and Sun Belt — helped to transform the movement of Americans and regional distribution of political and economic power since World War II. This history shows how changes in the built environment have contributed to the climate crisis and points to the urgency of transforming our buildings to mitigate the effects.

Initially in the early 20th century, air conditioning was developed in the United States to increase economic productivity, by making industrial workplaces and then public spaces such as movie theaters more comfortable for workers and consumers.

This extended to Capitol Hill, where, beginning in the 1920s, Congress, after much debate, appropriated funds for the air conditioning of the U.S. Capitol and nearby House and Senate office buildings. Air conditioning transformed the annual cycle of congressional activity. Before air conditioning, a session of Congress typically lasted for less than 300 days, adjourning by the end of June for the summer. The city was largely deserted from mid-June to September, even in periods of national crisis. Yet, in years after 1938, when air conditioning became operational throughout Capitol Hill, Congress carried its sessions past 300 days and beyond the end of June, when heat waves settled over Washington. Air conditioning curtailed calls for early adjournment.

Air conditioning also transformed daily bureaucratic life in buildings such as the Pentagon, which had the world’s largest air-conditioning plant in a single structure when it opened in 1943. By the 1950s, the General Services Administration found that productivity in government offices increased by 9.5 percent when air conditioning was installed. In Washington, where peak temperatures of 106 degrees and 60 percent humidity had been recorded, air conditioning, “far from being a mere luxury,” proved “essential for normal operating efficiency of personnel.”

The experience of Washington’s many federal employees with air conditioning on the job was a key factor in raising demand for it in other settings, including department stores, theaters, hotels and other commercial sites seeking to draw more consumers.

The rationing of electric power and equipment during World War II initially slowed local adoption of air conditioning in D.C. But as early as 1942, the area’s Potomac Electric Power (Pepco) became the nation’s first summer-peaking utility, meaning that more electricity was used in summer to support air conditioning than was used in winter to power heating equipment. By 1953, Washington had more air conditioning per capita than any other American city. In 1966, about 56 percent of Pepco’s residential customers, including those in the suburbs, had air conditioning of some type; by 1981, that number had risen to nearly 90 percent.

Washington’s transformation anticipated air conditioning’s effects across the South and the Sun Belt. Its capacity to mitigate the effects of Southern climate made the South and Southwest attractive for industrial and related demographic growth, shifting economic and political power from its traditional centers on the East Coast and in the Midwest. It made intolerably hot places in the summer habitable and made some of them, from Southern California to Florida, attractive to retirees, new white-collar industries and other year-round newcomers. Improving the indoor environment with air conditioning also enabled the lengthening of the Southern school year by addressing, as one observer noted in 1946, “Unquestionably, one of the largest single obstacles to greater educational advancement in the Deep South.” That is, “the physical conditions under which the faculty and pupils must work.”

In 1940, the most populous states were New York, Pennsylvania and Illinois. Swelling populations in Florida, Texas and California made these the three most populous states by 2015. Between 1940 and 1980, warmer states collectively gained 29 electoral college votes, while the colder states of the Northeast and the Rust Belt lost 31. From 1900 to 1948, only two presidents or vice presidents came from Southern states, but from 1952 through 2004, every winning presidential ticket included at least one such candidate.

Air conditioning has not only shaped the United States, but the world as well. While it is still less widespread in Europe, it is growing there. Japan adopted air conditioning in commercial buildings in Tokyo in the 1930s, and the technology rapidly advanced there, including in homes, from 1960 to 1990. Yet in southern India there was very little air conditioning until the mid-1990s. In China in 1999, air-conditioning units were in about 20 percent of urban households; by 2007 that figure had risen to 80 percent. For equatorial nations such as Singapore and perpetually hot regions like the Persian Gulf, air conditioning has been crucial for development.

A key problem is that air conditioning has always been energy intensive. By 2000, 48 percent of the energy consumed by buildings in the United States (the largest single component) was used for comfort cooling and refrigeration. The release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere from fossil fuels involved in powering air conditioning has made it central to climate change.

A core dilemma is that as global warming increases, the world will need air conditioning more, but air conditioning is among those technologies that increase global warming.

Its centrality both as a technology essential to global health and comfort and as a contributor to global energy demands and global warming mean that it behooves the world community to develop technologies and policies that will enable us to access this modern mechanism’s benefits while decreasing its inordinate consumption of resources and bad environmental effects.

Just as air conditioning has transformed where and how we live, efforts to mitigate the harms of climate change focus partly in how we approach our built environment. Since the late 1970s, states have recognized the importance of reducing energy consumption in buildings and have adopted policies to reduce air conditioning’s dependence on electricity generated by burning fossil fuels. In the early 21st century, the culture of green building has developed rapidly. Improved material envelopes for buildings, mechanical systems that use less energy and digital monitoring of those systems have reduced energy use. Passive house standards, net-zero carbon buildings and net-zero energy buildings are concepts that have taken hold throughout the developed world, where air-conditioning’s use is highest per capita, with an ever-broadening commitment and cooperation among building owners, architects and engineers, state and local governments and utilities to reduce building energy consumption.

The U.S. government has been active in research and development of energy-efficient buildings since the 1970s. In 2006, the GSA reported that it would use only the U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System for assessing federal projects. By one account, as of 2018, the United States had decreased energy intensity in federal buildings by 50 percent since 1975. More recently, much is being accomplished through such programs as the Energy Department’s Better Buildings Initiative. And U.S. efforts are only part of a global push for green buildings, from China to Germany to Dubai, among many countries.

It has long been recognized that the climatic effects of reducing building energy use are potentially great. A 2008 report from the U.S. National Science and Technology Council claimed that even at that time, the technology existed to reduce energy consumption in new buildings by about 70 percent relative to conventional norms.

Since then, many more tools for significant energy-use reductions in buildings have been developed, and an international network of information-sharing about them has grown. Today there is widespread consensus that the historic energy and environmental effects of technologies such as air conditioning can be dramatically reduced via solutions that are technically possible, so that our future does not have to repeat our past. This goal is within reach if societies can sustain the political will to encourage their implementation. Technologies such as air conditioning have changed the terrain on which we do politics. We are in an era when politics can help to reshape energy-consuming technologies of the built environment to keep us, and the planet, cool.

Environmental groups have welcomed an announcement of six possible offshore wind energy locations, as the federal government attempts to boost the amount of renewables in the grid.

Climate Change Minister Chris Bowen proposed an area in the Bass Strait off Gippsland as a site for one offshore wind facility, along with parts of the Pacific near the Hunter and the Illawarra.

Further locations in the Southern Ocean near Portland, parts of the Bass Strait, and the Indian Ocean near Perth and Bunbury have also been flagged.

Mr Bowen said the new facilities would help the country reach 82 per cent renewable energy by the end of the decade.

“This is good news for these communities. A lot of jobs will also be created. These are areas undergoing economic change as our energy system transforms,” he told reporters in Sydney

“We are way behind the game, way behind the rest of the would in producing wind off our coastline.”

Mr Bowen said consultation for the offshore wind projects near Gippsland would begin straight away, while details for consultation at the other five sites would be announced in due course.

It’s estimated the Gippsland proposal would be enough to power 1.2 million homes in Victoria, with the industry set to create up to 8000 jobs a year once fully operational.

Senior researcher at the Climate Council, Tim Baxter, said the announcement of offshore wind represented a new frontier for Australian energy.

“While Europe takes great advantage of its offshore wind resources, foot dragging by the previous federal government means Australia – with world class offshore wind resources – still has no industry at all,” he said.

“Taking advantage of offshore wind brings many advantages to the grid, further improving the reliability of our power supply.”

The announcement comes a day after the government’s climate bill passed the House of Representatives.

The bill enshrined a 43 per cent reduction in emissions based on 2005 levels by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050.

It will now be sent to a Senate committee, due to report back by the end of the month, before being debated in the upper house.

The minister said the bill’s passage was a step forward and he looked forward to it passing the Senate.

“It is not symbolic, it is practice. There are 10 years of delay and dysfunction, this parliament is taking big steps for it to end,” Mr Bowen said .

“The passage of this bill sends a message to investors in renewable energy, transmission and storage around the world that Australia is open for business to become a renewable energy powerhouse.”

Opposition Leader Peter Dutton said while the coalition supported renewable energy, supply of power into the grid needed to be assured.

“We have got to do it in a way that doesn’t turn off the lights, and we are seeing in Germany and elsewhere at the moment where there is a rationing of power,” he told the Nine Network on Friday.

“If that happens here you will see manufacturing close up, jobs exported offshore and the emissions still going into the atmosphere.”

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said an “economy-wide transition” would be needed in order to cut down on Australia’s emissions.

He said more work was needed to be done to reduce emissions, particularly among the country’s biggest polluters.

“You have to have an economy-wide transition here. It will take effort. It’s not easy, but we can do it,” he told ABC Radio on Friday.

“And while doing it, we can create economic activity, create jobs, particularly in our regions.”

“Not just in energy projects … but also in my own portfolio area of infrastructure, because steel, concrete, high energy-intensive products … are involved in building our roads,” she told Sky News Australia.

“So when we legislate a target, what we’ve seen in other countries is it’s pushed out the timeframe for infrastructure development and in some cases cancelled projects.

Mr Sharma said when he was in the Liberal Party he argued for a “more ambitious” interim target of net zero by 2050.

“I don’t think the public is that interested in a debate about whether we do it two percentage points higher or two percentage points lower in 2030,” he told Sky News Australia.

“We’ve given business certainty now with the passage of this legislation, provided it goes through the Senate, I think we should just get on with it.”"

The ALP, the Greens and teal independents joined together on Thursday to pass a bill through the House of Representatives that enshrines in law the ALP’s campaign pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 to 43 per cent below 2005 levels.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said there was an “opportunity to end the climate wars”, the bitter battles between the Coalition and other parties – and within the Coalition – that have stymied effective action for a decade.

The bill’s target is clearly inadequate if Australia is to play its part in stopping the dangerous rise in global temperatures, already evident in events such as the unprecedented heatwaves and droughts in Europe this summer. But it is encouraging that the non-Coalition parties were willing to put aside their political interests and take a strategic approach.

Until a week ago, it was unclear if the Greens and the seven teal independents who all campaigned for faster action would endorse the bill. But they wisely chose to pass it rather than repeat the mistake in 2009 when fighting between the Greens and the ALP killed the first attempt at a carbon tax."
62d42913-2142-447c-ba5f-ac4cb11af60c,"This is despite conceding on their two key demands – that the 2030 emissions reduction target increase from 43 per cent over 2005 levels to 75 per cent; and the government slap a moratorium on all new oil and gas projects.

Labor stared down the Greens, saying the policy could be enacted without legislation.

Mr Bandt claimed as victories a ratchet mechanism to ensure the 43 per cent target could not go backwards, placing limits on the ability of government bodies such as Infrastructure Australia and the Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund to support new coal and gas; and greater transparency and integrity for the Climate Change Authority.

A spokesman for Mr Bandt said these were not inconsequential. Mr Marles’s comments underscore the tension between Labor and the Greens.

While the government was prepared to let the teal independents claim equally minor concessions as victories, so they retain their seats and keep the Liberals out of government, it is hostile to the Greens, which pose a direct threat to Labor from the left.

Mr Bandt says he will continue to fight new coal and gas developments by pushing for the insertion of a climate trigger in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, meaning the climate change impact of a proposal would become part of the environmental approval process.

The government will review the Act next year but is understood not to be keen on a climate trigger.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who is taking a week’s leave next week, also hit out at the Greens’ demand for a 75 per cent target by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2035.

“The difference between us and the Greens party is we have a path to get there. You can’t just transition an economy through rhetoric,” he said.

“You need to do it with coherent plans that make sure that you transition and grow the economy while you’re doing it because that is the way that you can bring the Australian people and communities with you as well.”

Mr Albanese rejected an assertion by the Grattan Institute energy expert Tony Wood that the legislated targets, which will require a safeguard mechanism to drive down the emissions of the nation’s 215 top emitters, was “a self-imposed constraint”.

Mr Albanese said “the good news is that the economy will grow during the process”.

Opposition leader Peter Dutton said legislating the targets was a “stunt” that would lock in higher energy process. He again pressed Labor to repeat its pre-election promise that power prices would drop by $275 by 2025 under its policy."
5fbeab12-9512-464f-a49d-c9b2ae0080c7,"Peter Dutton made a captain’s call in declaring the opposition would vote against the legislation. While most of his colleagues were so inclined, it was a poor precedent for the new leader to preempt this week’s party room discussion. In fact, it would have been better for the opposition to refrain from a stand, and just wave through the legislation. The government had a clear mandate for this policy, which was spelled out in detail well before the election. The Coalition’s opposition has exposed the unhappy position of the much-diminished Liberal moderates. Liberal MP Bridget Archer (back row, centre) crossed the floor to support the legislation. Credit:Alex Ellinghausen Tasmanian Liberal Bridget Archer crossed the floor to vote with Labor. Opposition Senate leader Simon Birmingham said if the 43 per cent target had required legislation, then “I would have wanted to vote for it in a heartbeat. However, it doesn’t require legislation”. This reasoning made no sense. The opposition has been left looking like a stranded asset on the climate issue, adrift from a pragmatic business community that wants to promote confidence. Anthony Albanese relished quoting what he described as “an alphabet soup” of business groups supporting “a vote for certainty”.

He hit where it hurt when he taunted the opposition about “what the business community are saying about them in private”. Loading The government, with a majority in the House of Representatives, did not need any crossbenchers to get its bill through. But, in a gesture, it accepted modest amendments from some of them. It was a sign of the government’s desire where possible to be inclusive towards the teals (“good manners” as well as “good government”, Climate Change Minister Bowen called it). The teals, incidentally, had met together to discuss their amendments. The climate vote was the culmination of what was, in legislative terms, a flying start for the government in its first parliamentary fortnight.

Albanese, anxious to reinforce the perception of momentum (that he had first generated on his overseas trips), piled the maximum number of bills into the parliament. Among them were his aged care reforms, that passed both houses. Also on the agenda, as a private member’s bill but facilitated by the government, was the removal of the ban on the ACT and Northern Territory legislating for voluntary assisted dying. This passed the lower house overwhelmingly, with both sides giving a conscience vote. It is set to go through the Senate in September. While it’s been a happy fortnight for the government on the legislative front, it was punctuated by a darker moment, when Treasurer Jim Chalmers delivered his sombre economic update to the house last week. Followed by Tuesday’s interest rate rise, the government can’t escape that the months ahead will become increasingly tough as cost of living increases bite deeply. The Albanese government’s early days have sent some signals about who has influence on it. Its determination to stare down the Greens was firm. On the other hand, we’ve seen its willingness to give concessions to the unions.

Labor’s policy to scrap the construction industry “watchdog”, the Australian Building and Construction Commission, was a well-known policy plank. It was more surprising, however, that Workplace Relations Minister Tony Burke acted so quickly to draw the ABCC’S teeth by regulation, well ahead of legislation being introduced later in the year. Even more unexpected – and highly questionable – has been the government’s intention to wind back the more detailed disclosure requirements the Morrison government introduced for superannuation funds. This can only be seen as a sop to industry funds, with no good argument that it is in the interests of fund members. “We’re learning from history”: Prime Minister Anthony Albanese at the Garma Festival over the weekend.

There he announced draft wording for his proposed constitutional amendment for an Indigenous “Voice” to parliament. Albanese has a deep commitment to achieving the Voice, commencing his election night victory speech with a pledge to “the Uluru Statement from the Heart in full”, and talking about it often since. One influence is his chief of staff Tim Gartrell, who a decade ago went to work for the Recognise campaign, under the auspices of Reconciliation Australia. Recognise aimed to raise awareness about constitutional reform, without committing to a specific model."
fbf56f12-39b0-4c32-bed7-bde367ad328a,"To the first major political interview of the day, and crossbench MP Dai Le has appeared on Nine’s Today show.

As some of you might know, the federal independent– who defeated Kristina Keneally in the race for the seat of Fowler at the recent election – abstained from voting on Labor’s signature climate legislation in the House of Representatives yesterday.

Here’s the first-term MP’s reasoning for that decision:

For me, I’m all for a greener and cleaner environment. The important issue that I raised was that there is no plan in the bills to talk about what [this] is going to cost, how it is going to add cost to ordinary Australians. As you know, I got elected to fight for, you know, the health of our community here, our electorate of Fowler. The cost of living. So I want to understand how [the bill] is going to impact [those issues].

There is no plan, in the bill, in terms of how to address the cost of living. You know, in today’s paper they talk about that renewables will obviously need to increase the capacity of the grid, which means it is going to cost our ordinary Australians money at the end of the day.

So it is very important that we actually understand what it’s going to cost to an electorate like mine in Fowler where our family income is 20 per cent less than the income of the rest of Australia. That’s why I’m really strong [on this]. I want to understand the cost of it in terms of the whole bill."

In its second week, the new House of Representatives has approved a 43 per cent target to cut greenhouse gas emissions, as promised by Labor when it went to the election. The Greens will back the bill when it goes to the Senate. The anxious observers of parliament – from environmental groups to business lobbies – seem to be airing a sigh of relief.

This is not the end of the climate wars. There cannot be an end to the political conflict on climate when the issue remains a source of debate and division in the community. Politics, after all, is about the resolution of conflict, which means conflict is part of the process.

But the thunder in the argument has eased. The achievement this week was the decision by a significant majority to ensure their divisions in parliament would not prevent a vote to get something done. For the first time, the national target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is being written into the law. Yes, this was only a limited agreement between Labor, the Greens and most of the crossbench. Yes, the Liberals and Nationals sidelined themselves by voting against a target that is only slightly higher than the 35 per cent cut they claimed they could deliver."

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the legislation would put Australia “on the right side of history.”

Australia is the third-largest fossil fuel exporter, after Saudi Arabia and Russia, and it has among the world's highest emissions per capita. Its previous government, under the center-right Liberal Party, resisted action to address climate change. Last year, at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, also known as COP26, Australia refused to join 39 countries that pledged to phase out financing for coal abroad, and it refused to join the more than 100 nations that promised to reduce methane emissions, even as other fossil fuel producers, including the United States and Canada, signed on to the pledges. Australia is already suffering the effects of climate change, however, including devastating brush fires and severe flooding from extreme rainfall events.

But in May, the center-left Labor Party — which had campaigned on proposed legislation like the new bill — won a majority in Parliament. With the support from the farther-left Australian Greens, the new government is expected to push the legislation through the Senate later this month. The Greens had initially proposed a 75% emissions cut by 2030, but reluctantly agreed to support the Labor bill as a first step toward more ambitious action.

“The impact of climate change is real. We need a response which is real,” Albanese told reporters on Thursday.

The passage of the climate bill in Parliament came on a day when Australia received some good news about the Great Barrier Reef, one of the world’s most fragile ecosystems. A report from the Australian government released on Thursday finds that parts of the reef now have the highest levels of coral cover seen there in decades.

In a boon to the future of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia’s new government announced Thursday it would stop development of a nearby coal mine due to the potential impact on the reef.

Australian Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek said government studies suggested mine sediments from the Central Queensland Coal Project would make their way into the ocean and damage the nearby reef.

“Based on the information available to me at this stage, I believe that the project would be likely to have unacceptable impacts to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, and the values of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area and National Heritage Place,” Plibersek said in a statement.

Famous for incubating a diverse array of plants and animals, the reef is the world’s largest coral ecosystem. It accounts for roughly 10% of the world's coral reef ecosystems and includes approximately 3,000 reefs, 600 continental islands and 300 coral cays. A popular spot for snorkeling and scuba diving, it accounts for 64,000 full-time jobs, according to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority.

Climate change and other consequences of human activity have severely damaged it in recent years. The reef “has lost half its coral cover, pollution has caused deadly starfish outbreaks, and global warming has produced horrific coral bleaching,” according to the World Wildlife Fund of Australia. Coral bleaching occurs when water gets too warm and corals expel the algae living in their tissues, causing the coral to turn completely white. The Great Barrier Reef has suffered four bleaching events since 2016.

“In the wake of the fourth mass bleaching event on the reef since 2016, it is vital new coal and gas projects like this one are refused,” Cherry Muddle, a Great Barrier Reef campaigner at the Australian Marine Conservation Society, told the Guardian.

But portions of the UNESCO heritage site increased coral cover in the last year, reaching levels not seen in 36 years of monitoring, according to the Australian Institute of Marine Science. Scientists surveyed 87 sites and found that northern and central parts of the reef had rebounded, thanks mainly to fast growth of a branching coral known as Acropora. The southern section of the reef is still losing coral cover, however.

Rising global temperatures due to the buildup of greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere continue to pose a threat to the reef, scientists say. And while Australia’s first government-wide action to address the problem is a notable step forward, its pledge of a 43% emissions cut still falls short of commitments from the United States and the European Union. The U.S. has pledged to reduce emissions by 50% from 2005 levels by 2030, and the EU has promised a 55% cut from 1990 levels.

“This is a good day for our country,” Climate Change Minister Chris Bowen told parliament.

ddd7ac16-be5a-49be-a395-527f7d20a8ce,"After a decade of climate policy failure, Wednesday brought good news and slightly less good news for Australian action on climate change.

The good news: the nation will soon have a substantive target for emissions reduction, after the Greens agreed to back the Labor government’s reduction of 43% by 2030.

The slightly less good news: the Coalition isn’t playing ball on climate. And as far as the Greens are concerned, the climate wars aren’t over at all.

That’s because the Greens – who now hold the balance of power in the Senate – see Labor as the largest remaining obstacle to climate action that aligns with the goals of the Paris Agreement. That goal: keep global warming under 1.5℃.

As Bandt told the National Press Club on Wednesday, Labor’s refusal to stop new coal and gas projects was “untenable” and the Greens will “pull every lever at our disposal” to force a ban. Expect to see the Greens causing headaches for Labor by making good on this promise. Bandt’s rhetoric yesterday made that clear:

“We will continue to fight individual projects around the country … I call on all Australians to join this battle. This battle to save our country, our communities and indeed our whole civilisation from the climate and environment crisis.”

The climate wars are not over – they’ve just changed form

So why did the Greens agree to back Labor’s climate change bill when the party wanted more? The reasons lie in recent political history.

The Greens copped huge criticism for blocking Labor’s last lukewarm climate policy, the Rudd government’s carbon pollution reduction scheme.

The Greens argued the scheme was full of holes. The Coalition also blocked the measure as part of its entrenched opposition to climate action. But rightly or wrongly, many see the Greens’ move as a strategic error that set climate action back by a decade.

For the record, the Greens – like the teal independents – are hardly being radical in pushing for stronger emissions targets. What the Greens want is a 75% emission reduction target by 2030, and no more new coal and gas projects.

The party believes it has a mandate, given 16 Greens were elected to parliament in May, up from 10 at the 2019 election. That’s not to mention the sudden appearance of the teals, who cut a swathe through the ranks of the climate-recalcitrant Coalition.

Whilst the Greens have publicly taken the fight to Labor over the emissions target, both Greens and teals have been negotiating with the government to ramp up the climate bill’s ambition.

Indeed it was independent Senator David Pocock who first suggested Labor’s target should be a “floor, not a ceiling and then ramping up ambition over time”.

Like the Greens, the teals have never seen this climate bill as job done. They, too, see it as just the beginning of the great decarbonising effort ahead. The Greens can ill-afford to cede them any credit for amending the bill.

That’s what lies behind the pragmatic declaration of support for the bill by Greens leader Adam Bandt in his National Press Club address on Wednesday.

This bill is only the start

The Dutton-led opposition will not support the bill and, rather unhelpfully, has indicated it will push to expand Australia’s nuclear industry instead. But the Greens backing of the bill means the Coalition’s position is irrelevant for now.

Bandt’s address made clear the Greens see themselves taking electoral ground from Labor at the next election by pursuing climate change and social welfare policy gains.

Indeed, Bandt poured scorn on the economic liberalism embraced by Labor since the days of Hawke and Keating, saying it damaged the environment and delivered massive social inequality.

As Bandt said yesterday, supporting the climate bill is only stage one. The Greens are bullish about what’s next, claiming a mandate from the planet and the laws of physics.

To give Labor credit where it’s due, stage one is still significant. This bill legitimates climate action and gives renewable investors confidence that the government actually wants change.

For their part, the teals believe the devil will be in the policy details. The Greens, too, will be keenly awaiting that.

So how will Labor respond? We can sense that already. Even before Bandt had finished speaking, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was batting away any Greens tinkering with the government’s soon to be revamped safeguard mechanism.

The government has also poured cold water on the Greens’ proposed climate trigger, which would more rigorously assess major projects for climate and environment impacts.

A new battleground

The Greens are treading a fine line. They want to push climate ambition upwards. But they must avoid repeating recent history.

This time around, it would be unthinkable for the Greens to sit with the Coalition in opposing climate action. It would cost them dearly in upcoming state elections, and probably cost them seats at the next election.

But the Greens still want to end Australia’s fossil fuel expansionism, and are prepared to take on the might of the fossil fuel industry. We’ve had the climate bill skirmish. But the battle is only just beginning.

3ec25f95-2198-4904-b806-d4ec4a8e3163,"The government is now assured it will secure its legislation to enshrine its 43% 2030 emissions reduction target, after Greens leader Adam Bandt pledged his party would support it in both houses.

The government has the numbers on its own in the House of Representatives. In the Senate, it only needs one more vote, apart from the Greens. It expects the vote of ACT crossbencher David Pocock. The bill will be voted on in the lower house this week and will go to the Senate next month.

Bandt’s announcement follows long negotiations with the government which, however, refused to budge on the minor party’s demand for a ban on new coal and gas mines.

The Greens’ decision came after it took two party room meetings to reach their position. Bandt said it was a “consensus” decision.

The government doesn’t require legislation to implement its policy, but has been anxious to put the target into law to send a strong signal including to prospective investors.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said after Bandt’s announcement that while the legislation wasn’t necessary, it “locks in” progress.

The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said the announcement “is in Australia’s national interest and will provide certainty for business”.

The opposition formally decided this week to vote against the legislation.

Bandt told the National Press Club that Labor’s refusal to stop new mines was “ultimately untenable”.

He said Labor might not get a United Nations climate summit, which it will be seeking, if it was willing to allow new projects.

“We will pull every lever at our disposal,” to make a ban happen, he said.

“Labor is set to undo parliament’s work by opening new coal and gas projects, unless we stop them,” Bandt said.

“Over the next six to 12 months the battle will be fought on a number of fronts. We will comb the entire budget for any public money, any subsidies, hand outs or concessions going to coal and gas corporations and amend the budget to remove them.

""We will push to ensure the safeguard mechanism safeguards our future by stopping new coal and gas projects. We will push for a climate trigger in our environment laws.

""We will continue to fight individual projects around the country, like Beetaloo, Scarborough and Barossa. I call on all Australians to join this battle. This battle to save our country, our communities and indeed our whole civilisation from the climate and environment crisis.”

Meanwhile, one of the Liberal moderates, Warren Entsch, has given strong support to the Coalition decision to inquire into nuclear power as a potential policy. Entsch told Sky that as coal went out of the system, we had to have “something to back up” renewable alternatives.

Territories legislation sails through lower house

Legislation to allow the ACT and the Northern Territory to make laws on voluntary assisted dying has passed the House of Representatives by 99 to 37.

MPs on both sides had a conscience vote. Leader of the House Tony Burke was among several Labor members to vote against the bill, which overturns a 1997 ban on the territories legislating for euthanasia. Liberal leader Peter Dutton and Nationals leader David Littleproud were both yes votes.

The bill will go to the Senate next month, where it is expected to pass.

UPDATE on climate bill – Liberal to cross floor

Tasmanian Liberal Bridget Archer told parliament late Wednesday that she will cross the floor and vote for Labor’s climate bill.

“At the end of the day, it’s important to me that when I am back in my own community, I am able to sincerely say that I used the opportunity afforded to me with the power of my vote, to stand up for what they want and need and to move on from this debate.”

She said she had had constructive discussions with Peter Dutton “about my views and that of the party on this issue.

""While there is much we do agree on, he understands why I have made this decision.

""I have respect for him and he has my support as our party formulates our own plan to combat climate change while supporting the Australian economy.

""However, while that happens, it is important that we do move forward and act now and not delay until the eve of the next election.”"

From the government’s side of the chamber, someone yelled: “Did he pay you to say that?”

In his first speech, Chandler-Mather said: “Technically, I should be kicked out of Parliament if I don’t dress like a businessman, but you’re more than welcome to vote for laws that materially benefit corporations that also happen to donate millions of dollars to your political party.”

Chandler-Mather’s question was about the effectiveness of Labor’s policy to build 4,000 social homes a year for five years given the waiting list sits at more than 160,000.

“Since 2018, the number has increased by 7600 homes a year on average,” Chandler-Mather said.

“Your housing Australia Future Fund promises to build just 4,000 social homes a year for five years.”

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese replied: “I indeed do understand the importance of having a secure roof over your head, and what that can do for the opportunity to advance in life. I know it because I have lived it. And that is one of the reasons why we went to the election with the substantial program, our housing Australia Future Fund, a $10 billion fund, the returns of which will be used to build around 30,000 social and affordable houses over the next five years.

d8a56982-93b6-4272-b01a-6376e1c37bd0,"Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese promised to end the country’s acrimonious climate wars when he was elected in May—ousting a government which had dragged its feet on taking meaningful action on climate change since coming to power in 2013.

He made an important step in the right direction on Aug. 4, when Australia’s House of Representatives passed legislation that will enshrine tougher emissions reductions targets when it passes the Senate, which is expected to happen in September. The new national target—a 43% cut in greenhouse gas emissions below 2005 levels by 2030—will be a step up from the previous conservative government’s target of between 26% and 28%. The law will also reaffirm the country’s commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050.

It’s the country’s most meaningful climate legislation in a decade—and the journey to get here has seen more than one prime minister ousted for attempting to take climate action. But climate advocates say that the new law will be just the beginning of a long fight to get the country—the world’s third largest exporter of fossil fuels—where it needs to be. This will be a “springboard for future action,” Amanda McKenzie, the CEO of the Climate Council, tells TIME. “This is the necessary first step,” she says, but “there is still a long way to go.”

The Fossil Fuel Question

It was clear from the start what the biggest hurdle would be to securing a strong climate proposal. Ahead of Australia’s climate bill being introduced to parliament in late July, Albanese said in a televised interview with the national broadcaster the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that the Labor Party, which Albanese leads, would not support a moratorium on fossil fuel projects because doing so would have a “devastating impact on the Australian economy.”

More from TIME

Australia produces 7% of all the world’s fossil fuel exports, ranking behind only Russia and Saudi Arabia. Environmentalists argue that the continued extraction of fossil fuels would undermine any target the country sets, and that Australia’s fossil fuel exports are a significant driver of global emissions. “The single biggest contribution Australia could make to stopping climate change would be to stop opening new coal and gas projects,” Adam Bandt, the leader of the Greens Party and a member of parliament, tells TIME.

After weeks of negotiations, which resulted in ensuring that the new targets are a floor not a ceiling, and allowing for ambition to be ratcheted up over time, Bandt announced his support for the legislation—which is key to its passage given the Greens hold the balance of power in the Senate. That’s despite the Greens’ inability during negotiations to include bans on new coal and gas projects in the legislation. But Bandt has vowed to find other ways to fight new fossil fuel projects. “Even just one big project would blow these weak targets out of the water,” he says.

There are 114 new coal and gas projects in Australia’s investment pipeline. That includes the controversial Scarborough gas project in Western Australia, which would produce liquified natural gas (LNG), much of which would be exported and burned in Asia. The project, led by Woodside Energy, is facing a public backlash—which has included online petitions and protests outside the company’s Perth offices—and a legal challenge from an environmental group which argues that burned fuel from the project would increase global temperatures and further damage Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, which has already been hit by climate-change induced bleaching. Activists say if the project goes ahead, burning the fuel unlocked from underground will release as much pollution as 20,000 flights around the world every day, for the next 25 years.

The Greens aren’t the only group in Australia fighting against new coal and gas projects. Many Indigenous Australians oppose new fossil fuel developments on their traditional land. A group of Indigenous Australians, for example, filed a lawsuit in June to try to stop Santos Ltd. from trying to develop a multi-billion dollar gas project off northern Australia.

Protest group Gamilaraay Next Generation organized a rally on Feb. 5, 2021, against Australian gas and mining company Santos. There is strong local opposition in Narrabri towards the Santos coal seam gas project, which is expected to include up to 850 new gas wells in and around the Pilliga Forest.

And six in ten Australians (63%) support introducing a ban on new coal mines opening in Australia, according to a 2022 poll by the Lowy Institute think tank, and the percentage of younger Australians that don’t want any new coal mines is even higher, at 70%. That sentiment was evident in the recent election, which delivered a stinging rebuke to the conservative Liberal Party—which pumped tens of millions of dollars into a “gas-led” recovery from the pandemic—and elected a record number of independent candidates who support tougher climate action (so-called “teal independents”), and members of the Greens Party. These climate-friendly politicians have promised to hold the Labor government accountable to take action, and their efforts were visible in negotiations over the climate bill. Before it was passed by the House of Representatives, the government agreed to add in several minor amendments to strengthen it.

“The Beginning of a Long Journey”

How Australia’s emissions targets will be implemented remains to be seen. The new climate bill, “sets a target, but it doesn’t actually tell us how we’re going to get there,” says Kate Chaney, an independent candidate who successfully rode the recent “greenslide” election wave to Australia’s House of Representatives.

Now attention will turn to the Labor Party’s broader climate policy package—including a $14 billion effort to modernize the grid, support for electric vehicles, and proposals to reform the existing Safeguard Mechanism, which in theory requires Australia’s largest polluters to keep their net emissions below a certain limit, but in practice hasn’t really worked. (Individual baselines are set in consultation with the polluting parties themselves and no company has ever been penalized for breaching its limit despite one in five fossil fuel companies significantly exceeding their approved emissions, according to the Climate Council.)

Details on many of these policies still need to be worked out, but the unprecedented number of climate-friendly politicians in parliament will likely continue to push the Labor Party on its policies, and drive other climate-related initiatives. Bandt of the Greens has promised to continue to fight new fossil fuel projects through a range of pathways—like the changes to the Safeguard Mechanism and by targeting fossil fuel subsidies in the budget. Fossil fuel subsidies stand at around $8 billion a year, according to the independent public policy think tank the Australia Institute. That means Australian taxpayers are subsidizing the fossil fuel emissions which are worsening the floods and bushfires that have increasingly devastated communities across the country in recent years.

Many teal independents may push the government on subsidies as well, along with focusing on areas such as strengthening environmental and conservation laws, and ensuring any future coal and gas developments are in line with the country’s emissions targets. “We work with the government as much as possible to hold them to account,” Chaney says.

There’s much work to be done, but pretty much everyone agrees that the country’s new climate bill is a step in the right direction. “On a pragmatic level, I backed these targets because you’ve got to lock in the progress where you see it,” says Chaney. “I think it’s the beginning of a long journey. It’s like turning a large vehicle around, you’ve got to start somewhere, but it’s gonna take a while.”

On Friday, the Met Office issued its first red warning for extreme heat, predicting a 50% chance of temperatures reaching 40C somewhere in the UK early next week.

Professor Hannah Cloke, climate expert and natural hazards lecturer at the University of Reading, said: “I think these types of temperatures will be seen more often which is very worrying because many people will die.

“This is a wake-up call for climate change.

“We are going to see these worsening hot summers but we can stop it getting really, really bad if we do something now.

“This cannot be reversed. We are locked into climate change and we need to work out what we are going to do about it.”

Prof Cloke said heatwaves were becoming more frequent, more intense and were lasting longer.

She said adaptations would need to be made to cope with rising temperatures.

“The UK Government does need to take it more seriously than they are doing,” she said.

“New houses should be set up to deal with this kind of heat when they are built.”

Prof Cloke warned health services could be overwhelmed during the heatwave and there would be risks such as heatstroke and dehydration for everyone, but particularly for the vulnerable and elderly.

Dr Mariam Zachariah, research associate at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College London, said a pattern of record temperatures in recent years showed the impact of climate change.

She said: “When the globe as a whole warms, heat extremes become frequent and we see more and more higher temperatures happening. This makes heatwaves more intense, prolonged and more frequent.”

Professor Ric Williams, research professor in ocean and climate sciences at the University of Liverpool, said: “If we want to minimise these extreme temperatures and reduce the frequency of them, the only way is to reduce our carbon footprint.

“We are moving in the right direction but could we be moving faster? Absolutely.”

At the Cop26 climate change conference last year a target to limit global warming climbing above 1.5C was agreed.

Dr Amanda Maycock, director of the Institute of Climate and Atmospheric Science at the University of Leeds, said: “We have got to continue on the path set out by Cop26 last year to stop temperatures rising even further.

“It is going to take time to happen and in the meantime what we need to see is more work towards adaptations and interventions so we can better cope with this kind of extreme event.

“This heatwave is a perfect example of the ways climate change is already affecting us today.

“Sometimes we view it as happening in the future and as something that will affect our grandchildren, but this reminds us very clearly that climate change is already happening, is already with us today and we are already experiencing the impacts.”

The Met Office said the likelihood of extremely hot days in the UK was increasing and would continue to do so during the course of the century.

Climate attribution scientist at the Met Office Dr Nikos Christidis said: “The chances of seeing 40C days in the UK could be as much as 10 times more likely in the current climate than under a natural climate unaffected by human influence.

“The likelihood of exceeding 40C anywhere in the UK in a given year has also been rapidly increasing, and, even with current pledges on emissions reductions, such extremes could be taking place every 15 years in the climate of 2100.”

It will take “decades” to fix the UK’s crumbling infrastructure for the climate emergency, a cabinet minister has warned, as the country braces for its hottest day ever.

The problems of rail lines buckling, overhead lines sagging and road tarmac melting will be repeated for many, many years to come, Grant Shapps said in a gloomy message to the public.

The transport secretary agreed the government received advance warning of the current heatwave – but argued it takes “decades to build and replace” the infrastructure affected.

“A lot of our infrastructure is just not built for these types of temperatures,” Mr Shapps said, adding: “And we’re going to see this a lot more regularly.

“We know that we’ve seen many of the hottest days ever recorded have come in the last 10 to 15 years. So we’re going to see this more – and it’s a huge infrastructure to replace.”

Asked, on Sky News, if “we are going to have this sort of problem for decades to come”, Mr Shapps replied: “We are. And ditto with things like tarmac on the roads.

“There’s a long process of replacing and upgrading it to withstand temperatures, either very hot or sometimes much colder than we used to – and these are the impacts of global warming.”

The rail network is only able to with stand temperatures of 35C – lower than Spain (45C) and Saudi Arabia (50C) – because heat above 40C “seemed impossible”.

“It has never been imagined that the UK would need it. Clearly we will do in the future,” Mr Shapps said.

The admission comes after a Cabinet Office minister declined to give evidence on adapting infrastructure for climate change – in what Labour branded the latest evidence of Boris Johnson’s “zombie government”.

Michael Ellis, who attends cabinet, cancelled his appearance before the Joint Committee on National Security Strategy with only a week’s notice.

The committee hit back by announcing there appeared to be no minister responsible for the strategy for climate resilience, which suggested a “major hole at the centre of government”.

Margaret Beckett, the senior Labour MP, said: “We’re rather shocked that the Cabinet Office decided they would not send a minister to give evidence on this topic.”

It suggested “there is not much happening in the Cabinet Office to address this very real risk to national security, or at least that the minister is not involved in it”, she said.

Roger Hargreaves, head of the Civil Contingencies Secretariat at the Cabinet Office, who stepped in for Ellis, said the minister is not responsible for co-ordinating policy for critical national infrastructure.

But, when asked by the former cabinet secretary Lord Butler if Mr Ellis has overall responsibility for resilience strategy, Mr Hargreaves replied: “Yes.”

A top UK scientist warned on Tuesday that the country could see brutal heat waves every few years if it doesn't take proper action to address climate change.

""I wasn't expecting to see this in my career, but the UK has just exceeded 40 degrees Celsius for the first time,"" Met Office Chief Scientist Stephen Belcher said in a video uploaded to the Met Office's Twitter. ""For me, it's a real reminder that the climate has changed, and it will continue to change.""

Belcher said research conducted at the Met Office, the UK's national weather service, shows it's ""virtually impossible"" to reach 40°C — or 104°F — in an ""undisrupted climate.""

""But climate change driven by greenhouse gases has made these extreme temperatures possible, and we're actually seeing that possibility now,"" Belcher said. ""If we continue under a high-emission scenario, we could continue to see temperatures like this every three years.""

Belcher said extreme temperatures will get worse in the future, adding that the ""only way to stabilize the climate"" is by reaching ""net-zero"" emissions — which means removing as much carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as people release into it, according to the World Economic Forum.

""The UK has already made strides in that direction already, but we want to stabilize the climate at a safe level, and that means reaching net zero soon,"" Belcher said.

According to documents reviewed by Insider, the UK government planned last year to reach net zero emissions by 2050. To do so, it seeks to support green jobs and clean energy options, an outline of the strategy reveals.

However, a top UK court on Monday ruled that the strategy lacks credibility and ordered lawmakers to present an updated plan by March 2023, the Financial Times reported.

Meanwhile, as London braved Tuesday's sweltering temperatures, Mayor Sadiq Khan warned there was a ""huge surge in fires"" across the city.

Officials also warned train riders not to travel by rail around London, while some airports were forced to delay flights."
6ec4aff3-92b0-4526-b1a2-03945fff0e12,"(Bloomberg) -- Temperatures in Britain surpassed 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) for the first-time ever, the latest grim reminder of the unfolding climate crisis in Europe.

London’s Heathrow airport hit 40.2 degrees Celsius at about 12:50 p.m. on Tuesday, according to the Met Office, which warned that temperatures would likely keep rising in many places. Cities and villages around the country are experiencing heat levels that would shatter the previous record of 38.7 degrees set on July 25, 2019.

“It’s a real reminder that the climate has changed and will continue to change,” Stephen Belcher, the Met’s chief of science and technology, said in a video posted on Twitter. “I wasn’t expecting to see this in my career.”

The impact has been evident across the country and beyond. Network Rail told passengers on Tuesday not to travel north out of London to a weather “red zone,” warning that rails could buckle under the brutal temperatures.

The current heat wave has sparked deadly wildfires in Spain, Portugal and France, adding to the challenges facing Europe from political upheaval to travel chaos and surging prices. Russia’s war in Ukraine provides a grim backdrop and increases anxiety about the weather’s impact on food production.

Power stations are operating at low levels to keep temperatures in check, while natural gas pipelines are limiting flows -- just as demand for energy to cool homes and offices rises.

The hot and dry conditions have caused an area roughly equivalent to the combined size of New York’s boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens to burn over the past 10 days, while more than 600 people have died across the region.

Increasingly frequent and intense heat waves are the result of climate change, and temperatures this extreme are set to become more common as the world continues to burn fossil fuels.

Story continues

Brutal conditions have already struck India, the U.S. and western Europe this year, but pose a particular challenge to regions unaccustomed to scorching temperatures like the UK. Ireland also posted its highest temperature in more than a century on Monday.

Here’s a roundup of some of the countries hit hardest in Europe’s current heat wave:

UK

Britain’s network operator said it measured rail temperatures of 62 degrees Celsius in Suffolk on Monday and said tracks could “expand, bend and break” under the stress of the extreme conditions.

The train issues spilled over to the struggling aviation sector with services to London’s Luton and Gatwick airports canceled on Tuesday. Flights were operating normally at Luton after being suspended Monday for repairs when the heat lifted a section of the runway.

At Gatwick, additional inspections were being made to check the state of the runway and the surface was also regularly watered, a standard procedure in high temperatures, according to a spokesman.

Transport for London told people not to travel and suffered severe delays due to heat-related restrictions on a number of lines of the London Tube, including the Central and District lines. The Hammersmith & City line was suspended entirely because of heat.

Daily life has been disrupted across usually temperate Britain. The Met Office issued its first ever red emergency warning for extreme heat for Monday and Tuesday, warning of the potential for power outages, road closures and even loss of life. It has also extended its most severe warning for the risk of fires over most of England Tuesday.

Temperatures should start to ease later Tuesday as cooler weather moves in from the west. The biggest relief should come Wednesday evening when temperatures drop to the low 20s Celsius -- around average for the season.

France

Forest fires continued to rage in southwestern France on Tuesday, with Paris set to exceed 40 degrees Celsius.

More than 34,000 people have been evacuated from their homes in the past week in the Gironde region where 19,300 hectares have burned so far, according to regional authorities. Hundreds of animals had to be moved to safety as flames came closer to a zoo in Bassin d’Arcachon, near the Atlantic coast.

Authorities warned there was a high risk of further fires in the southeast of the country later this week with the expected arrival of the Mistral wind in the Rhone valley.

Among places that saw record temperatures at the start of the week, Brest, on the tip of Brittany on the northwestern coast, smashed a previous high of 35.1 Celsius, reaching 39.3 degrees on Monday, according to Meteo France.

Italy

Amid an extreme drought -- which has caused the Po river to drop to its lowest level in 70 years -- officials are warning of risks to food production.

“Water for agriculture is running out,” Attilio Fontana, governor of Lombardy region around Milan, told Italian news agency Ansa. While the Maggiore, Garda and Como lakes still have some reserves, farms may be cut off “if rain doesn’t fall in coming days.”

Italy’s health ministry said at least nine Italian cities, including Rome and Florence, will be on “red alert” on Wednesday, with temperatures regarded as a serious threat to the health of the entire population and not merely of the most vulnerable.

Volunteers from the Progetto Arca foundation are monitoring the streets of Milan, Rome, Naples, Bari, Turin and Varese with mobile kitchens to bring fresh water and nutritious meals to homeless and vulnerable residents. Anti-heat kits include personal hygiene products, fresh and clean changes.

Netherlands

Dutch supermarket chain Albert Heijn said it will cancel all grocery deliveries from 2 p.m. local time Tuesday because of expected high temperatures.

The company doesn’t “consider it responsible to let our delivery workers work in these weather conditions,” a spokesperson told Bloomberg. The company, owned by Ahold Delhaize, said the normal delivery schedule will resume Wednesday.

The Netherlands’s meteorology institute declared code orange, warning the southern and central parts of the country “will be very hot.” Amsterdam is forecast to hit 37 degrees Celsius on Tuesday.

Spain

Spain’s state-owned train operator Renfe interrupted the fast train service between Madrid and the northwestern region of Galicia as fires burnt close to the rails. Some frightened passengers trapped in a train captured footage that became viral on social media.

Over 30 fires are still burning in Spain, 20 of which remain out of control. Firefighters were able to contain some of the worst blazes in the Extremadura region, but most of the country remains on high or very extreme wildfire alert, according to Europe’s Earth observation agency Copernicus.

A total of 134,168 hectares of land have burnt this year in Spain, according to Copernicus data through July 16. That’s more than six times the average for the past 16 years.

Portugal

Two elderly people were found dead inside a burnt car in the area of one of the large fires in northern Portugal, according to news agency Lusa. The country has suffered over 200 more deaths than normal since the start of the latest heat wave.

But there are signs of progress. The wildfires have eased since last week. Still, as of 8 a.m. on Tuesday there were two large blazes in the north of the country, with almost 800 firefighters seeking to contain them.

As the UK braces for summer temperatures approaching 40C, the Met Office has issued its first ever red warning for large parts of England on Monday and Tuesday, cautioning the public that the heat is likely to be so severe that it could cause “serious illness or danger to life”.

The UK Health Security Agency has likewise declared a Level 4 national emergency, its equivalent notification, warning that the high temperatures could mean “illness and death may occur among the fit and healthy”.

Britain’s transport infrastructure, health service, utilities and supply sector could all be impacted as a consequence of the sweltering conditions, which threaten to melt tarmac, cause railway tracks to buckle or warp and leave reservoirs running low.

“We’ve just issued a red warning for extreme heat for Monday and Tuesday which is the first such warning ever issued,” said Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge, explaining its move.

“The warning covers an area from London up to Manchester and then up to the Vale of York. This is potentially a very serious situation.""

Paul Gundersen, the institution’s chief meteorologist elaborated: “Exceptional, perhaps record-breaking temperatures are likely early next week, quite widely across the red warning area on Monday, and focused a little more east and north on Tuesday.

“Currently there is a 50 per cent chance we could see temperatures top 40C and 80 per cent we will see a new maximum temperature reached.

“Nights are also likely to be exceptionally warm, especially in urban areas. This is likely to lead to widespread impacts on people and infrastructure. Therefore, it is important people plan for the heat and consider changing their routines. This level of heat can have adverse health effects.”

The red warning is published in full on the Met Office UK’s weather warnings dashboard, which forecasts: “An exceptional hot spell on Monday and Tuesday leading to widespread impacts on people and infrastructure.”

The Met Office warns Britons to expect:

Population-wide adverse health effects experienced, not limited to those most vulnerable to extreme heat, leading to serious illness or danger to life. Government advice is that 999 services should be used in emergencies only; seek advice from 111 if you need non-emergency health advice.

Substantial changes in working practices and daily routines will be required

High risk of failure of heat-sensitive systems and equipment, potentially leading to localised loss of power and other essential services, such as water or mobile phone services

Significantly more people visiting coastal areas, lakes and rivers, leading to an increased risk of water safety incidents

Delays on roads and road closures, along with delays and cancellations to rail and air travel, with significant welfare issues for those who experience even moderate delays

Some schools in England have already indicated they will close on Monday and possibly if the weather threatens to put too great a strain on pupils and threaten their wellbeing.

Vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, have meanwhile been warned to take care, stay in the shade and drink plenty of water.

If temperatures were to pass 40C, it would beat the current record for this country, which stands at 38.7C and was recorded at Cambridge Botanic Garden on 25 July in 2019."

A British ice cream cone manufacturer has had to lay on extra deliveries to deal with demand, as the popularity of the frozen treat soars in the extremely high temperatures.

Antonelli, producer of the only waffle cones to be made in the UK as well as ice-cream ingredients and decorations, said smaller, independent ice cream parlours have been asking for last-minute deliveries as they struggle to cope with demand.

National sales manager Gary Brooks told the PA news agency: “Manufacturers of ice cream, from small, independent parlours who make their own to bigger people, they’ll all look at the weather, and it’s the smaller ones that tend to get caught out a little bit because they’re never going to put as much stock down as, say, a Wall’s or something like that.”

He added: “They will look at the weather and go ‘Oh crikey, we’re gonna get wiped out in the next…’ so then they come to us and they need a delivery, like, tomorrow.

“That’s the biggest thing that affects us. is that people want that delivery instantly.”

“I mean, we have people (saying) ‘I need it next day’, ‘I need it on a Saturday’, we don’t normally do Saturdays.”

The Manchester-based company keenly monitors the Met Office forecasts in advance to ensure they have enough supply, but they have nonetheless needed to adapt to the current climate.

Mr Brooks said: “We’re expecting a busy time in the summer anyway just because of the nature of the business – but when you get a weather surge like this, we will see that our stocks that were maybe planned in for August and September selling will get depleted.”

He added: “Obviously we’ve known about this weather for a couple of weeks, because we’re looking at the long-term.

“We keep our eye on the weather all the time, because we know that it makes a massive difference in this industry. And as soon as the sun comes out, it’s a different business altogether. So, we will have to react production-wise, definitely.”

Asked about whether the hot temperatures were a boost to sales, he said: “The staycation was a massive thing for this industry last year because people remembered about Britain’s holiday (industry) and on British holidays, you eat ice cream. So that, and then a nice surge in weather now.

“It’s prolonged weather that really takes its toll. A short surge like this, it’s not a problem at all. If this carries on for three to four weeks, then we will be looking at that now and just trying to gauge what’s going to happen.

“Of course, we get very good at weather watching.”

Supermarket chain Iceland said it saw its best ever day for ice cream sales on Saturday, beating the previous record set in summer 2019 by as much as 12%.

The most popular ice cream product was the chain’s own brand strawberry and vanilla cones."

According to Health Secretary Steve Barclay, extra measures are being implemented for ambulance services nationwide.

Londoners Urged Not to Travel on Monday and Tuesday Due to Extreme Heat

Expected high temperatures have prompted Londoners to be urged against travelling on Monday and Tuesday.

The current heatwave is set to peak on Tuesday, with an 80 percent chance of the mercury topping the UK’s record temperature of 38.7C (101.7F) set in Cambridge in 2019.

Transport for London (TfL) is advising passengers to only travel for “essential journeys.”

The firm’s chief operating officer Andy Lord said: “Due to the exceptionally hot weather that is expected next week, customers should only use London’s transport network for essential journeys.

“If customers do need to travel, they should check before they travel as we are expecting there to be some impact to Tube and rail services as a result of temporary speed restrictions we will need to introduce to keep everyone safe,” he added.

“It is also vital that customers always carry water at all times with them when travelling.”

The Met Office has issued an amber warning for heat covering much of England and Wales from Sunday until Tuesday.

There is a 50 percent chance of temperatures reaching 40C somewhere in the UK, likely along the A1 corridor, with the Met Office also issuing its first red warning for extreme heat.

Very hot temperatures can affect rails, overhead power lines, and signalling equipment, with TfL saying it will work hard to keep as many services running as possible using “enhanced” inspections to mitigate the impact of the heat.

Track temperature checks will continue to be carried out regularly across the Tube and rail networks to ensure they remain safe and that the track is not at risk of bending or buckling, TfL said in a statement.

It added it was also inspecting the air conditioning units on the trains that cover 40 percent of the Tube network, the trains on the Elizabeth Line and London Overground as well as the air cooling units on double-deck buses to ensure they are functioning well.

TfL also has response teams standing by on its rail and road network to deal with any issues as they occur, with a particular focus on stalled trains and times, crowding and customer advice."

London is predicted to be hotter than the Caribbean, the Western Sahara and popular holiday destinations in Europe as temperatures soar.

The Met Office has forecast the capital could see highs of 38C when the heatwave sweeps across England.

The rise in temperatures has forced the UK Health Security Agency to issue a level 4 heat-health alert – described as an “emergency” – while the Met Office has issued the UK’s first red extreme heat warning, with both running from Monday to Wednesday.

The capital’s scorching temperatures mean it will be warmer than Nassau in the Bahamas (32C), Kingston in Jamaica (33C), Malaga in Spain (28C), Athens in Greece (35C), Albufeira in Portugal (28C) and Dakhla, in the Western Sahara (24C).

Other areas of England will also experience hotter weather than the holiday destinations, with the Midlands predicted to see highs of 37C, East Anglia with 36C and the North West and North East with 33C.

It comes as new records were broken in Wales and Northern Ireland on Sunday.

Hawarden, a village in northern Wales, reached 33C while Armagh in Northern Ireland was 27.7C.

Tuesday is meanwhile predicted to be even hotter, with temperatures possibly reaching 40C – a new record for England.

Scientists at the Met Office have said the 40C prediction is a result of climate change, warning that the 40C figure “could be as much as 10 times more likely in the current climate than under a natural climate unaffected by human influence”.

Some schools in several counties, including Nottinghamshire and Hampshire, have confirmed they will close, while train companies urged people not to travel on Monday and Tuesday.

Network Rail will close the East Coast Main Line between noon and 8pm on Tuesday for all locations between London King’s Cross and York and Leeds, with passengers warned not to travel.

Sam MacDougall, operations director for Network Rail said: “Closing the line to traffic is always a last resort but it is the right thing to do to keep people safe on Tuesday given the unprecedented heatwave forecast.

“The forecast temperatures are well above those which our infrastructure is designed for, and safety must come first.”

Additional contingency support for ambulance services, such as more call handlers and extra working hours, have been put in place while the chairman of the NHS Confederation said hospitals are going to be “really, really pushed” over the next few days.

Britons are being urged to stay inside during the hottest points of the day, between 11am and 4pm, and wear sun cream, a hat, stay in the shade and keep hydrated with water.

Emergency services have also urged people to be cautious when cooling off after the body of a boy was recovered in Salford Quays, Greater Manchester, in the early hours of Sunday morning.

A search is meanwhile under way after reports of concern were made for a man seen in a river in Northumberland on Sunday.

A North East Ambulance Service spokesperson said: “We were called at 4.12pm this afternoon to reports of concerns for someone in the water off Piper Road in Ovingham.

“We currently have seven resources on scene but are currently unable to provide any further information.”"

Ministers will hold an emergency Cobra meeting on Saturday after meteorologists warned of record high temperatures in England that could put lives at risk.

Cabinet Office minister Kit Malthouse is to chair a meeting of the Government’s Cobra civil contingencies committee to discuss the escalating heatwave, a Government spokesman said.

It will be the second Cobra meeting Mr Malthouse has led on the issue.

Meteorologists have given an 80% chance of the mercury topping the UK’s record temperature of 38.7C set in Cambridge in 2019, with the current heatwave set to peak on Tuesday.

Following the issuing of the Met Office’s first red warning for extreme heat, covering a swathe of England from London to Manchester and York on Monday and Tuesday, its chief executive Penny Endersby said people can find it hard to to know what to expect when “climate change has driven such unprecedented severe weather events”.

“Here in the UK we’re used to treating a hot spell as a chance to go and play in the sun,” she added.

“This is not that sort of weather.”

Temperatures will climb over the weekend, and the Met Office has also issued an amber warning for heat covering all of England, southern Scotland and Wales from Sunday until Tuesday.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan held a special meeting with key senior officials from agencies including the NHS, the Met Police, London Fire Brigade, London Ambulance Service, councils and Transport for London on Friday to ensure there is a robust plan in place to deal with the level four heat alert.

Mr Khan has urged Londoners to undertake only essential travel on Monday and Tuesday and to prepare for disruption because speed restrictions will be in place on rail and Tube networks.

A high air pollution alert for London has also been issued by the mayor for Monday.

Labour meanwhile criticised Prime Minister Boris Johnson after reports said he had failed to attend Cobra meetings.

Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said: “Boris Johnson has gone missing in action again. He’s back to his old tricks of skipping important Cobra meetings.

“Where’s the plan for the delivery of essential services and how people will be kept safe at work, on transport, in schools, hospitals and care homes?

“The public will have no confidence in this zombie Conservative government responding swiftly and decisively to this national emergency as this disgraced Prime Minister prepares to party while Britain boils.”

Daytime temperatures on Saturday are predicted to be around 27C in London, 26C in Cardiff, 23C in Belfast and 21C in Edinburgh.

On Sunday, it could reach 30C in the capital, 27C in Cardiff, 24C in Belfast and 23C in Edinburgh.

Temperatures are forecast to increase by several more degrees on Tuesday – up to the mid-30s for much of England and Wales.

There is a 50% chance of temperatures reaching 40C somewhere in the UK, likely along the A1 corridor which runs from London to Scotland through counties including Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Yorkshire and the North East, with the Met Office issuing its first ever red warning for extreme heat.

The UK Health Security Agency has increased its heat health warning from level three to level four – a “national emergency”.

Level four is reached “when a heatwave is so severe and/or prolonged that its effects extend outside the health and social care system… At this level, illness and death may occur among the fit and healthy, and not just in high-risk groups,” it said.

Temperatures are expected to be especially high in London and the south of the UK (Dominic Lipinski/PA). (PA Wire)

Britons have meanwhile been scrambling to buy fans and looser clothing to help them keep cool during the heatwave.

Retailer Toolstation said sales of fans have risen by 641% over the last week compared with the week before as tradespeople struggle to stay cool.

The company also said sales of builders’ shorts have increased by 50% and t-shirts by 35%.

Fire brigades, including South Wales Fire And Rescue Service, Scottish Fire And Rescue and London Fire Brigade, have issued safety warnings, urging people to act responsibly.

They warn people to disposing of barbecues, lit cigarettes and glass bottles responsibly, to not burn any rubbish such as garden waste and use local authority services instead, and that barbecues should not be used on balconies or near sheds, fences, trees, shrubs and garden waste to avoid anything catching alight.

They also urge people who are cooling off in waterways to be aware of cold-water shock."

Health chiefs fear the NHS will be overwhelmed by a number of heat-related casualties if the mercury does indeed rise to levels only usually seen in Death Valley in California, the world's hottest place.

Tuesday is likely to be the hottest day, with the potential to top the UK record temperature of 38.7C (101.7F) set in Cambridge in 2019, forecasters said.

The Met Office warning says the weather could cause health problems across the population, not just among people vulnerable to extreme heat, leading to potentially serious illness or danger to life.

Climate change lecturer John Grant told the Mirror: 'I think hundreds are going to die in the UK if not ­thousands, that's my fear if we hit temperatures of 40C.

'It's terrifying what will happen if we don't have a management plan and get cooling centres ready.'

Meanwhile, schools are also taking steps to try and protect pupils in the harsh conditions - with some encouraging wearing t-shirt and shorts and others axing sports days and offering the chance for parents to keep their children home altogether.

The Hereford Academy in Herefordshire has announced an earlier start and finish to the school day to try and beat the worst of the heat.

A message on its Facebook page read: 'Due to the high temperatures due to hit next week, we will have an earlier condensed format for our final four days: Finishing earlier but starting earlier thus being away for the hottest part of the day.'

Elsewhere in the same county, a letter to parents of children at Marlbrook, Little Dewchurch and St Partin's Primary School warned PE lessons will be scrapped and pupils won't be allowed outside to play.

It added: 'We are also giving parents the option to keep children at home on Monday.'

Meanwhile, Crestwood Community School in Eastleigh, Hampshire, said it was cancelling its sports day as 'we do not feel that it is safe for students to be out in the heat all day, taking part in physical activity.'

And in east London, the head teacher of Clapton Girls' Academy warned of an early finish amid fears the school's facilities won't be able to cope with the soaring temperatures.

Anna Feltham told parents: 'Already, many classrooms are very hot, even with fans, and students are struggling to keep cool, drink enough water and maintain concentration in lessons.

'Next week's heatwave will make many teaching rooms unbearably hot by lesson 4 and 5. We have reviewed a number of options but do not have sufficient 'cool' rooms to re-room lessons into.'

Before that, however, Friday will begin with outbreaks of showery rain moving south-east across northern and central areas of the UK.

Meanwhile, people in the South and South West can expect warm sunshine. London is forecast to experience 26C on Friday, while 23C is predicted for Cardiff, 20C in Belfast and 19C in Edinburgh.

Saturday is also set to start with overcast skies and scattered showers in northern areas, before turning dry across the nation as the extreme heat moves in.

During the peak of the heatwave on Tuesday, 36C is predicted in the capital, 28C in Cardiff, 26C in Belfast and 25C in Edinburgh, but some meteorologists believe it could even rise to an unprecedented 40C.

Cabinet Office minister Kit Malthouse has said the Government is preparing for a 'surge' in demand on the NHS and other services due to the expected heatwave.

After chairing a meeting of the Cobra civil contingencies committee in Whitehall, Mr Malthouse urged the public to look out for people who were particularly vulnerable in the heat.

Elsewhere, Avanti West Coast has warned passengers who wish to use services between London Euston and Scotland to plan ahead due to the impact of the heat on rail lines.

The company said that weekend services may be cancelled at short notice while journeys on Monday and Tuesday will be subject to amended timetables."

UK Met Office Issues First Red Warning for Extreme Heat

The UK’s Met Office has issued its first ever red warning for extreme heat, as it warned of a “potentially very serious situation” in parts of England that could pose a risk to life.

During the ongoing heatwave that is set to peak on Tuesday, the Met Office said, there is an 80 percent chance of the mercury topping the UK’s record temperature of 38.7C (101.7F) set in Cambridge in 2019, and there is a 50 percent chance of temperatures reaching 40C somewhere in the UK.

The red warning, the first of its kind ever issued, covers an area from London up to Manchester and then up to the Vale of York, said Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge, adding: “This is potentially a very serious situation.”

Penny Endersby, Met Office chief executive, said in a sombre video shared online: “The extreme heat that we’re forecasting right now is absolutely unprecedented.”

“Stay out of the sun, keep your home cool, think about adjusting your plans for the warning period,” she said.

‘National Emergency’

The UK Health Security Agency has increased its heat health warning from level three to level four, which indicates the situation amounts to a “national emergency.”

Level four is reached “when a heatwave is so severe and/or prolonged that its effects extend outside the health and social care system… At this level, illness and death may occur among the fit and healthy, and not just in high-risk groups,” it said.

England’s chief medical officer, Professor Sir Chris Whitty, asked people on Twitter to look out for each other.

He said: “Please remember the signs of heat exhaustion and heatstroke especially for older and medically vulnerable people. Early intervention to cool people down and rehydrate them can be lifesaving.”

A Number 10 spokesman said railway speed restrictions may be needed on “some parts of the network next week to manage the hot weather and to avoid any potential damage.”

Network Rail has warned people to travel only if absolutely necessary amid the high temperatures forecast on Monday and Tuesday.

Meanwhile, motorists have been advised to try to make their journeys outside of the hottest periods of the day, particularly if they have older cars.

Tim Doran, from the RNLI Water Safety Team said the service was anticipating a “busy weekend” for its lifeboat crews and lifeguards.

“If you are planning on going to the beach, we would encourage you to visit a lifeguarded beach and swim between the red and yellow flags,” he said.

Commuters face another day of chaos on London’s transport network as the UK is gripped by a blistering heatwave.

Already there are ‘severe delays’ on the Central, District and Metropolitan lines, the latter of which has been part suspended.

Meanwhile there is already no service at all on the Hammersmith & City Line due to ‘heat related speed restrictions’.

Transport for London (TfL) has warned tracks could be at risk of bending or buckling due to the unusually hot weather sweeping the capital.

Overhead power lines could also be affected, so to help the system cope, trains will be running more slowly and less frequently on lines that are still open.

TfL has announced minor delays on the London Overground, which has been part suspended due to the heatwave.

Travellers can also expect minor delays on the Elizabeth Line, as well as the Jubilee and Piccadilly lines.

Meanwhile the concourse of Kings Cross station was left deserted this morning as the display board was full of cancelled services.

The first ever ‘red warning’ for extreme heat has been issued by the Met Office, with temperatures set to exceed 40°C today and beat the UK’s record.

Last night was the UK’s hottest on record, with temperatures staying above 25°C in some places, including in the capital.

Londoners have been warned to only make essential journeys.

Andy Lord, the chief operating officer of Transport for London said: ‘Due to the exceptionally hot weather that is expected next week, customers should only use London’s transport network for essential journeys.

‘If customers do need to travel, they should check before they travel as we are expecting there to be some impact to Tube and rail services as a result of temporary speed restrictions we will need to introduce to keep everyone safe.’

Anyone who does travel is advised to wear cool clothes, take a handheld fan and ensure you have plenty of water.

Train riders in the UK have been warned not to travel into the ""red zone"" around London amid a record-breaking heatwave that can cause railway tracks to buckle in the scorching temperatures.

Britain's Network Rail advised travelers to stay home instead of riding the railways as temperatures in the UK on Tuesday shattered records, reaching a high of 104.36 degrees Fahrenheit (40.2 degrees Celsius) for the first time ever.

""Temperatures are still climbing in many places,"" the UK's Met Office warned in a tweet.

Network Rail tweeted that the company and train operators ""have upgraded travel advice for services heading north out of London into the weather warning 'red zone' to DO NOT TRAVEL.""

""With free refunds/ticket swaps available, the advice is to stay home and replan your journey,"" the company said.

The company said on Monday that services ""were heavily impacted by the extreme heat today with buckled rails reported and overhead wire systems failing.""

The railway company's hottest track recorded on Monday was 62 degrees Celsius, or 143.6 degrees Fahrenheit, in the county of Suffolk.

""Rail temperature can be about 20°C higher than air temperature, causing it to expand, bend and break,"" Network Rail said.

Additionally, speed restrictions for trains across the area have been put in place to help prevent the steel tracks from buckling.

The UK issued its first ""red extreme heat"" warning zone around London this week.

The ""red extreme heat"" weather warning was issued for Monday and Tuesday for parts of central, northern, eastern, and southeastern England."

Rail passengers face widespread train cancellations and delayed journeys as operators prepare for expected extreme temperatures.

Dozens of early long-distance trains were axed on Monday morning – with the unprecedented closure of a key inter-city line set for Tuesday.

Passengers in England and Wales are being warned not to travel unless absolutely necessary. With many services cancelled, travellers who do attempts journeys are warned to expect crowded and delayed trains.

In extreme heat, steel rails are susceptible to buckling. To reduce the stress on the rails, the normal running speed of 125mph is reduced to 90mph or 60mph, with some stretches – typically in sheltered, south facing, “sun trap” locations – as slow as 20mph.

At the neighbouring stations of King’s Cross and St Pancras International in central London, some departures on the East Coast main line to Leeds and York were cancelled as LNER – the main train operator to Yorkshire, Tyneside and Scotland – thinned out services.

On Tuesday afternoon and early evening, no trains will run at all.

LNER’s managing director David Horne, tweeted: “Our trains will run at a reduced speed of 60mph between York and London this afternoon. Please only travel if necessary and thank you for your patience if your journey takes longer than usual.

“The rail industry has taken the very difficult decision to close the East Coast main line between York/Leeds and London on Tuesday 19 July when temperatures are due to peak at 39C.

“I’m sorry if this will disrupt your journey plans but the safety of everyone must come first.”

Lumo, the rival train operator between London and Edinburgh, is running some services only between Newcastle and the Scottish capital. Grand Central, which links Wearside and West Yorkshire with King’s Cross, says: “Only a couple of our services are running in each direction.”

Passengers with tickets for travel on Monday or Tuesday can use their tickets later in the week or claim a full refund.

At St Pancras International, East Midlands Railway has cancelled at least half of its inter-city links from Sheffield, Derby, Nottingham and Leicester to London St Pancras. The first arrival from Sheffield ran 15 minutes late due to speed restrictions.

Early international trains to and from Paris on Eurostar were delayed by an hour due to overhead power supply problems near the French capital. The Channel Tunnel train operator says, despite the heat: “Eurostar trains are currently expected to operate as normal.”

Avanti West Coast is cancelling many trains from Birmingham and Manchester to London.

GWR is halving frequencies from London Paddington to Cardiff and Bristol.

The train operator says: “Customers who choose to travel despite the warning are being advised to check their journeys before travelling and ensure they are well-prepared for the extreme conditions – wearing cool clothes, taking handheld fans and ensuring they have plenty of water to drink.

“Vulnerable passengers and those with health conditions should avoid travelling on these days.”

With the highest temperature expected on Tuesday, line closures are expected in northern England. Northern Trains says: “Some routes will be closed completely, especially on Tuesday in the North East, Yorkshire and Humber and you should not attempt to travel as there will be no alternative options.”

All London Underground lines are operating a reduced service.

The AA is warning motorists of melting roads and potential blowouts – and says a car’s interior can reach 60C.

“Those in older cars not recently serviced, without air conditioning, are advised to consider whether they should be travelling at all,” says the organisation.

Setting off as early in the morning as possible can reduce the chances of your engine overheating as the air temperature is reduced at this time of the day. Road surfaces are also likely to be cooler – meaning that your car’s tyres are less likely to reach temperatures high enough for pressures to increase.

There is a greater danger of tyre blow-outs in extreme temperatures.

In case of breakdown carry plenty of water – at least one litre per person travelling.

Last summer the AA attended an average of two cases per day where children or pets had been accidentally locked in cars – along with the keys."

Expected extreme temperatures have prompted Londoners to be urged against travelling on Monday and Tuesday.

The current heatwave is set to peak on Tuesday, with an 80% chance of the mercury topping the UK’s record temperature of 38.7C (101.7F) set in Cambridge in 2019.

Transport for London (TfL) is advising passengers to only travel for “essential journeys”.

The firm’s chief operating officer Andy Lord said: “Due to the exceptionally hot weather that is expected next week, customers should only use London’s transport network for essential journeys.

“If customers do need to travel, they should check before they travel as we are expecting there to be some impact to Tube and rail services as a result of temporary speed restrictions we will need to introduce to keep everyone safe,” he added.

“It is also vital that customers always carry water at all times with them when travelling.”

The Met Office has issued an amber warning for heat covering much of England and Wales from Sunday until Tuesday.

There is a 50% chance of temperatures reaching 40C somewhere in the UK, likely along the A1 corridor, with the Met Office also issuing its first red warning for extreme heat.

Very hot temperatures can affect rails, overhead power lines and signalling equipment, with TfL saying it will work hard to keep as many services running as possible using “enhanced” inspections to mitigate the impact of the extreme weather.

Track temperature checks will continue to be carried out regularly across the Tube and rail networks to ensure they remain safe and that the track is not at risk of bending or buckling, TfL said in a statement.

It added it was also inspecting the air conditioning units on the trains that cover 40% of the Tube network, the trains on the Elizabeth Line and London Overground as well as the air cooling units on double-deck buses to ensure they are functioning well.

TfL also has response teams standing by on its rail and road network to deal with any issues as they occur, with a particular focus on stalled trains and times, crowding and customer advice."

The Met Office issued its most severe warning for next week, with temperatures set to rise above 35 degrees Celsius (95 Fahrenheit) in parts of England, including London, and possibly threatening national records exceeding 40 degrees. The red alert, with potential power outages, canceled flights and posing a danger to life, was triggered for the first time and is in place for Monday and Tuesday.

The government held an emergency Cobra meeting on Saturday, chaired by Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Kit Malthouse rather than Prime Minister Boris Johnson, to work out contingency plans for the nation’s schools, emergency services and transport networks. Ministers will meet again Monday."

9b2c135a-d0ac-4530-a908-795434e6642a,"Britain shattered its record for highest temperature ever registered Tuesday amid a heat wave that has seared swaths of Europe – and the national weather forecaster predicted it would get hotter still in a country ill prepared for such extremes.

The typically temperate nation was just the latest to be walloped by unusually hot, dry weather that has triggered wildfires from Portugal to the Balkans and led to hundreds of heat-related deaths. Images of flames racing toward a French beach and Britons sweltering – even at the seaside – have driven home concerns about climate change.

The U.K. Met Office registered a provisional reading of 40.2 degrees Celsius (104.4 degrees Fahrenheit) at Heathrow Airport in early afternoon – breaking the record set just an hour earlier and with hours of intense sunshine still to go. Before Tuesday, the highest temperature recorded in Britain was 38.7 C (101.7 F), set in 2019.

As the nation watched the mercury rise with a combination of horror and fascination, the forecaster warned temperatures could go higher still.

The sweltering weather has disrupted travel, health care, and schools in a country not prepared for such extremes. Many homes, small businesses and even public buildings, including hospitals, don’t even have air conditioning, a reflection of how unusual such heat is in the country better known for rain and mild temperatures.

The intense heat since Monday has damaged the runway at London’s Luton airport, forcing it to shut for several hours, and warped a main road in eastern England, leaving it looking like a “skatepark,” police said. Major train stations were shut or near-empty on Tuesday, as trains were canceled or ran at low speeds out of concern rails could buckle.

Electric fans cooled the traditional mounted troops of the Household Cavalry as they stood guard in central London in heavy ceremonial uniforms. Other guards reduced their duties. The capital’s Hyde Park, normally busy with walkers, was eerily quiet – except for the long lines to take a dip in the Serpentine lake.

“I’m going to my office because it is nice and cool,’’ said geologist Tom Elliott after taking a swim. “I’m cycling around instead of taking the Tube.’’

Queen Elizabeth II carried on working. The 96-year-old monarch held a virtual audience with new U.S. ambassador Jane Hartley from the safety of inside Windsor Castle.

A huge chunk of England, from London in the south to Manchester and Leeds in the north, remained under the country’s first “red” warning for extreme heat Tuesday, meaning there is danger of death even for healthy people.

Such dangers could be seen in Britain and around Europe. At least six people were reported to have drowned across the U.K. in rivers, lakes and reservoirs while trying to cool off. Meanwhile, nearly 750 heat-related deaths have been reported in Spain and neighboring Portugal in the heat wave there.

The highest temperature previously recorded in Britain was 38.7 C (101.7 F), a record set in 2019. Tuesday’s reading was provisional, which means they are produced as near to real time as possible with final readings issued after data quality-control, the Met Office said.

Climate experts warn that global warming has increased the frequency of extreme weather events, with studies showing that the likelihood of temperatures in the U.K. reaching 40 C (104 F) is now 10 times higher than in the pre-industrial era.

The head of the U.N. weather agency expressed hope that the heat gripping Europe would serve as a “wake-up call” for governments to do more on climate change.

“I hope that also in democratic countries, these kind of events will have an impact on voting behavior,” World Meteorological Organization Secretary-General Petteri Taalas told reporters Tuesday in Geneva.

Combatting climate change head on is the only solution for Britain, said Professor Myles Allen, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford, because continually refurbishing the country’s infrastructure to cope will be “extremely expensive.”

“We cannot afford to live in an ever-changing climate,” he told the BBC. “We have to stop this, turn this around.”

Drought and heat waves tied to climate change have also made wildfires harder to fight.

In the Gironde region of southwestern France, ferocious wildfires continued to spread through tinder-dry pines forests, frustrating firefighting efforts by more than 2,000 firefighters and water-bombing planes.

Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated from homes and summer vacation spots since the fires broke out July 12, Gironde authorities said.

A smaller third fire broke out late Monday in the Medoc wine region north of Bordeaux, further taxing firefighting resources. Five camping sites went up in flames in the Atlantic coast beach zone where blazes raged around the Arcachon maritime basin famous for its oysters and resorts.

But weather forecasts offered some consolation, with temperatures expected to ease along the Atlantic seaboard Tuesday and the possibility of rains rolling in late in the day.

Temperatures are set to rise by another 10C in much of England over the coming days, increasing the strain on hospital and train services.

On average, the mercury will remain in the mid-20s for the last working day of the week, before rising to around 35C (95F) in southern, central and eastern areas of England by Tuesday.

Hospital and train services are already under pressure from the heat, with the NHS facing a “surge” in demand from heat-related admissions, and Avanti West Coast has warned their services may be cancelled at the last minute.

The Met Office has issued an “amber” extreme heat warning for much of England and Wales from Sunday until Tuesday.

Tuesday is likely to be the hottest day, with the potential to top the UK record temperature of 38.7C (101.7F) set in Cambridge in 2019, forecasters said.

The warning says the weather could cause health problems across the population, not just among people vulnerable to extreme heat, leading to potentially serious illness or danger to life.

Friday will begin with outbreaks of showery rain moving south-east across northern and central areas of the UK.

Meanwhile, people in the South and South West can expect warm sunshine.

London is forecast to experience 26C on Friday, while 23C is predicted for Cardiff, 20C in Belfast and 19C in Edinburgh.

Saturday is also set to start with overcast skies and scattered showers in northern areas, before turning dry across the nation as the extreme heat moves in.

During the peak of the heatwave on Tuesday, 36C is predicted in the capital, 28C in Cardiff, 26C in Belfast and 25C in Edinburgh.

Cabinet Office minister Kit Malthouse has said the Government is preparing for a “surge” in demand on the NHS and other services due to the expected heatwave.

After chairing a meeting of the Cobra civil contingencies committee in Whitehall, Mr Malthouse urged the public to look out for people who were particularly vulnerable in the heat.

Avanti West Coast has warned passengers who wish to use services between London Euston and Scotland to plan ahead due to the impact of the heat on rail lines.

The company said that weekend services may be cancelled at short notice while journeys on Monday and Tuesday will be subject to amended timetables."

A health boss has warned that the forecast for high temperatures could result in people dying, while Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said people should be resilient enough to “enjoy the sunshine”.

College of Paramedics chief executive Tracy Nicholls said the “ferocious heat” the UK is predicted to experience over the next few days could have a detrimental effect on Britons.

Scorching temperatures are predicted for Monday, with Peterborough expected to hit 37C and Milton Keynes, Norwich and Lincoln set to see 36C – while temperatures could rise to 40C in London on Tuesday.

Climate attribution scientist at the Met Office Dr Nikos Christidis said the 40C prediction is a result of climate change.

The forecaster has issued an amber warning for the majority of England on Sunday, which then extends to southern Scotland and Wales from Monday until Tuesday.

The UK’s first red extreme heat warning has also been issued by the Met Office across a large part of England from London to Manchester and York on Monday and Tuesday.

The UK Health Security Agency has also issued a heat health warning at level four, which is described as a “national emergency”.

Ms Nicholls told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge On Sunday programme: “This isn’t like a lovely hot day where we can put a bit of sunscreen on, go out and enjoy a swim and a meal outside.

“This is serious heat that could actually, ultimately, end in people’s deaths because it is so ferocious. We’re just not set up for that sort of heat in this country.”

Her comments were made after Mr Raab said people should take precautions ahead of the record-breaking temperatures but added that they should be able to enjoy themselves.

“Obviously there is some common-sense practical advice we are talking about – stay hydrated, stay out of the sun at the hottest times, wear sun cream – those sorts of things,” he told Sophy Ridge On Sunday.

“We ought to enjoy the sunshine and actually we ought to be resilient enough through some of the pressures it will place.”

Ministers held a virtual emergency Cobra meeting on Saturday after meteorologists warned the record high temperatures could put lives at risk.

Additional contingency support for ambulance services, such as more call handlers and extra working hours, have been put in place on Monday and Tuesday.

Transport services are expected to be disrupted on both days, with Cabinet Office Minister Kit Malthouse urging people not to travel.

Avanti West Coast, Transport for London and London North Eastern Railway are also urging passengers not to travel unless it is absolutely necessary.

Meanwhile, the chairman of the NHS Confederation said hospitals are going to be “really, really pushed” over the next few days.

Lord Victor Adebowale said the NHS “will cope”, but added that “coping isn’t good enough”.

He told Times Radio: “My members are pretty stretched at the moment. Ambulances are operating at their peak, the waiting times for ambulances are now getting longer.

“The NHS will cope but coping isn’t good enough. We need to be actually operating in a way that allows people to get the treatment they need wherever needed, in good time. And that’s a struggle.”

Schools in several counties, including Nottinghamshire and Hampshire, have confirmed they will close on Monday and Tuesday following the health warnings, while Milton Keynes University Hospital is “standing down routine outpatient appointments and surgery” on those days.

Greater Manchester Police implored people to avoid cooling off in reservoirs, rivers or ponds after a teenage boy died while swimming with friends in a canal.

The 16-year-old got into difficulties and was last seen struggling in the water at Salford Quays in Greater Manchester at around 6.15pm on Saturday.

Britain is set to swelter in 40°C heat today and Tuesday, with the Met Office issuing the first ever Red warning for exceptional heat.

If you’re wondering what is causing all this heat, the culprit is a high pressure system called the ‘Azores High’.

This system which usually sits off Spain, has grown larger and pushed farther north, bringing high temperatures to the UK, France and the Iberian peninsula.

Heating from greenhouse gases caused by human activity is causing wind patterns to change and the tropics to expand, including the dry zones.

#Heatwave2022 continues with a a very warm start Monday, temperatures rising rapidly under strong sunshine throughout the morning, reaching into the mid to high thirties for many.



Stay #WeatherAware â ï¸ pic.twitter.com/9r9rRvONoD — Met Office (@metoffice) July 17, 2022

The Azores High pressure system is one such dry zone which has expanded to unprecedented levels in the past 1,200 years, according to a recent study in Nature Geoscience.

However, heatwaves need a number of atmospherical factors to be in place. In order for the air for be dragged up from the south, there needs to be high and low pressures in the right places.

Current conditions make it ideal for the heat coming in from the Sahara in north Africa which travels further north through Spain, France and then into the UK.

The Met Office has said that the UK will cool a little in the middle of the week as cooler air pushes down from the north, although southern England will still have temperatures in the high 20s.

After this, winds are expected to turn southerly, bringing hot air up from north Africa and the Sahara.

It’s the first time the country is witnessing tempratures so high. A red warning is issued when there is a danger to life when unprecedented highs of more than 40°C could be seen in central England. That is hotter than many parts of the Sahara Desert will be.

Sadly, this looks like it will just be the first of many heatwaves in the future. 40°C heatwaves in the UK are ‘ten times more likely now due to climate change’.

The Met Office has said that by 2100, even with current pledges to reduce emissions this would reduce to just every 15 years.

But just why is the country in the midst of such a sweltering heatwave?

Experts say it is due to a number of factors, including winds blowing hot air up from north Africa and the Sahara, the 'Azores High' subtropical pressure system creeping farther north, and the ongoing impacts of climate change.

It has led to the Met Office issuing a red extreme heat warning for much of England today and tomorrow, with health officials declaring a 'national emergency'.

There are fears hospitals will be overwhelmed, schools could be forced to close, and transport links may grind to a halt due to train cancellations and melted roads.

London is set to be one of the hottest places in the world, as temperatures soar above those in the Western Sahara and the Caribbean. The current highest temperature in the UK is 38.7°C (101.7°F), recorded in Cambridge in 2019.

Part of the reason behind the hot weather is that a pressure system called the Azores High, which usually sits off Spain, has grown larger and is being pushed northwards.

This has brought scorching temperatures to the UK, France and the Iberian peninsula.

The high pressure near the southern half of Britain, which has been responsible for the recent warm weather, is also continuing to dominate overhead.

When this develops it triggers heatwaves, which can also bring so-called 'tropical nights' — when night-time temperatures fail to drop below 68°F (20°C).

These heatwaves are becoming more likely and more intense because of climate change.

Meanwhile, winds turned southerly at the end of last week, bringing hot air up from north Africa and the Sahara and allowing the UK to tap into some of the 113°F (45°C) heat from Spain and France.

Why is it so hot? Experts say it is due to a number of factors, including winds blowing hot air up from north Africa and the Sahara, the 'Azores High' subtropical pressure system creeping farther north, and the ongoing impacts of climate change.

WHAT ARE THE MAIN AIR MASSES SWIRLING ABOVE BRITAIN? There are five main air masses above Britain, along with a sixth one that is a variation of one of them. The UK is more likely to get maritime air masses because our weather primarily comes from the west. The reason for this is because of the direction the Earth spins, leading us to experience prevailing westerly winds. Although Britain does get air masses arriving from the east, too, they're not as common, forecasters say. Polar Maritime Arriving from Greenland and the Arctic Sea, it brings wet and cold air that leads to chilly and showery weather. Arctic Maritime As its name suggests, this air mass comes from the Arctic. It brings with it wet and cold air that causes snowfall in the winter. Polar Continental When the Beast from the East struck Britain in 2018, the bone-chilling air was Polar Continental and came from Siberia. It brings hot air in the summer and cold in the winter, leading to dry summers and snowy winters. Tropical Continental Everybody's favourite summer air mass, the Tropical Continental is what gives us heatwaves and bags of sunshine. The air is hot and dry and comes from North Africa. Tropical Maritime Arriving from the Atlantic Ocean, this warm and moist air brings cloud, rain and mild temperatures to the UK. Returning Polar Maritime The returning Polar Maritime is a variation of the Polar Maritime. However, it takes the air first southwards over the north Atlantic, then north-eastwards across the UK. During its passage south, the air becomes unstable and moist but on moving north-east it passes over cooler water, making it more stable. It brings largely dry weather and cloud. Advertisement !- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/au/sciencetech/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - ->

This Tropical Continental air mass is one of five that battle for supremacy over Britain and is what gives us heatwaves and bags of sunshine.

Professor Hannah Cloke, natural hazards researcher at the University of Reading, said: 'We have had heatwaves in the UK before, but the intensity of heat that has been forecast, which will either break UK records or at least get very close, is enough to kill people and animals, damage property, and hobble the economy.'

Dr Mark McCarthy, head of the Met Office National Climate Information Centre, said: 'The highest temperatures experienced in the UK tend to occur when our weather is influenced by air masses from continental Europe or North Africa.

'There is already a strongly-embedded warming due to climate change across the continent, that is increasing the likelihood of challenging the existing UK temperature record.'

The 'Azores High', which is undergoing 'unprecedented' changes, is also a big contributor to the current hot weather in Britain.

A new study suggests the atmospheric high-pressure system is being driven by climate change and already causing droughts in parts of Portugal and Spain.

The Azores High rotates clockwise over parts of the North Atlantic and has a major effect on weather and long-term climate trends in western Europe.

Researchers say this system 'has changed dramatically in the past century and that these changes in North Atlantic climate are unprecedented within the past millennium'.

Using climate model simulations over the last 1,200 years, experts from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution found that the Azores High started to grow to cover a greater area around 200 years ago, as human greenhouse gas pollution began to increase.

It expanded even more dramatically in the 20th century, in step with global warming.

Now the high pressure system, which is usually above the Atlantic and about 1,000 miles from mainland Portugal, has grown larger and pushed farther north, bringing high temperatures to the UK.

'We anticipate that the area of high pressure over the Azores will increasingly extend towards the southwest of the UK,' Daniel Rudman, of the Met Office, has said.

'This will lead to a good deal of warmer and mostly dry weather, especially across the south, although it may also bring cloud and rain into the northwest at times.'

Meanwhile, long July days and short nights also mean that strong sunshine builds up high temperatures.

Professor Richard Allan, professor of climate science at the University of Reading, said: 'Summer heatwaves in the UK are usually caused by an extended period of dry, sunny conditions, usually associated with high pressure that snuffs out cloud formation.

'Because there is little soil moisture, the sun's energy heats the ground and the air above rather than being used up evaporating water.

'These conditions can be intensified by hot, arid winds blowing from continental Europe where heat and drought have been building over the summer.'

He added: 'Higher temperatures and drier soils due to human caused climate change are turning strong heatwaves into extreme or even unprecedented heatwaves.'

Britain has been slowly getting hotter since the 19th Century, with the 10 hottest years since 1884 all having occurred since 2002.

In the past three decades alone, the UK has become 1.62°F (0.9°C) warmer.

'We hoped we wouldn't get to this situation but for the first time ever we are forecasting greater than 40°C in the UK,' said Met Office scientist Dr Nikos Christidis.

'In a recent study we found that the likelihood of extremely hot days in the UK has been increasing and will continue to do so during the course of the century, with the most extreme temperatures expected to be observed in the southeast of England.

'Climate change has already influenced the likelihood of temperature extremes in the UK.'

The UK had its ninth hottest summer on record last year and the hottest since 2018, with an average temperature of 15.28°C (59.5°F). The graphic above shows which areas of Britain had higher than average summer temperatures compared to the average from 1981-2010

Which weather will we get? There are five main air masses that battle it out above Britain. They include the Polar Maritime, Arctic Maritime, Polar Continental, Tropical Continental and Tropical Maritime. A sixth air mass, known as the returning Polar Maritime, also affects the UK

He added: 'The chances of seeing 40°C days in the UK could be as much as 10 times more likely in the current climate than under a natural climate unaffected by human influence.

'The likelihood of exceeding 40°C anywhere in the UK in a given year has also been rapidly increasing, and, even with current pledges on emissions reductions, such extremes could be taking place every 15 years in the climate of 2100.'

Extreme heat events do occur in natural climate variation due to changes in global weather patterns, the Met Office said.

But it added that the increase in the frequency, duration, and intensity of these events over recent decades is clearly linked to the observed warming of the planet and can be attributed to human activity.

The chances of seeing 106°F (40°C) days in the UK could be as much as 10 times more likely in the current climate than under a natural climate unaffected by human influence, experts say.

Professor Cloke described the red warning for extreme heat as a 'wake-up call' about the climate emergency.

'Even as a climate scientist who studies this stuff, this is scary. This feels real. At the start of last week I was worried about my goldfish getting too hot. Now I'm worried about the survival of my family and my neighbours,' she said.

Why IS the British weather so changeable? UK is 'unique' because FIVE air masses battle for supremacy above it, bringing an extraordinary mix of atmospheric conditions that lead to sun one minute and rain the next

Warm and sunny one minute, rain the next, sometimes the British weather can be so wildly changeable it's difficult to keep up.

But just why is it so variable and prone to change from day to day? Or even, much to the frustration of those who have forgotten a coat, hour by hour?

And has climate change affected it?

MailOnline spoke to several meteorologists about what makes the UK's weather so 'unique', as one put it, and whether any other country in the world compares.

At the heart of it are five main air masses that each have similar temperature and moisture properties. They battle for supremacy above Britain and can spark an extraordinary mix of atmospheric conditions when they clash.

'The UK doesn't have its own weather,' said Met Office forecaster Aidan McGivern, 'it borrows it from elsewhere.'

'That is what the air masses are — large bodies of air that come from other places.'

These graphics show the amount of rain and duration of sunshine areas of Britain had last summer as a percentage of the average from 1981-2010. Northern, central and western parts of the UK had less rainfall compared to the average, while some of the south had more. Southern areas also had less sunshine, while northern parts including Scotland had more

WHAT IS THE JET STREAM AND HOW DOES THAT AFFECT BRITAIN'S WEATHER? The jet stream is a fast moving strip of air high up in the atmosphere that's responsible for steering weather systems towards the UK from the Atlantic. It has a warm side to the south and a cold side to the north and can have a major impact on what kind of weather we experience. In a typical British summer, when temperatures are warmer and drier, the jet stream is to the north of the UK, where it pulls up hot air across the country. However, in the winter it sits further south and brings wet and windier weather because low pressure areas come closer to the UK. The jet stream, which sits at about 30,000ft, can also change shape, going from flat to amplified, and it's the latter that can lead to huge thunderstorms developing very quickly.

Professor Liz Bentley, CEO of the Royal Meteorological Society, said: 'When two air masses are next to each other that is when we get dramatic weather conditions.

'Air masses are dependent on wind direction; if coming from the continent they are continental, from the north they are polar, from the ocean it's maritime and from the south they're tropical.'

They include the Polar Maritime, Arctic Maritime, Polar Continental, Tropical Continental and Tropical Maritime. A sixth air mass, known as the returning Polar Maritime, is also seen above Britain and is a variation of the Polar Maritime.

Each air mass brings a different type of weather, but as they meet and battle it out, it's the one that wins which dictates if we get warm sunshine, freezing rain or a spectacular thunderstorm.

'We mainly get the maritime air, either Tropical Maritime, Polar Maritime or returning Polar Maritime, because of how the Earth spins, leading to prevailing westerly winds for the UK,' Mr McGivern said.

Professor Bentley added: 'Although all the air masses have a role to play, the prevailing wind direction for us is westerly so we tend to see more coming from the Atlantic.

'The time of year doesn't affect which air mass wins, but when one does, it depends what season we're in as to what weather we get.

'In the winter, air from the continent is very cold. That's why we had the Beast from the East in 2018 — because freezing air was coming from Siberia.

'However, in the summer, when the Tropical Continental air mass is more common, the air is warm because it's coming from a very hot continent, so you're likely to get heatwaves.'

Although it might not always seem it, heatwaves in Britain are actually becoming much more common.

'We are seeing climate change in the UK,' said Professor Bentley. 'There has been an increase in temperatures — the average monthly temperature has increased by 1°C (1.8°F) in the last 30 years.

'Temperature records are being broken more regularly and we're also more likely to see heatwaves that last longer and are more intense.'

So is the British weather only going to get more unpredictable?

'It's becoming more volatile, more intense,' said Professor Bentley. 'It's a much more volatile situation than three or four decades ago.

'Sometimes we even get two or three seasons in one day.

The graphic above shows how the jet stream works and where it's located between seasons

'We've also seen increases in rainfall, particularly intense rainfall that can lead to flash floods, which is another effect of climate change in the UK.

'And the Met Office has said in a report that we are likely to see 40°C (104°F) recorded in the UK within the next decade.'

Some of the cold and dreary weather can often be brought by the Polar Maritime, but it is not just about the air masses — the jet stream at 30,000ft also plays its part.

This is a fast moving strip of air high up in the atmosphere that's responsible for steering weather systems towards the UK from the Atlantic.

It has a warm side to the south and a cold side to the north. In a typical British summer, when temperatures are warmer and drier, the jet stream is to the north of the UK, where it pulls up hot air across the country.

However, in the winter it sits further south and brings wet and windier weather because low pressure areas come closer to the UK.

The jet stream can also change shape, going from flat to amplified, and it's the latter that can lead to huge thunderstorms developing very quickly."
