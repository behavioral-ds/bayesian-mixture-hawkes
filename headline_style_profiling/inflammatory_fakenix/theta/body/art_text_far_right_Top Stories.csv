A cop who specializes in child sex crime has gone viral after sharing the strict rules she has for her own kids in order to keep them safe from pedophiles.

Terra Avilla, who goes by the user name thegirlcop on TikTok, regularly shares informative content relating to child abuse and domestic violence.

But the mom of three’s latest advice really got people talking, as she detailed the five things her kids are banned from doing for their own protection over two videos.

Avilla, who is based in Connecticut, said while some of the tips might be “surprising,” they were based on years of on-the-job experience.

And as a result, her top rule was to forbid her kids from attending sleepovers.

“I get a lot of hate for this,” she said in her first video, but explained the popular activity was not worth the risk.

“You don’t know who’s there, or who could slip in during the night,” she added.

Number two was barring her kids from using Snapchat, given the high number of predators that use the popular app to prey on young victims.

She also revealed the app was especially risky as a users location can be viewed, and because children mistakenly believed photos sent over the platform would be permanently deleted.

“Nothing good comes from this app,” was her bleak assessment of Snapchat.

Thirdly, the officer said she never forces her children to hug and kiss anybody – including family and friends.

She said it was important that children understand only they can consent to physical contact.

“I know that sounds really mean but it’s their body and if they don’t want to give a hug goodbye then they have the right to do that and to set boundaries,” she said.

The first three rules attracted an outpouring of interest, inspiring her to share a follow up clip.

In the second video, she said secrets were outlawed in her household.

“There’s a big difference between having a secret and keeping a surprise. Kids need to learn that an outside adult shouldn’t be telling a child to keep a secret,” she said, but added the caveat that it was acceptable to keep a secret for a friend if it would keep them safe from harm.

And lastly, she said she won’t allow her children to use “silly names for their private parts,” insisting they use the correct anatomical terms.

That way, it’s easier to explain a situation to authorities if something does ever go wrong.

The videos were flooded with comments, with countless parents expressing their gratitude for the safety list.

“Pediatric ER doctor child safety expert and mum here, and I agree with every part of this,” one TikTok user wrote, while another added: “I feel the same about sleepovers, never gonna happen.”"

The earthquake measured a magnitude of 7.3 on the Richter scale which is classified as a major event and can cause damage to buildings which may collapse. With a quake of such magnitude, the effects may be felt up to 155 miles away from the epicentre.

The epicentre has been identified in the Solomon Sea, 58km (36 miles) southwest of Honiaram, Solomon Islands. With a depth reported by Volcano Discovery of up to 10km (6.2 miles), severe shaking was experienced at the epicentre. Following the tremor, US Tsunami Warning System has warned of a potential tsunami threat at the Solomon Islands.

Location of earthquake

#UPDATE A strong 7.0 magnitude earthquake has struck the Solomon Islands, with eyewitnesses reporting violent shaking that hurled items to the ground and knocked out power in parts of the capital Honiara.

The tsunami warning was issued at 2:10am (UTC). The warning said that “hazardous tsunami waves [are] possible for coasts within 300 km of the quake epicentre”. According to SBS News, the Met Service for the Solomon Islands has since removed the tsunami warning. READ MORE: Prince Andrew and Harry will not stand in for King Charles

While it is thought that there are now no tsunami threats, it is warned that there will be “unusual sea currents” following the earthquake. Residents of the Solomon Islands have been urged to move to higher ground by the office of the Prime Minister. However, the office of the Prime Minister noted that there has been no severe damage to buildings in Honiara, the capital. The quake near Malango saw people report severe and violent shaking which knocked televisions and other household items onto the ground. DON'T MISS:

a4a58485-dceb-4ed4-8fd1-268e9efd3867,"Drivers using one of Brisbane, Australia’s busiest roads over the weekend were left gobsmacked by a huge billboard displaying the home page of a porn website.

The crude scene on Milton Road was visible for more than three minutes on Sunday morning before being shut down by the owner of the billboard.

Cyber-hackers have been blamed for the rogue display, with the company saying it has handed over footage and images of individuals to police.

The billboard operates on a road travelled by parents dropping children at nearby Milton State School.

“At 9.23am [Sunday] morning, a single digital LED screen began to show inappropriate content of a pornographic nature,” the company said in a statement.

“The transmission of this material ran for between a number of seconds and up to 3½ minutes.”

No other goa billboards were affected by the breach, nor was the company’s security system, the company said.

The police, according to goa managing director Chris Tyquin, were treating the incident as a “serious matter”.

Mr Tyquin said the company had not received any threats and it was currently unaware of the hackers’ motives.

He added the company regretted the display may have been offensive and distressing to members of the public, particularly children.

“As a family-owned business that has operated in Brisbane for in excess of 50 years, no manner or format of pornography is acceptable,” the company said.

“This attack on one of our LED screens was irresponsible, deliberate and malicious We

hope that Queensland Police can help bring the perpetrators to justice

“A crisis meeting involving senior management and relevant staff began immediately

as we became aware of this breach and is focused on the security across our entire

network. Further security measures began to be implemented last night.

“All other screens have been reconfirmed to be physically intact. Further, all

monitoring equipment of each site are working to expectations.”

An image of the billboard was shared to social media on Monday morning where it has since attracted a huge reaction.

Respondents were particularly concerned by the glaring cybersecurity issues in Australia, given recent major data breaches at Optus and Medibank.

“It’s genuinely depressing how bad data security is, even at the companies that try to do it right,” one person responded.

“People should not be subjected to seeing porn without their consent. If you walked up to a kid at the bus stop down from this billboard and showed them the same image you would be up for pedo charges, this is no different. I hope they are found and charged,” another said.

“I don’t think it’s funny to put porn up there – and quite dumb as well, as they’re now doubly offending. At least for the hack you can claim ‘ethical hacking’ and *maybe* get away with it when found out. For putting porn on a billboard, you might be in less easily avoidable trouble,” a third wrote."

The orange cat was discovered at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport on Tuesday morning after an agent spotted some orange hair poking out of the zipper of the suitcase.

A spokesperson for the Transportation Security Administration told The Post that the traveler was not aware that he had a cat in his luggage.

TSA spokesperson Lisa Farbstein said in a statement that the agent was “shocked” by the furry discovery in the luggage, which had been checked in and X-rayed.

“Traveler said the cat belonged to someone else in his household,” Farbstein explained.

In a picture accompanying the tweet, tufts of ginger fur were poking out of the black suitcase between the gaps of the orange zipper, which had come undone.

“We’re letting the cat out of the bag on a hiss-toric find,” the agency wrote on Twitter. “This CATch had our baggage screening officers @JFKairport saying, ‘Come on meow’! Feline like you have travel questions reach out to our furiends @AskTSA. They’re available every day, from 8 a.m. – 6 p.m. (ET).”

Farbstein confirmed the cat didn’t belong to the traveler but was now back where it belonged: “On the bright side, the cat’s out of the bag and safely back home,” she joked.

Meanwhile, when tracked down by The Post, the kitty’s owner said the furball — named “Smells” — must have crawled into their house guest’s bag while she was at work. She didn’t realize the orange tabby was missing until she got a ring from an airport official.

The traveler was reportedly shocked after the cat was discovered in the luggage. TSA

“An officer called and asked if I wanted to press charges” against her guest, 37-year-old Brooklyn resident Alix — whose last name withheld for privacy reasons— told The Post. “He wanted to know if there was any reason he was trying to steal my cat and go to Florida.”

Authorities were ready to brand the man a catnapper and put him on the No Fly list but Alix reassured them it was a mistake. “Our cats really like to check out bags and boxes and apparently one of them climbed into his suitcase. It was just an accident,” the owner said.

Immediately after getting the call Alix’s fiancé got a car to JFK to rescue the frazzled feline — only to discover the cat was entirely unbothered by the ordeal.

“I was worried he’d be freaked out but he wasn’t even meowing on the way back,” she said. “I went to give him some extra treats and he acted like nothing had happened.”

Cruise’s British commute is allegedly disrupting the filming of the BBC drama “Call the Midwife,” star Jenny Agutter claims in a new interview.

“Tom Cruise keeps on ruining our filming by landing his helicopter right outside where we’re shooting,” the 69-year-old actress told Mirror.

The “Top Gun” star, who holds a pilot license, reportedly flew his helicopter over the “Midwife” set in Surrey, England, causing quite the ruckus while the cast attempted to shoot scenes. Cruise appears to be in town filming “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two.”

A rep for Cruise did not immediately return a Post request for comment. Agutter, who plays Sister Julienne, was asked if she’d give Cruise a talking-to about his allegedly rude chopper habits.

“In my habit! Imagine. ‘Excuse me, Tom, but look, we’re trying to film. I don’t know about you, but just get your helicopter out of here quickly!'” she quipped.

Cruise is no stranger to the skies. In fact, he’s so agile in the air that he’s known for doing his own stunts in the “Top Gun” films.

“I always thought there’s something that I can do and I wanted to push the art form. I thought, ‘How can I immerse an audience into a movie with this kind of action? And how can I entertain them? What can I do?'” the 60-year-old actor said at this year’s Cannes Film Festival, detailing his obsession with risk-taking.

Earth’s vanilla sky doesn’t appear to be enough for Cruise, who is aiming to become the first actor to shoot a movie in outer space — with the goal of filming on the International Space Station.

France's Karim Benzema tore a musle in his thigh in practice Saturday and will miss the tournament. The injury requires at least three weeks of recovery.

""I've never given up in my life, but tonight I have to think of the team, as I have always done,"" Benzema said on Instagram. ""So reason tells me to give my place to someone who can help our squad have a great World Cup. Thanks for all your messages of support.""

FIFA SHRUGS OFF NOTION THAT WORLD CUP ALCOHOL BAN IS AN INCONVENIENCE: 'YOU WILL LIVE'

France is the defending World Cup champion after taking down Croatia 4-2 in the 2018 final in Moscow. Benzema was left off that championship roster because he was the subject of a blackmailing scandal over an alleged recording of a sex video of fellow French player Mathieu Valbuena. Benzema was found guilty last November of conspiring to blackmail.

Benzema was also controversially left off the 2010 squad when he was in the middle of another sex scandal. Because of the blackmailing plot, he was left of the French national team until the 2020 Euros, which were played in the summer of 2021 due to COVID-19. He led the team in the tournament with four goals.

The Portugal international has insisted that he is being forced out the door at Old Trafford, and his criticisms of the club have only accelerated his exit plan.

According to The Mirror, the Red Devils were prepared to allow Ronaldo to leave in the January transfer window but now want the forward off of the books as soon as possible, relieving them of his £500,000-per-week wages. Though a worst-case scenario is potentially brewing, as Chelsea are waiting to reignite their interest in the former Juventus star. Todd Boehly wanted to mark his arrival at Stamford Bridge by signing Ronaldo, though Thomas Tuchel pulled the plug on the move.

But now the German has left, Chelsea remain keen on signing the five-time Ballon d’Or winner. United remain insistent on Ronaldo departing, though they will certainly want the forward to move abroad in hope that they do not rue the decision – but who could he join to please Erik ten Hag’s side?

Her body’s so sick — no believes she’s on track to becoming a doctor.

A fever-inducing med student named Jasmin has social media saying “Ahh” in shock, with her flawless face and hot physique leaving many people stunned that she’s pursuing a medical degree.

“If I got $1 every time they tell me I don’t look like a med student,” Jasmin, from Iran, penned in the closed captions of her viral TikTok about folks questioning her career path.

In the clip, which has garnered more than 176,000 views, the smoking-hot brunette, who’s studying to become an OB/GYN, is seen lip-syncing to Chris Brown and Lil Wayne’s 2014 hit “Loyal.” She empathized the lyrics “Just got rich,” intimating that she’d have a small fortune after collecting single dollars from her doubters.

Beneath both her TikTok and Instagram posts, shady cyber cynics have left cruel comments suggesting that all doctors should looks “old and miserable,” and that she’s too “cute” to fill the role.

But the criticisms haven’t deterred Jasmin, who’s currently in her final year of medical school, from striving after her white coat and stethoscope.

“Guess I am not allowed to take care of myself,” she sarcastically penned as the caption of the post, tacking on the hashtag #Stereotypes for added effect.

Reports that missile had struck in Poland near its border with Ukraine landed as world leaders were gathered in Bali. Many feared the missile had come from Russia and that the attack may trigger a larger NATO response due to Poland's membership status.

Nevertheless, Biden cautioned patience and investigators ultimately found that the missile was not of Russian origin. Instead, the explosion came from a Ukrainian missile designed to shoot down other ordnance. Two Polish citizens were killed in the incident.

We have not reached that pinnacle, believe it or not,"" he continued, blaming President Biden for the current state of the nation. ""In fact, we can go very far. We're going to have to go far first. We have to get out of this ditch. And once we're out, you'll see things that nobody imagined for any country. It's called the United States of America. And it's an incredible place.""

Trump first won the presidency in 2016 against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. If he is elected again, he would become only the second president to retake the White House after having been ousted, a feat achieved by Grover Cleveland in 1892 after he had lost the presidency to Benjamin Harrison in 1888. A victory would make Trump the 45th and the 47th president.

Since his loss, Trump has challenged the legitimacy of the 2020 election results, repeatedly claiming the race was ""rigged,"" due to the COVID pandemic-era process of mail-in ballots. Trump falsely claimed the election was stolen, and his legal team filed a slew of lawsuits in battleground states across the nation.

Trump’s announcement comes one week after the 2022 midterm elections in which Republicans did not obtain an anticipated ""red wave"" of victories. Democrats kept control of the Senate and if Republicans are able to capture a majority in the House, it is expected to be slight. The former president was heavily involved in the midterms, throwing his support behind Republican candidates across the nation. During the primaries, the majority of Trump-endorsed candidates were victorious, becoming the GOP nominee in their races.

The economy, which has been a top issue for voters during the 2022 midterm election cycle amid record-high inflation, was strong under Trump’s presidency—with an increase in middle-class family income, the lowest unemployment rate in half a century and unprecedented job growth.

The stock market hit record highs, with the Dow closing above 20,000 for the first time in 2017 and topping 30,000 in 2020, and the S&P 500 and NASDAQ also hitting record highs.

Trump also worked to cut red tape and reduce regulations facing American businesses and workers, working to put in place policies to bring back supply chains from overseas, in line with his ""Make America Great Again"" and ""America First"" messaging.

As for trade relations, Trump immediately withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and ended the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in January 2017, replacing it with the existing United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which included new protections for American manufacturers and workers.

IF TRUMP ENDORSED GOP NOMINEES LOSE IN NOVEMBER, DOES THE FORMER PRESIDENT TAKE A 2024 HIT?

Trump also signed an executive order making it government policy to ""Buy American and Hire American,"" and took action to stop outsourcing of jobs overseas.

Another issue for Americans during the midterm election cycle has been energy and record-high gas prices.

Under the Trump administration, Trump ensured that the U.S. was the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world, but President Biden reversed some of those policies and refocused on clean energy.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s foreign policy message was one that focused on ""peace through strength.""

Trump withdrew from the Iran Nuclear Deal—which the Biden administration began taking steps to re-enter when he took office in 2021.

Trump held a historic summit with Kim Jong Un in June 2018—he was the first sitting U.S. president to cross the demilitarized zone into North Korea. ICBM testing was paused during the Trump administration, but North Korea did continue to test for short and medium-range ballistic missiles. North Korea has been ramping up its ballistic missile testing under the Biden administration.

TRUMP DROPS NEW HINTS ON POSSIBLE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL RUN: 'WE WERE SO CLOSE'

Regarding the Middle East, the Trump administration brokered the Abraham accords, a ""historic peace agreement"" between Israel and the United Arab Emirates that normalized relations and created bilateral agreements regarding ""investment, tourism, direct flights, security, telecommunications, technology, energy, health care, culture, the environment, the establishment of reciprocal embassies, and other areas of mutual benefit.""

In 2018, the Trump administration moved the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem – a relocation long debated in Washington – and one that showed the U.S. officially recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.

Trump’s administration also rebuilt the military, with more than $2.2 trillion in defense spending, delivering pay raises for service members and their families. Trump's administration also created a new branch of the military— the Space Force.

Trump appointed and had three conservative justices confirmed to the Supreme Court during his presidency — Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.

DONALD TRUMP EDGES OUT PRESIDENT BIDEN IN ELECTION POLL AS BIDEN SLIPS BELOW 40% APPROVAL

Meanwhile, Trump’s administration worked to make communities safer, signing the First Step Act into law--the first landmark criminal justice reform legislation passed to reduce recidivism and help former inmates successfully rejoin society.

A law-and-order president, Trump delivered support for law enforcement and put a major focus on protecting and securing the U.S.-Mexico southern border.

Trump's presidency, from 2017 to 2021, was clouded by investigations—several into whether he colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election, some focused on his finances and others that led to impeachment, making him the first president in United States history to have been impeached twice.

Trump’s post-presidential life has been reminiscent of his days in the Oval Office, marred by probes, which the former president and his allies said were just part of an effort by his political opponents to prevent him from running for re-election in 2024.

The former president is currently under federal investigation by the Justice Department for allegedly mishandling classified documents under the Presidential Records Act. A federal judge appointed Judge Raymond Dearie to serve as special master and review the thousands of records seized by the FBI. Trump and his legal team have argued that none of the documents taken from his Mar-a-Lago home were classified.

TRUMP ‘LOVES THE IDEA OF TESTIFYING’ BEFORE JAN. 6 COMMITTEE: SOURCE CLOSE TO THE FORMER PRESIDENT

The FBI conducted an unprecedented pre-dawn raid of his private residence at Mar-a-Lago in August, alleging that the former president had classified national security information.

The investigation comes amid a criminal investigation into Trump and his family’s business practices by New York Attorney General Letitia James.

Trump raised $10.2 million in August after the FBI’s unprecedented raid—the most Save America PAC had raised in a month since Trump was in office. As of mid-October, Trump’s Save America PAC had just under $100 million cash-on-hand.

Also this summer, a federal appeals court paved the way for the House Ways and Means Committee to finally obtain Trump’s tax returns from the Internal Revenue Service—something the panel has been trying to obtain since 2019, under a law that permits the disclosure of an individual's tax returns to the congressional committee.

Trump may seek emergency intervention measures from the Supreme Court in an attempt to temporarily block any release of these tax records—which likely will come under renewed scrutiny now that he decided to run for a third time.

When Trump first took office in January 2017, the FBI was in the middle of conducting a counterintelligence investigation into whether candidate Donald Trump and members of his campaign were colluding or coordinating with Russia to influence the 2016 election. That investigation was referred to inside the bureau as ""Crossfire Hurricane,"" and began on July 31, 2016.

That investigation was opened, despite then-CIA Director John Brennan briefing then-President Obama on July 28, 2016 about a purported proposal from one of Hillary Clinton's campaign foreign policy advisers ""to vilify Donald Trump by stirring up a scandal claiming interference by the Russian security service.""

Special Counsel Robert Mueller ultimately was appointed to take over the investigation, but, after nearly two years, Mueller’s investigation, which concluded in March 2019, yielded no evidence of criminal conspiracy or coordination between the Trump campaign and Russian officials during the 2016 presidential election.

Special Counsel John Durham is currently investigating the origins of the FBI's Trump-Russia probe.

Weeks after Mueller’s probe was complete, Trump had a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during which he pressed Zelenskyy to launch investigations into the Biden family’s actions and business dealings in Ukraine—specifically Hunter Biden’s ventures with Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings. Hunter Biden, at the time, was, and still is, under federal criminal investigation for his tax affairs, prompted by suspicious foreign transactions.

The president’s request came after millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen, which Democrats and some witnesses have cited as a quid pro quo arrangement. Democrats also claimed Trump was meddling in the next presidential election by asking a foreign leader to look into a Democratic political opponent.

Trump’s conversation with Zelenskyy prompted a whistleblower complaint, which led to the House impeachment inquiry, and ultimately, impeachment proceedings in the Senate.

The House voted to impeach Trump in December 2019 on two counts— abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The Senate voted for acquittal in February 2020.

Meanwhile, on Jan. 6, 2021, pro-Trump rioters breached the U.S. Capitol during a joint session of Congress to certify the Electoral College results in favor of President Biden. Trump was permanently banned from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube after the riot.

The House of Representatives then drafted articles of impeachment against him again, and ultimately voted to impeach him on a charge of inciting an insurrection for the Jan. 6 Capitol riot—making him the first and only president to be impeached, and ultimately acquitted, twice in history.

Trump's legal team denounced the proceedings as an unconstitutional ""sham impeachment"" against a private citizen, driven by Democrats' ""hatred"" for Trump and desire to silence a political opponent.

The Senate voted to acquit, but had Trump been convicted, the Senate would have moved to bar the 45th president from holding federal office ever again, preventing a 2024 White House run.

2e57afbf-dfd2-4663-8014-e0b639fc7230,"PALM BEACH, Fla. — Former President Donald Trump ended months of speculation and launched his bid to retake the White House in 2024 Tuesday, an early attempt to clear the GOP primary field ahead of a potential rematch against Joe Biden.

“Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests and my fellow citizens, America’s comeback starts right now,” Trump, 76, told hundreds of cheering supporters who gathered in the ornate ballroom of his Mar-a-Lago resort for the official announcement.

“In order to make America great and glorious again, I am tonight announcing my candidacy for president of the United States.”

Moments before his remarks, the 45th president filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission confirming his candidacy.

“I will ensure that Joe Biden does not receive four more years,” he added later in his remarks. “Our country could not take that. And I say that not in laughter, I say that in tears. Our country could not take four more years. They can only take so much.”

Since Trump left office, polls have indicated his standing among Republicans has declined, with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis seen as another top contender for the nomination.

The former president made a theatrical entrance after the sound system blasted the anthem “Do You Hear the People Sing?” from the musical “Les Miserables.”

“Our enemies are speaking of us with scorn and laughter and derision … People are going absolutely wild and crazy. They are not happy. They are very, very angry,” Trump said.

“Now we have a president who falls asleep at global conferences, was held in contempt by the British Parliament over Afghanistan … and he is leading us to the brink of nuclear war, a concept unimaginable just two short years ago.”

Trump vowed that if he’s elected to a second non-consecutive term, “we will be a great nation again.”

“The decline of America is being forced upon us by Biden and the radical-left lunatics running our government right into the ground. This decline is not a fate we must accept,” he said.

Trump brushed off the unexpectedly poor showing by Republicans in last week’s midterm elections, in which Democrats retained the Senate and Republicans were on track to gain the House by a hair. “Nancy Pelosi has been fired,” Trump said. “I said, ‘If you win by two seats, be happy.'”

In a swipe at his would-be competitors, Trump said that the job of “taking on the most corrupt forces and entrenched interests imaginable” was “not a task for a politician or a conventional candidate. This is a task for a great movement.”

The former president also lauded his own policies during his four years in office and said he was running on a “national greatness agenda” — while slamming Biden for his actions as well as his frequent gaffes.

Biden says he also plans to run again in 2024, despite turning 80 on Nov. 20.

Trump offered a comprehensive policy platform in his 65-minute speech, though some members of his roughly 1,000-strong audience began speaking among themselves and ignoring his words toward the end.

“Unlike Biden possibly getting us into World War III, which can seriously happen, I will keep America out of foolish and unnecessary foreign wars, just as I did for four straight years,” Trump said.

“The world was at peace,” Trump went on, reflecting on when he left office in 2021. “America was prospering, and our country was on track for an amazing future. Because I made big promises to the American people and unlike other presidents, I kept my promises.”

On domestic policy, Trump won cheers by pledging that “we will not let men participate in women’s sports” in reference to transgender athletes and said he would call for Congress to approve the death penalty for drug dealers.

Previous 1 of 3 Next A Trump supporter attends the ex-president's announcement Tuesday evening at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida. The former commander-in-chief said his administration would bring glory back to America. Trump's youngest child, Barron, and son-in-law Jared Kushner arrive for the announcement.

“We’re going to be asking everyone who sells drugs, gets caught selling drugs, to receive the death penalty for their heinous acts,” Trump said, despite his record of releasing from prison many drug dealers — including springing on his final day in office seven men jailed for life for marijuana dealing, two of whom were given that penalty as a consequence of Sen. Joe Biden’s 1994 crime law.

Trump also vowed to double down on protectionism and ensure “low taxes, low regulations and fair trade.”

He also asserted that he would bring down inflation — currently at its highest sustained rate since the early 1980s — to around 1%, versus 7.7% currently, and said he would work to return supply chains and manufacturing from China.

“Economic security is national security,” Trump said. “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it. And if you do, you’re going to pay three or four times more.”

The ex-president said he also would “insist” that local officials accept federal intervention to quell rising violent crime because “people are being shot and killed at random like you’ve never seen before” and cities are becoming “cesspools of blood.”

Trump also said he would finish his long-promised US-Mexico border wall and work to deport “illegal immigrant criminals” — and take aim at “festering rot” in Washington by pushing a constitutional amendment imposing congressional term limits, along with a lifetime ban on lobbying by former lawmakers and cabinet members and new rules restricting congressional stock trades.

Guests at the event included staffers who will work on Trump’s campaign, among themSusie Wiles, a former DeSantis aide, senior adviser Chris LaCivita, senior communications adviser Steven Cheung, longtime Trump associate Boris Epshteyn and Trump spokesman Taylor Budowich.

Former Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller, the current CEO of fledgling social media network GETTR, also mingled with reporters, as did longtime Trump associate Roger Stone.

Trump’s sons Eric and Barron and son-in-law Jared Kushner attended — while Donald Trump Jr., who was on a hunting trip, was unable to make the event due to a flight issue. Kushner’s wife, Ivanka Trump, a former unpaid West Wing adviser, was not in attendance and later issued a statement saying she wanted no part of her father’s latest campaign.

“This time around, I am choosing to prioritize my young children and the private life we are creating as a family,” the elder Trump daughter said in a statement. “I do not plan to be involved in politics. While I will always love and support my father, going forward I will do so outside the political arena.”

At least one member of Congress, outgoing Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-NC), was present — after one of the few lawmakers expected, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), gave the event a miss due to a scheduling conflict with House GOP leadership votes.

A tranche of Trump administration alums also attended, among them former White House budget director Russ Vought, former acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker and former White House advisers Seb Gorka and Stephen Miller.

If Trump wins in 2024, Vought told The Post, “from day one he will know how to put his hand in the glove and wield as much power within the federal government as possible and I think he will have a staff and an administration of like-minded individuals.”

“I think it’s going to be a scrappy campaign that has a lot of the feel of the 2016 campaign,” Vought added. “He has got fire in the belly. He’s got unfinished business.”

Whitaker told The Post that “there’s no reason to expect that he will be unopposed [for the Republican nomination], but at the same time I’m really excited … this is going to be one of those seasons to not miss.”

Previous 1 of 2 Next Longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone was in attendance. Trump admin senior advisor Stephen Miller speaks with supporters before the announcement.

“I think the early Trump years were marked by maybe some staff that wasn’t up to the challenge and he kept trying to find the right people and put them in the right spots,” Whitaker said. “I think he finally hit his stride as he headed from ’19 to ’20. I think he’s going to have some great people identified and I think he’s going to be in a position from day one to drive the thing forward.”

The event occurred as Trump takes blame for his intervention in this month’s midterm elections — with critics saying his primary-campaign endorsements of candidates like Dr. Mehmet Oz in the Pennsylvania Senate contest cost the GOP winnable races.

“Much criticism is being placed on the fact that the Republican Party should have done better and frankly, much of this blame is correct,” Trump said Tuesday night, before adding: “I do want to point out that in the midterms, my endorsement success rate was 232 wins and only 22 losses. You don’t hear that from the media.”

However, the former president did not note that many of his victories were for endorsements of candidates in safe House seats, where his support was not necessary to ensure Republican wins.

Trump entered the race as Republicans warm to DeSantis after the Florida governor won re-election last week by a nearly 20 percentage-point margin.

The former president betrayed his own view of DeSantis at a Nov. 5 rally in Pennsylvania, where Trump dismissed his home-state governor as “Ron DeSanctimonious” and later took a swipe at another potential rival, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, by saying his name sounded “Chinese.”

After Trump’s chosen candidates disappointed in last week’s midterms, he lashed out at DeSantis in a post on Truth Social Nov. 10, dismissing his would-be rival as an “average REPUBLICAN Governor with great Public Relations” before demanding he rule himself out of a 2024 run.

Trump, who did not mention DeSantis in his remarks, may have reason to view the Florida governor as a threat.

A series of snap post-midterm polls conducted on behalf of conservative nonprofit Club For Growth found DeSantis held double-digit leads over Trump among likely GOP primary voters in Florida, neighboring Georgia and the early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire.

However, Trump and his fervent supporters are still a force to be reckoned with in Republican politics.

A Politico/Morning Consult poll released Tuesday showed 47% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents would support the former president in a hypothetical primary, while just 33% would back DeSantis.

Although Trump lost to Biden by more than 7 million votes nationally in 2020, the race was much tighter in the swing states that determined the Electoral College victor. If Trump had gained about 43,000 votes, the Electoral College would have been tied and the House of Representatives would have decided the outcome, with Republicans holding enough state delegations to re-elect Trump.

Still, Trump is kicking off his third straight presidential campaign amid the backdrop of a potential indictment by the Justice Department on charges of mishandling classified information after the FBI raided his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Aug. 8 and removed dozens of sensitive documents.

Trump is also being investigated in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, during which a wild mob of his supporters disrupted certification of Biden’s victory.

Meanwhile, a Georgia grand jury is holding hearings about whether the former president and his allies acted illegally in attempting to overturn Trump’s 2020 election loss to Biden in the Peach State. Former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Trump’s onetime personal lawyer, is among almost 20 people named as targets of that investigation.

Therefore, if Trump wins the White House again in 2024, he will have pulled off one of the biggest political comebacks in US history after leaving office with the riot overshadowing his domestic and foreign policy accomplishments.

Trump was impeached just days before he left office for allegedly inciting the Capitol riot, notably with a speech to thousands of people on the Ellipse near the White House. The 45th president encouraged his audience to march on Congress because the election was being “stolen” — despite the fact that courts had rejected his claims of widespread fraud.

The mob proceeded to battle police and break into the Capitol building. The Senate acquitted Trump by a vote of 57-43, 10 votes short of the two-thirds required for conviction, meaning he remains eligible to hold office.

Trump was initially impeached in 2019 for pressuring Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden’s reported $1 million-per-year job at Ukrainian gas firm Burisma while his vice president father led the Obama administration’s Ukraine policy.

The former president is expected to run on various well-worn boasts while slamming Biden’s management of the nation since taking office.

In 2017, Trump signed a major tax cut into law and in 2018 pushed through a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill that reduced harsh federal sentences, including penalties authored by then-Sen. Biden in the 1990s that jailed some drug dealers for life without parole. He nominated three conservative Supreme Court justices, allowing for the court to end federal abortion rights last month.

On foreign policy, Trump’s administration brokered recognition of Israel by four Arab states and he defused tensions with nuclear-armed North Korean tyrant Kim Jong Un with three meetings. He forced a rewrite of the NAFTA trade deal with Canada and Mexico and rechristened the pact USMCA while waging a tariffs-driven trade war with China in a bid to force another major agreement.

The COVID-19 pandemic and associated local government-ordered business closures caused an economic bust that wiped away Trump’s ability to claim record national prosperity.

Trump urged a reopening of US society in mid-2020 while pouring billions into vaccine development, but restrictions dragged on and a breakthrough was announced too late to benefit his campaign.

Pfizer announced six days after Election Day that its vaccine was more than 90% effective against COVID-19 infection — heralding a return toward normalcy.

Biden, who turns 80 this year, insists that he will seek re-election, but there are widespread doubts, including among fellow Democrats. He’s already the oldest-ever US president and would be 86 if he leaves office in 2029.

The president’s average job approval rating sits at 42%, according to RealClearPolitics — and even lower among core Democratic-leaning groups such as young people and Hispanics — as record gas prices, the worst inflation since 1981 and rising violent crime and illegal immigration drag on his popularity.

“We do not have to endure what is taking place in Washington,” Trump said. “You see our country, the corridors of power … they’re our corridors, they’re not their corridors.”

“These are our corridors, and we are going to take those corridors back.”

Trump would be the second president elected to non-consecutive terms, after Democrat Grover Cleveland in 1884 and 1892. He would have to leave office in January 2029 because the Constitution doesn’t allow a president to be elected to three terms."

Estimated read time: 5-6 minutes

KYIV, Ukraine — Russia pounded Ukraine's energy facilities Tuesday with its biggest barrage of missiles yet, striking targets across the country and causing widespread blackouts, and a U.S. official said missiles crossed into NATO member Poland, where two people were killed.

A defiant Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy shook his fist and declared: ""We will survive everything.""

Polish government spokesman Piotr Mueller did not immediately confirm the information from a senior U.S. intelligence official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the situation. But Mueller said top leaders were holding an emergency meeting due to a ""crisis situation.""

Polish media reported that two people died Tuesday afternoon after a projectile struck an area where grain was drying in Przewodów, a Polish village near the border with Ukraine.

Neighboring Moldova was also affected. It reported massive power outages after the strikes knocked out a key power line that supplies the small nation, an official said.

Zelenskyy said Russia fired at least 85 missiles, ""most of them at our energy infrastructure,"" and shut down power in many cities.

""We're working, will restore everything. We will survive everything,"" the president vowed. His energy minister said the attack was ""the most massive"" bombardment of power facilities in the nearly 9-month-old Russian invasion, striking both power generation and transmission systems.

The minister, Herman Haluschenko, described the missile strikes as ""another attempt at terrorist revenge"" after military and diplomatic setbacks for the Kremlin. He accused Russia of ""trying to cause maximum damage to our energy system on the eve of winter.""

The aerial assault, which resulted in at least one death in a residential building in the capital, Kyiv, followed days of euphoria in Ukraine sparked by one of its biggest military successes — the retaking last week of the southern city of Kherson.

The power grid was already battered by previous attacks that destroyed an estimated 40% of the country's energy infrastructure.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has not commented on the retreat from Kherson since his troops pulled out in the face of a Ukrainian offensive. But the stunning scale of Tuesday's strikes spoke volumes and hinted at anger in the Kremlin.

Further south, officials announced probes of alleged Russian abuses in the newly retaken city of Kherson, including torture sites and enforced disappearances and detentions. (Photo: Andrew Kravchenko, Associated Press)

By striking targets in the late afternoon, not long before dusk began to fall, the Russian military forced rescue workers to labor in the dark and gave repair crews scant time to assess the damage by daylight.

More than a dozen regions — among them Lviv in the west, Kharkiv in the northeast and others in between — reported strikes or efforts by their air defenses to shoot missiles down. At least a dozen regions reported power outages, affecting cities that together have millions of people. Almost half of the Kyiv region lost power, authorities said. Ukrainian Railways announced nationwide train delays.

Zelenskyy warned that more strikes were possible and urged people to stay safe and seek shelter.

""Most of the hits were recorded in the center and in the north of the country. In the capital, the situation is very difficult,"" said a senior official, Kyrylo Tymoshenko.

He said a total of 15 energy targets were damaged and claimed that 70 missiles were shot down. A Ukrainian Air Force spokesman said Russia used X-101 and X-555 cruise missiles.

As city after city reported attacks, Tymoshenko urged Ukrainians to ""hang in there.""

With its battlefield losses mounting, Russia has increasingly resorted to targeting Ukraine's power grid, seemingly hoping to turn the approach of winter into a weapon by leaving people in the cold and dark.

People charge their phones, try to connect to the internet and make phone calls, in central square in Kherson, Ukraine, Tuesday. Waves of Russian airstrikes rocked Ukraine on Tuesday, with authorities immediately announcing emergency blackouts after attacks from east to west on energy and other facilities knocked out power and, in the capital, struck residential buildings. (Photo: Efrem Lukatsky, Associated Press)

In Kyiv, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said authorities found a body in one of three residential buildings that were struck in the capital, where emergency blackouts were also announced by power provider DTEK.

Video published by a presidential aide showed a five-story, apparently residential building in Kyiv on fire, with flames licking through apartments. Klitschko said air defense units also shot down some missiles.

Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra took to a bomb shelter in Kyiv after meeting his Ukrainian counterpart and, from his place of safety, described the bombardment as ""an enormous motivation to keep standing shoulder-to-shoulder"" with Ukraine.

""There can be only one answer, and that is: Keep going. Keep supporting Ukraine, keep delivering weapons, keep working on accountability, keep working on humanitarian aid,"" he said.

Ukraine had seen a period of comparative calm since previous waves of drone and missile attacks several weeks ago.

The strikes came as authorities were already working furiously to get Kherson back on its feet and beginning to investigate alleged Russian abuses there and in the surrounding area.

The southern city is without power and water, and the head of the U.N. human rights office's monitoring mission in Ukraine, Matilda Bogner, on Tuesday decried a ""dire humanitarian situation"" there.

Speaking from Kyiv, Bogner said her teams are looking to travel to Kherson to try to verify allegations of nearly 80 cases of forced disappearances and arbitrary detention.

The head of the National Police of Ukraine, Igor Klymenko, said authorities are to start investigating reports from Kherson residents that Russian forces set up at least three alleged torture sites in now-liberated parts of the wider Kherson region and that ""our people may have been detained and tortured there.""

The retaking of Kherson dealt another stinging blow to the Kremlin. Zelenskyy likened the recapture to the Allied landings in France on D-Day in World War II, saying both were watershed events on the road to eventual victory.

But large parts of eastern and southern Ukraine remain under Russian control, and fighting continues.

Zelenskyy warned of possible more grim news ahead.

""Everywhere, when we liberate our land, we see one thing — Russia leaves behind torture chambers and mass burials. … How many mass graves are there in the territory that still remains under the control of Russia?"" Zelenskyy asked.

Cowra is around 189 miles inland from Sydney and has a population of less than 10,000 people.

It has been reported a rottweiler and cattle dog were the breeds responsible for the horrific attack. Both animals were believed to be owned by staff at the Country Gardens Motor Inn and they have now been taken away by authorities.

Kesha Pollard, the boy’s mum, reportedly said that she and her children were staying at the hotel while waiting for permanent accommodation.

A relative has also said that the kids had been playing with the dogs previously and there had not been a problem.

The person told the Sydney’s Daily Telegraph that the attack happened for “no known reason”.

They said: “He’s the most precious and beautiful kid, no one can believe it’s happened to him.”

Jyedon suffered neck and facial injuries and was taken to Cowra Hospital before being airlifted to Westmead Hospital in Sydney were he tragically died from the injuries on Tuesday afternoon.

There have been conflicting reports over whether Jyedon's mother and two sisters saw the attack.

Chifley police superintendent Bob Noble said that there were no witnesses as the dog attack took place in a backyard, reported 9news.com.au.

47e6f391-e7f6-498f-bcc8-04b279ebbf5c,"South Korea has scrambled dozens of military aircraft, including advanced F35 fighter jets, after spotting 180 North Korean warplanes flying in North Korean territory in what appeared to be a defiant show of strength.

North Korea’s aerial exercises on Friday came after the North test-fired around 30 ballistic missiles during the two previous days, including an intercontinental ballistic missile on Thursday that triggered evacuation warnings in Japan, in an angry response to U.S.-South Korea joint air force drills involving hundreds of their warplanes.

South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the North Korean warplanes were detected in various areas inland and along the country’s eastern and western coasts, but they did not come particularly close to the inter-Korean border.

None of those planes breached the South Korean military’s virtual “tactical action” line, which is designated 20 to 50 kilometers (12 to 31 miles) north of the Koreas’ land and sea boundaries for monitoring purposes to give the South enough time to respond to provocations or attacks.

The South still scrambled 80 of its own warplanes, including an unspecified number of F35 fighters, but there weren’t any immediate reports of clashes.

U.S. and South Korean forces were also separately conducting their “Vigilant Storm” combined aerial exercise, which involved some 240 warplanes, including F35s. The training had been scheduled through Friday, but the allies extended it to Saturday in response to North Korea’s intensified testing activity this week.

The extension of the drills was announced on Thursday after the North test-fired an ICBM, which triggered evacuation alerts in northern Japan, and followed the event with two short-range ballistic missile launches into sea.

A senior North Korean military official issued a statement threatening retaliation over the extension of the drills, and the North about an hour later fired three additional missiles into the sea.

On Wednesday, North Korea fired more than 20 missiles, the most it has launched in a single day.

After already setting an annual record with dozens of ballistic missile launches in 2022, North Korea has further dialed up its testing activity since late September, including what it described as simulated nuclear attacks on South Korean and U.S. targets. It has said its tests are meant as a warning against the United States’ military drills with allies South Korea and Japan which it portrays as rehearsals for a potential invasion.

Experts say North Korea is escalating brinkmanship aimed at forcing the United States to accept it as a nuclear power and at negotiating economic and security concessions from a position of strength."
a17f4f33-68ab-4eca-ac78-e898689ced0d,"SEOUL (Reuters)—South Korea‘s military said it scrambled fighter jets after detecting about 180 North Korean military flights north of the two countries' border over four hours on Friday.

The North Korean aircraft flew north of the so-called tactical action line, north of the Military Demarcation Line between the two Koreas, South Korea‘s military said in a statement. The virtual line is used as a basis for South Korean air defence operations, a South Korean official said.

South Korea scrambled 80 aircraft, including, F-35A stealth fighters, in response. About 240 aircraft participating in the Vigilant Storm exercises with the United States continued the drills, the military said.

A flight of 10 North Korean warplanes made similar manoeuvres last month, prompting South Korea to scramble jets.

The manoeuvres came after North Korea fired more than 80 rounds of artillery into the sea overnight, and the launch of multiple missiles into the sea on Thursday, including a possible failed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).

The launches prompted the United States and South Korea to extend air drills that have angered Pyongyang.

Estimated read time: 8-9 minutes

SALT LAKE CITY — Gabby Petito's family is seeking $50 million in a lawsuit filed Thursday, claiming negligence by the Moab Police Department led to Petito's death.

James W. McConkie, one of the attorneys for the Petito family with Salt Lake City-based Parker and McConkie, said the purpose of the lawsuit is to demand accountability, create change in the system to prevent tragedies and honor Petito's legacy. The lawsuit claims that if Moab police officers had followed Utah law, Petito would still be alive.

""The epidemic of domestic violence is a silent killer, the sign and symptoms of which often go unrecognized by those not familiar with interpersonal violence. ... To combat domestic violence, each of us has to do our part to call out abusers and know how to identify systemic problems that enable abuse, even when that is difficult to do,"" he said.

McConkie noted that Gabby has four parents who raised her since she was a child, although only her biological parents are represented in the lawsuit because of Utah law, Joseph Petito and Nichole Schmidt. Petito's parents and their spouses, Tara Petito and Jim Schmidt, came to Utah for a press conference announcing the lawsuit, and to speak about their loss and the need for change.

Joe Petito said although tragedy has happened in the past, those tragedies didn't lead to changes in the system.

""Unfortunately this (lawsuit) was ... the best way to have those changes made. It's just that simple,"" he said.

He encouraged anyone in a domestic violence situation to reach out for help, and for others to help people know where to turn.

Gabby Petito, a 22-year-old self-proclaimed travel influencer, who was traveling with her fiancé, was reported missing on Sept. 11, 2021. Her disappearance gripped the nation.

Her body was found on Sept. 19 at the Spread Creek Dispersed Camping Area in Wyoming's Bridger-Teton National Forest almost four weeks after her family last heard from her. The Teton County Coroner's Office ruled Petito died from blunt force trauma and strangulation.

Her fiancé, Brian Laundrie, with whom she had been traveling the country, went missing following the discovery. In a notebook later found near his body at a nature preserve in Sarasota County, Florida, Laundrie admitted to killing Gabby Petito. An autopsy showed Laundrie died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Nichole Schmidt said she was broken by the loss of her daughter, and they miss her. But they consider their loss an opportunity to help other families.

""We feel we need to bring justice, because she could have been protected that day. There are laws put in place to protect victims and those laws were not followed. And we don't want this to happen to anybody else,"" she said.

She said her daughter is a light, and is continuing to inspire others through them and the foundation established after her daughter's death. Jim Schmidt said their daughter's story resonated with people around the world, and through a partnership with the Domestic Violence Hotline, their website has helped hundreds of people find access to resources and support.

The family's claims

Since Gabby Petito's encounter with Moab police in August 2021, the lawsuit claims that one of the responding officers, Eric Pratt, is a ""domestic abuser"" who has ""used authority and threats of physical violence to control and intimidate sexual partners."" The suit says he was ""fundamentally biased in his approach to the investigation, identifying with Gabby's abuser, ignoring the victim and intentionally looking for loopholes to get around the requirements of Utah law and his duty to protect Gabby.""

Brian Stewart, another Petito family attorney, said Moab police either knew or should have known about Pratt's history of sexual harassment, and claims Pratt was ""manifestly unfit and unsafe to be a police officer.""

At the scene of the incident with Gabby Petito and Laundrie in Moab, Pratt said, ""I don't care if we use the actual letter of the law,"" after explaining why the domestic assault code protects people, showing he understood its purpose and the risks, according to Stewart.

""Gabby would be alive today if the officers had done their job to protect her and followed the law,"" Stewart said.

Stewart said Gabby Petito's story has already saved multiple lives by giving others courage to report abuse.

""Their resilience and determination to use their tragedy to effect positive change and save lives has been an inspiration to millions,"" he said.

He said the family did not take the decision to file a lawsuit lightly, and they do not want to blame police for their loss — but they relied on the officers to protect their daughter. Stewart said once it was clear the officers did not follow the law, the family knew they had an obligation to Gabby Petito to ""demand accountability and change.""

Moab police response

Moab city officials publicly recognized Gabby Petito's death as a tragedy and were sympathetic toward the family, but said police officers were not responsible for the murder. City officials said they ""will ardently defend"" against the lawsuit, and that Moab police officers acted ""with kindness, respect and empathy toward Ms. Petito.""

""The attorneys for the Petito family seem to suggest that, somehow, our officers could see into the future, based on this single interaction. In truth, on Aug. 12, no one could have predicted the tragedy that would occur weeks later and hundreds of miles away,"" Moab police said in a statement Wednesday.

The city said Gabby Petito died over two weeks after the Moab police interaction with her and Laundrie, and in a separate state.

In response to this, Stewart said the Utah Legislature and Pratt both understood that domestic violence situations can lead to death, as shown by a law that was passed that doesn't allow officers discretion in similar circumstances — and Pratt explained the purpose of that restriction.

McConkie said the Utah lawsuit is part of a bigger effort by Gabby Petito's parents to raise awareness of intimate partner violence across the country. The family wants to help victims of domestic violence to know there are resources available and that law enforcement is reliable.

""They hope their efforts to help will save lives and give meaning to the senseless, avoidable and tragic murder of their daughter,"" McConkie said.

What is in the lawsuit?

The lawsuit, which was filed in Utah's 7th District Court in Grand County on Thursday, said the Moab Police Department and individuals within the department negligently hired and failed to train officers and that the negligence of individual officers ""caused Gabby's tragic and untimely death.""

It relates an interaction between Gabby Petito and Laundrie and the Moab police on Aug. 12, 2021, which was recorded on police body cameras.

Gabby Petito's family explains that the Utah Legislature removes discretion of officers in domestic violence situations — requiring a protective order separating the abuser and victim.

""The officers — based on their tragic failure to identify Brian as the abuser — coached Gabby to provide answers that the officers used to justify their decision not to enforce Utah law,"" the lawsuit states.

The lawsuit, attorneys said, is ""a vehicle for systemic change, and a reckoning about how the police enforce (Utah's) domestic abuse laws."" The specific changes requested in the suit include that:

Officers should not assert immunity for actions that result in a wrongful death.

Officers should be trained in and use effective methods when evaluating domestic abuse situations so victims can be protected.

Police departments should stop hiring and retaining officers with professional misconduct or personal biases that make them unfit to serve.

""Gabby did not have to die. ... Gabby would still be alive if officer Pratt had not intentionally coached Gabby and manipulated the investigation to try to find loopholes that would allow him to disregard the mandates of Utah law and his duty to protect Gabby. Defendants' negligence deprived Gabby of her safety and ultimately her life,"" the lawsuit says.

McConkie said signs of domestic violence don't often seem threatening to others, but they should be recognized by police officers who are trained to intervene.

""Domestic violence is a poison, a silent killer, that could very well affect our own lives and our own loved ones,"" he said.

The Petito family also retained a firm that specializes in appellate law, Zimmerman Booher. Dick J. Baldwin from that firm said although a lawsuit cannot solve the Petito family's loss, it can bring some form of justice.

He said the lawsuit seeks damages based on negligence by the officers and failure by the police department to properly train and screen its officers.

Baldwin said although police officers have some government immunity, a unique aspect of the Utah Constitution is that the right for a wrongful death lawsuit is protected, and they believe the claim is even protected against officers who have immunity.

The lawsuit asks for $50 million in damages, Stewart said, although the actual amount will be determined by a jury or out of court in an agreement between the family and the Moab Police Department.

""We added that number as a symbol of the severity of this problem in our country and how important that it is and how grave the loss is that this family has suffered ... the intent of that number is to show the severity of the problem and the gravity of their loss,"" Stewart said.

He said no amount of money can make up for the Petito family's loss, but the family's intent is to use any funds they do receive as a result of the lawsuit to support the efforts of the Gabby Petito Foundation to help victims of domestic violence. Each of Petito's parents nodded in agreement when Stewart said they will be engaged in the efforts for the rest of their lives.

A woman says she was inundated with unsolicited messages from men after she posted a photo of herself in a clothing item she was trying to sell on Facebook Marketplace.

April, who is a DJ, posted a photo of herself wearing an orange two-piece beachwear set on the site.

She was cradling her stomach in the image, later revealing she was pregnant when the photo was taken.

But instead of getting potential buyers interested in the outfit, April got potential buyers interested from another quarter entirely.

A pregnant woman, who is also a DJ, posted a photo of herself in an orange two-piece beachwear she was selling on Facebook Marketplace. @djaprilia/TikTok

She shared to TikTok some of the multiple messages she received from men over the listing, which clocked up more than 15,000 views.

In her TikTok clip, she wrote over the photo: “POV: You innocently upload this pic to Marketplace to sell the outfit.”

The clip used Kim Petras and Sam Smith’s song Unholy.

One reply she got to the ad said: “Dress to impress.”

Another was simply a greeting with several heart emojis.

Previous 1 of 3 Next The post received over 15,000 clicks. Instead of getting messages about the beachwear, the DJ received unsolicited messages from men who looked at the post. A picture of one message that a man sent in response to the Facebook Marketplace posting.

However, the messages steadily became more vulgar with one man asking, “Do you come with the dress?” as well as other lewd messages.

“These men are just too much. I am literally pregnant here,” April captioned the clip.

Many women sided with April, slamming the reaction she got.

“Everything is taken sexually these days but this dress is also [a] perfect maternity dress,” one said.

Another added: “OMG this happened to me! I posted my Depop clothes on Marketplace and it was insane.”

Several other women shared similar experiences but there were some who suggested April was “asking for” the attention.

In response, the new mom said: “To y’all getting nasty: I am 100 percent certain that when you online shop, you look at models wearing the clothes to show you what the outfit looks like.

0430b034-5212-4f38-8634-307a085bdbc1,"Here's a very important piece from Mere Orthodoxy by Simon Kennedy, writing about a terrible sign for non-conforming Christians in Australia. It's about the forced resignation of Andrew Thorburn (pictured above) from his new position as head of an Australian football team. Kennedy said this vindicates the analysis of US Evangelical thinkers Aaron Renn and James Wood, who say Bible-believing Christians (as opposed to those who have made their peace with wokeness) are now living in ""Negative World"" -- that is, in a cultural milieu in which it is damaging to be a traditional Christian. Excerpts:

In case anyone was unconvinced about either Wood’s or Renn’s analysis, one of Australia’s biggest football clubs, the Melbourne-based Essendon Bombers, has served up a lesson in Negative World cultural dynamics. One day, they were announcing the appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer, Andrew Thorburn. The appointment was a high-profile one, with Thorburn having led one of Australia’s biggest banks for many years. He was an accomplished and credible appointment. The very next day, Thorburn resigned. Why? He was found guilty of involvement in a church whose minister preached a sermon in 2013 arguing that abortion is evil and, in a further sermon, homosexuality is a sin. The Essendon board were made aware of these unsavory utterances, and one thing rapidly led to another. The Essendon Board Chairman said that once they found out about this apparently sordid connection between Thorburn and a bible-believing church, they “acted.” The train of events, as it was made public, suggests that Thorburn was asked to choose between his new job or his church affiliation. Thorburn chose his church and resigned. This was a watershed cultural moment for Australia, and possibly for the West. A man with outstanding credentials was told that, because of some sermons preached by someone else from almost a decade ago, he needed to reconsider his fit for the role he had just been appointed to. For all we know, Thorburn may disagree with these sermons. He may never have been aware of them or listened to them. The bottom line here was guilt-by-association. In Australia, things have reached a point where someone can be pressured to leave their job because of their association with a group that is out of step with the moral orthodoxy of the day. Conservative Christians are evidently no longer welcome in positions of public prominence.

Kennedy reports that Thorburn attends a hipster urban church whose teachings are what we would call ""conservative"" on abortion and homosexuality, but which presents itself as easygoing and seeker-friendly. Guy Mason, the pastor, went on national TV to talk about the controversy, and was mauled by his hostile interviewer. Watch the five minute interview below. True, the interviewer was aggressive, but Mason was a winsome marshmallow who thought he could deal with these harsh questions by leaning hard into ""love"" and ""diversity."" Watch it here for an object lesson in the reality of Negative World. Seriously, take the time to watch it. This is where winsomeness goes to die:

""The intention was not to be inflammatory, the words were wrong"" Pastor Guy Mason from City on a Hill church has defended Andrew Thorburn after he resigned from his new role as CEO of Essendon football club over the church's stance on homosexuality and abortion.#Sunriseon7 pic.twitter.com/wyGjeaY8VA — Sunrise (@sunriseon7) October 5, 2022

Kennedy concludes:

Thorburn’s resignation and Mason’s interview demonstrate that the church needs to face this hard truth: the world has shifted and therefore the age of conciliatory cultural engagement is over. No longer will being nice and relevant cut it. No amount of “life and love” will change the fact that, in Australia at least, we’ve entered Negative World proper.

Read it all. It's important. To learn more about Renn's ""Three Worlds Of Evangelicalism"" framework, read this.

See, this is why I wrote The Benedict Option and Live Not By Lies: to prepare Christians for this kind of thing. The woke elites in Australia drove this man out of his job in a single day, because he attends a church where a decade ago, the pastor criticized homosexuality and abortion. That's all it took. To his very great credit, Andrew Thorburn chose to stand by his faith, and resign his position. Are you prepared to do the same? Will your children be? Will you have a strong community standing by you to pick you up after the culture throws you out of the window onto the street? Can you say where the line is, beyond which you cannot be pushed, for the sake of the Gospel?

If not, you're going to get flattened at best, and will apostatize at worst. If you're not preparing yourself, your family, and your community for this test now, you're going to fail it badly when they come for you. And they will come for you."

The late-night show host, 54, went ham on the new Twitter owner, 51, on the social media platform after the businessman posted a conspiracy theory about the recent attack on Nancy Pelosi’s husband, Paul.

Assailant David DePape is said to have assaulted Paul, 82, with a hammer after breaking into the home he shares with the speaker of the US House of Representatives.

Soon after the incident, Hillary Clinton tweeted: “The Republican Party and its mouthpieces now regularly spread hate and deranged conspiracy theories.”

“It is shocking, but not surprising, that violence is the result. As citizens, we must hold them accountable for their words and the actions that follow,” she continued.

Musk then responded in a since-deleted tweet noting: “There is a tiny possibility there might be more to this story than meets the eye,” while linking to a Santa Monica Observer article.

The report believed that Paul “was drunk” when he was attacked during a fight with a supposed “male prostitute.”

Kimmel was quick to reply to the Tesla CEO’s tweet before it was erased from the platform.

“It has been interesting, over the years, to watch you blossom from the electric car guy into a fully-formed piece of s – – t,” Kimmel penned on Sunday.

When Musk’s tweet was still posted, many fans were shocked that he desired to spread misinformation.

Yael Eisenstat, a vice president of the Anti-Defamation League, said: “When the world’s richest man/owner of this very site himself traffics in conspiracy theories days after claiming to advertisers that he’s going to be a responsible leader, all I can say is: I’m not overreacting by expressing my concerns.”

“Actions always speak louder than words,” she added.

Estimated read time: Less than a minute

AHMEDABAD, India — The death toll from a bridge collapse in Gujarat in India rose to 132, a local government official told Reuters on Monday.

A footbridge over the Machhu River in the town of Morbi was packed with sightseers enjoying holiday festivities when it collapsed on Sunday, plunging people into the river below.

""The death toll in the bridge collapse incident has gone up to 132. The search and rescue operations are continuing,"" said the senior official, NK Muchhar, adding that the toll could rise further.

Armed forces personnel along with national disaster management and emergency teams from nearby districts were deployed to trace missing people and help with rescue operations, Muchhar said.

Authorities said more than 400 people were on and around the colonial-era suspension bridge at the time of the collapse. The bridge had drawn many sightseers celebrating the Diwali, or festival of lights, and Chhath Puja holidays.

A five-member team was appointed to conduct an investigation into the disaster.

The 754-foot bridge was built during British rule in the 19th century. It had been closed for renovation for six months and was reopened for the public recently.

Now this is mind-blowing — literally!

A blonde bombshell named Weronika got the shock of her life when her head “exploded” on an airplane shortly after she’d underwent “cat eye” surgery in Turkey.

“We were on the plane, everything was chill, we’ve gone to sleep because we’d been traveling since 2:00 a.m., and I wake up and I’m in a lot of pain,” said the social media siren, from the UK, in her trending TikTok testimonial.

“Everything was really hurting,” she continued. “I got up, wen to the toilet and I heard this audible pop and my heart was like [beating fast], and I was like ‘What the hell is happening?,’”

In her viral video series, with over a combined 8.8 million views, Weronika — an OnlyFans model who boasts a “24-inch waist with a 50 inch ass and 32J boobs” — explained that she’d opted for canthoplasty, or cat eye surgery, just hours before she and her “idiot” boyfriend hopped a flight.

During the cosmetic procedure, the surgeon creates an incision at the outer corner of the eyelid, cuts the canthal tendon, tightens and pulls it into a lifted position, and secures it with sutures before stitching the incision closed. The treatment creates a slightly raised wing at the outer eyelid to produce a sleek and elongated shape.

However, because Weronika was late to her eye appointment, due to an unexpectedly lengthy post-operation checkup with the doctor who’d performed her Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL) surgeon a few weeks ago, she claimed that her “cat” surgeon was rushing, and forgot to provide her with documents indicating that she had medical clearance for air travel.

And without the proper paperwork, the airport staff refused to let her board the plane until she’d been checked by an onsite medical examiner, which cost her $100.

But after getting a thumbs up from the airport physician, Weronika, whose head was bandaged around the circumference, and her boyfriend took their seats on the aircraft, expecting an uneventful trip.

Previous 1 of 2 Next Onlyfans model Weronika claims her head ""exploded"" days after she underwent cat eye surgery due to pressure inside of an airplane. Werokina shared the gory details of her story in a viral TikTok series.

But after hearing that dreadful “pop” emanate form her body, the digital diva knew something had gone horribly wrong.

“The incision that popped is behind my ear, and it was actually quite loud,” Weronika said before mimicking the popping sound with her mouth.

“Immediately after, I start feeling this hot liquid dripping down my neck…obviously it was blood,” she continued, adding that the stream also contained a smelly yellowish substance.

Weronika went on to reveal that her surgeon had place a fluid drain behind her ear during the cat eye procedure. But the liquids, apparently, hadn’t completely voided, which caused her skin to swell and ultimately rip the nylon stitches in the back of her head. She believed the “pressure” in the airplane cabin also contributed to her excruciating eruption.

“When it popped, all the fluid gushed out all in one go,” said Weronika, who tried to stop the bleeding with tissues.

She and her boyfriend decided to keep the bandages and tissues on her head for the duration of the flight, agreeing to assess the damage and contact her surgeon once they had landed.

“I was in so much pain for the rest of the flight,” she confessed. “It felt so hot and all that liquid was draining into this tissue. It was honestly disgusting.”

Weronika claims the swelling in her head caused her stitches to pop, which resulted in blood gushing out of a whole in her head, polish_99/TikTok

Once on ground, Weronika washed the blood out of her hair and snapped pictures of the “big hole” in her head to send to the doctor.

She claimed the surgeon simply advised her not to seek medical attention for restitching, and to continue applying her prescribed antibiotics cream to the area.

“But I woke up the next morning and the hole [was] infected,” she said. “It was oozing this yellow, viscous liquid and it literally stank. It was so gross.”

So, in effort to quell the infection, Weronika’s boyfriend “pressed” iodine into the hole, hoping the disinfectant would help.

Famed Ukrainian sniper Evgenia Emerald — known as her country’s “Joan of Arc” — tied the knot with a man she met at the start of Russia’s invasion.

The 31-year-old sniper and fellow soldier Evgeniy Stipanyuk were married Friday near the front line of the war in a ceremony held in a forest in Kharkiv.

The wedding date was especially meaningful to the couple, as Friday was Defenders’ Day, a public holiday honoring veterans and fallen members of the Ukrainian armed forces. It also happened to be Stipanyuk’s birthday.

A military general officiated the wedding for the pair, who fell in love soon after the war began in February and became engaged in August.

“We understand that every day could be the last one and we don’t want to postpone life for later,” Emerald wrote on Instagram.

In photos shared to social media, Emerald can be seen wearing a long white wedding gown, while her husband opted to wear his military uniform and carry a gun. Instead of flowers, the bride held ears of wheat in her arms.

Dr. Sydney Watson, who claims to be an American-Australian political commentator, took to Twitter last month in an unruly campaign arguing, “If you need a seat belt extender, you are TOO FAT TO BE ON A PLANE”.

Her offensive comments came after she sat between obese siblings on the short-haul American Airlines flight she said someone else had paid for.

Watson’s initial post included two photos of her attempting to show being “wedged” between the two people.

Watson took photos of her seating arrangement during the Oct. 10 flight. Twitter/ SydneyLWatson Watson called her Oct. 10 seatmates “TOO FAT TO BE ON A PLANE.” Twitter/ SydneyLWatson

“I am currently – literally – WEDGED between two OBESE people on my flight,” she wrote. “This is absolutely NOT acceptable or okay. If fat people want to be fat, fine. But it is something else entirely when I’m stuck between you, with your arm rolls on my body, for 3 hours.”

Her tweet was quick to attract viral attention from both sides of the fence, with many saying her plea was entirely uncalled for, while others felt she was justified in her strong stance.

In response to feedback, she later clarified she had asked one of the siblings if they would like to sit together but was told “no”.

“I don’t care if this is mean. My entire body is currently being touched against my wishes. I can’t even put the arm rests down on either side because there’s no f—ing room. I’m sick of acting like fatness to this extent is normal. Let me assure you, it is not,” she wrote.

Watson’s Twitter profile is filled with rants on topics she has problems with, including overweight passengers. Twitter/ SydneyLWatson

She went further to argue obese people should “buy two seats or don’t fly”.

Watson said she was “so upset” by the situation and claimed the flight attendant was “giving me the ‘this is f—ed’ pity expression”.

American Airlines later clapped back at Watson, telling her the company didn’t discriminate against any body type.

Watson even complained she couldn’t use her tray table, as it was touching one of the passengers on the Oct. 10 flight. Twitter/ SydneyLWatson

It went further to explain how its system worked after being probed about why seats were typically sized for “medium” build travelers.

“Our passengers come in all different sizes and shapes. We’re sorry you were uncomfortable on your flight,” the Twitter account for the airline replied.

“We offer a variety of seat sizes and styles, so our customers can select what works best for them,” the airline said.

It included a link to the different seats it offered, including up-market alternatives to basic economy including business and first class.

Seemingly unsatisfied with the airline’s response, Watson replied saying: “we need to talk”.

Watson on Saturday doubled down on her stance and claimed to have “found out” the response from the airline went against its own policies.

“So we are clear – I stand by everything I said,” she wrote in a new tweet.

“And have come to find out what happened to me went against American Airlines own policies regarding overweight passengers.”

Watson went further to demand “some reparations”."

71eb69c2-351f-49fb-819f-57eb73053547,"A fugitive in Australia who made headlines for his highly-identifiable face tattoos was finally arrested Wednesday after two weeks on the lam.

Jaimes Sutton, recognizable by his bizarre forehead “beast” tat, was tracked down in a home in New South Wales around 2:45 p.m. local time, according to news.com.au.

The 24-year-old suspect updated his Facebook profile picture earlier this week to a selfie in which the lower half of his face is covered, the report said.

Sutton’s arrest came after the Murray River Police District was mocked for asking for the public’s help to find the man with the distinctive face tats.

The department posted his scowling mugshot in a Facebook post on Sept. 28 along with the plea for help locating Sutton, who was on the run after skipping a court date for charges of domestic violence assault and property damage. He was wanted on two outstanding warrants.

The post drew a lot of laughs from social media users.

“Keep your eyes open for this man. He’ll be extremely hard to spot in a crowd,” one Facebook respondent snarked.

Others sarcastically inquired about more details to help identify him, like his height, clothing and eye color.

“I’m gonna need a description if you want my help to find him,” one FB user wrote.

Some joked directly about Sutton’s interesting ink.

“When your toddler gets hold of a permanent marker,” a Twitter user teased.

“It reminds me of doing a poster in primary school!” another poster wrote.

While on the lam, Sutton updated his Facebook profile picture earlier this week to a selfie in which the lower half of his face is covered, according to news.com.au.

“Cops won’t even recognize ya now bra,” one person commented sarcastically.

A convicted triple-murderer on Death Row has complained of feeling his ""veins being pushed around inside his body by needles"" after the US state of Alabama failed to carry out his execution last month. Alan Eugene Miller, 57, was sentenced to die on September 22 for the 1999 killing of three men.

The three victims were current and former co-workers of Miller, targeted in a shooting rampage near Birmingham, Alabama. But the execution was called off at the 11th hour after officials failed to locate a vein into which to administer the lethal injection in time. The death warrant expired at midnight on the date set in September before the team conducting the execution could link Miller to the intravenous line. The execution was postponed around half an hour before the deadline.

The state of Alabama pushed for a rescheduled execution date

The US Supreme Court had given the go-ahead for the execution just three hours before, overruling a previous court decision. John Hamm, Alabama corrections commissioner, said the tight time limit resulting from the court’s decision made the assessment of Miller’s veins impossible. He said: ""Due to time constraints resulting from the lateness of the court proceedings, the execution was called off once it was determined the condemned inmate's veins could not be accessed in accordance with our protocol before the expiration of the death warrant.” The Alabama state attorney general’s office said: ""Due to the lateness of the hour, the Alabama Department of Corrections [ADOC] was limited in the number of attempts to gain intravenous access it could make.

“ADOC made the decision to halt its efforts to obtain IV access at approximately 11.30pm, resulting in the expiration of the court’s execution warrant.” Last week, the state of Alabama pushed for a rescheduled execution date. But Miller’s legal team have filed a complaint in which they claim the execution team attempted to find a vein in the Death Row inmate’s foot. New reports claim Miller’s attorneys have filed a complaint after the convicted killer’s “entire body shook in the restraints” during the attempted execution. DON'T MISS:

The Mirror quoted Miller’s attorneys as claiming: ""Mr Miller could feel his veins being pushed around inside his body by needles."" The outlet added: ""Nauseous, disoriented, confused, and fearful about whether he was about to be killed... blood was leaking from some of [his] wounds."" Miller said he submitted paperwork at the Holman Correctional Facility a number of years ago in which he requested to be executed by nitrogen hypoxia rather than lethal injection. But Alabama officials said they had no record of such paperwork for the execution method which has never been used in the US.

Estimated read time: 2-3 minutes

SAN ANTONIO, Texas — A San Antonio Police Department officer has been fired after shooting a 17-year-old boy who was eating a meal in a McDonald's parking lot Sunday, the department said.

The unnamed officer, described by the department as a probationary officer with seven months' experience, was fired for violating the department's ""tactics, training, and procedures,"" police said.

The San Antonio Police Department said in a video statement the officer was handling an unrelated disturbance call at the McDonald's Sunday night when he saw a car he believed had evaded police the previous day and called for backup.

Before backup officers arrived, body camera video released by police shows the officer walk up to the driver's side of the car, open the door, and order the driver out. The visibly startled teen, who was in the driver's seat eating, put the car in reverse and started backing up.

The police officer then opened fire five times on the car, according to the video. As the driver shifted the vehicle to move forward, body camera video showed the officer opening fire an additional five times as the car drove away.

The San Antonio Police Department said the teen was found a block away suffering from multiple gunshot wounds. A passenger in the car was uninjured, police said.

The teen remained hospitalized as of Wednesday, police said, and was charged with evading detention in a vehicle and assaulting the officer, who had claimed he was struck by the door of the car as the teen backed up.

CNN is attempting to determine if the minor has legal representation.

The SAPD said it is investigating the incident and will forward its findings to the Bexar County district attorney, who said in a statement that his office's Civil Rights Division will be reviewing the police shooting and the charges against the teen.

c7c20ca0-4c50-481f-86f6-a45543c1554a,"WASHINGTON – American forces took out an ISIS official wanted for weapons smuggling in a helicopter raid in northeastern Syria, US Central Command said Thursday.

The Wednesday operation led to the killing of Rakkan Wahid al-Shammri, who facilitated the illegal movement of weapons and fighters to support the terror group’s gruesome aims, according to CENTCOM.

US forces also injured one of al-Shammri’s associates and detained two others.

The raid was among the largest the US has conducted in Syria since the mission that killed then-ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2019. Unlike airstrikes, raids involve American boots on the ground in hostile territory.

No troops or civilians were injured or killed in the operation, which took place outside the village of Qamishli near Syria’s border with Turkey. No American equipment was lost or damaged, according to CENTCOM, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East from its headquarters in Florida.

Rakkan Wahid al-Shammri was killed in a US helicopter raid Wednesday. AP

The raid was among the largest the US has conducted in Syria since 2019. AP

“[CENTCOM] is committed to our allies and partners in the enduring defeat of ISIS,” spokesman Col. Joe Buccino said in the statement.

The US has gone after several ISIS officials this year, including a February raid in northwest Syria during which then-ISIS leader Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi killed himself with explosives.

In July, an American drone strike killed Maher al-Agal, who was then the leader of ISIS in Syria."

The Dart probe was crashed into an asteroid last week, seen inset, to test whether the rocks on a collision course with Earth can be bumped off course.

The smash blasted debris from the surface, caught two days later by a Chilean telescope as a comet-like stream of dust.

The trail stretches for more than 6,200 miles and is expected to get longer until it disperses amid all the other space dust.

Scientists are following another asteroid called Didymos to establish if the first asteroid's trajectory changed. Astronomer Teddy Kareta said: ""It is amazing how clearly we were able to capture the structure and extent of the aftermath in the days following the impact.""

Dr Lori Glaze, a boss at Nasa which blew £240million on the mission, said: ""We're embarking on a new era in which we potentially have the capability to protect ourselves from something like a dangerous hazardous asteroid impact."""

Estimated read time: 2-3 minutes

ATLANTA — At first glance, a new image captured by a telescope in Chile looks like a dazzling comet streaking across the night sky, followed by a long, glowing tail. Instead, it's the debris plume created when NASA's DART spacecraft crashed into the asteroid Dimorphos.

Two days after the intentional impact on Sept. 26, a U.S. team of astronomers observed the aftermath remotely using the 4.1-meter Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope, or SOAR, at the National Science Foundation NOIRLab's Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile.

They spied a debris trail stretching more than 6,213 miles from the point of impact on Dimorphos. Like the tail of a comet, the dust trail is being pushed away from Dimorphos by the sun's radiation pressure.

""It is amazing how clearly we were able to capture the structure and extent of the aftermath in the days following the impact,"" said astronomer Teddy Kareta at Lowell Observatory in Arizona.

Space telescopes like Hubble and Webb also followed the impact and have shared their first views of what the collision looked like across different wavelengths of light.

And LICIACube, an Italian CubeSat that followed behind the DART mission, has begun to send back images taken from its stunning perspective just a short distance away when the impact occurred.

The Double Asteroid Redirection Test deliberately crashed into Dimorphos, an asteroid moonlet orbiting the larger space rock Didymos, to see whether a spacecraft can change the motion of a celestial body in space.

Smashing success: NASA crashes spacecraft into asteroid in planetary defense test The world had a front-row seat Monday evening as NASA successfully crashed a spacecraft into a distant asteroid to see if it can move the rock, a method that will come in handy should a planet-killing asteroid ever come hurtling toward Earth.

While neither asteroid poses a threat to Earth, the mission was the first test of this deflection technology to see whether it's viable as a mode of planetary defense, in case a space rock is found to be on a path to impact our planet.

Post-impact observations of the double asteroid system will shed more light on the surface of Dimorphos, which had never been seen until the DART event.

These observations also can help scientists assess how much material was blasted away from Dimorphos, the size of that debris and how quickly it escaped into space.

While the spacecraft was successful in colliding with the asteroid, it will take up to two months for ground-based telescopes to confirm whether DART successfully altered Dimorphos' motion.

""Now begins the next phase of work for the DART team as they analyze their data and observations by our team and other observers around the world who shared in studying this exciting event,"" said astronomer Matthew Knight at the U.S. Naval Academy.

Unfortunately shortly after a chorus of boos could be heard reigning down on Wilkins as she made her way through the welcome to country.

Sadly things got even uglier once the game got underway as the cameras panned around the stadium showing the packed crowd.

New South Wales National Premier Leagues (NPL) outfit Sydney United 58 fans in the stands however came under fire from those watching on.

As fans continued to watch the broadcast, they were quick to point out what looked to be fans doing Nazi salutes.

Images of several fans with their right arm raised in an upward motion quickly began to circulate on social media with many disgusted by what they were seeing.

“Sydney United getting to the Final was meant to be a good thing. First NPL club ever to do it. Instead, it exposed neo-Nazis in their own supporter group. Hope the whole club is thoroughly investigated. These people shouldn’t be welcome in Football in this country,” presenter Jake Buckley tweeted.

If the salutes weren’t bad enough, the crowd chants also came under fire from those watching on with fans labeling the entire spectacle “an embarrassment”.

“This is the worst outcome for Aus Football. What should be something of celebration, historic team, semi-pro, making the final. But instead, we’ve got Nazi symbolism and salutes, booing of the welcome to country. What an embarrassment to the game and this country,” football presenter Michael Turner wrote."

Speaking with Interview Magazine about her latest film Don’t Worry Darling, the actress and filmmaker explained the character Frank played by Chris Pine was based on the Canadian psychologist.

“We based that character on this insane man, Jordan Peterson, who is this pseudo-intellectual hero to the incel community,” she told the outlet.

The star explained that incels are “disenfranchised, mostly white men who believe they are entitled to sex from women.”

“This guy Jordan Peterson is someone that legitimises certain aspects of [the incel] movement because he’s a former professor, he’s an author, he wears a suit, so they feel like this is a real philosophy that should be taken seriously.”

During an episode of Piers Morgan Uncensored, available to stream on Flash, the divisive psychologist was asked how he felt about Wilde basing an “insane” character on him.

The claim was made by royal author Angela Levin, who has written a new biography on the wife of King Charles III, due out Sept. 29, titled ""Camilla: From Outcast to Queen Consort."" The author spoke to many of Camilla’s pals, staff and former colleagues, as well as other palace insiders to tell the story of how she became one of the key members of the British royal family.

Levin first meet the now-Queen Consort in 2015. In 2018, she wrote a book titled ""Harry: A Biography of a Prince,"" which was based on her exclusive conversations with the 38-year-old before his marriage to Markle.

My biography of our new Queen will be out on 29 September. pic.twitter.com/tVG9QT1HCY — Angela Levin (@angelalevin1) September 23, 2022

""Camilla warmly greeted Meghan when she came to London,"" Levin wrote in an excerpt published by The Telegraph on Thursday. ""Prince Charles enjoyed talking to her, especially about the theatre and arts. Camilla felt the experience she had from coping with public abuse, press insults and frostiness from the Royal family put her in a good place to help Meghan adjust to the restrictions of royal life and was equally keen to help Meghan find her feet.""

CAMILLA THOUGHT PRINCE HARRY’S IDEA OF BRINGING IN A MEDIATOR TO HEAL RIFT WAS ‘RIDICULOUS,’ AUTHOR CLAIMS

""They had lunches together, and Camilla spent a lot of time offering advice on how to handle the pressure,"" Levin shared. ""She tried to be supportive, was happy to be her mentor and took her out for private lunches. A source at the time told me: ‘She doesn’t want to see anyone struggling, and she is fond of Meghan.’ Meghan, however, seemed bored, was unresponsive and preferred to go her own way, with the result that the Queen Consort’s advice landed on stony ground.""

Levin alleged it wasn’t the first time Camilla attempted to show the Duchess of Sussex her support after she married her stepson in May 2018.

""Meghan had a reputation for being a hard worker,"" Levin wrote. ""Her first solo project since joining the Royal family was contributing to ‘Together: Our Community Cookbook,’ showcasing more than 50 recipes from women from the Grenfell community, published a year after the Grenfell Tower fire of 2017.""

""The Queen Consort and King Charles wanted to show their support and invited the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, plus their friend Lucia Santa Cruz, to lunch at Highgrove,"" Levin continued. ""Lucia recalls: ‘As a surprise, Camilla went out of her way to make sure the lunch consisted only of recipes from Meghan’s cookbook, and that included a very hot salsa. It was a really nice gesture.’ One that made no impact.""

Levin claimed that ""it was a shock"" for Camilla after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced they were stepping back as senior royals in 2020. However, she ""avoided talking about it"" publicly and instead, chose to focus on supporting her husband.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex reside in California with their two children. Following the move, Levin alleged that Harry’s relationship with Camilla has become strained.

She wrote: ""A reliable source has told me that Prince Harry has recently been very negative about Camilla, but believes it ‘could be part of his therapy process to relive certain things, and he may want to blame someone else for his own mistakes. As I understand it, his father and stepmother have become hateful in his mind. I’ve also been told that Meghan has been horrible about her, too.’

""Another source added: ‘What has happened and how [Prince Harry] has behaved has been very upsetting for her. There have been a lot of hurt feelings all around, but like all families, you have to embrace it all and hope it will improve.'""

PRINCE HARRY AND CAMILLA, ONCE CLOSE, ARE 'DISTANT' AMID BOMBSHELL BOOK EXPECTED TO ROCK PALACE: ROYAL EXPERT

According to Levin, America plays a significant role in the future of the monarchy — and not just because the Sussexes live there.

""My source added, ‘The Sussexes are more liked in America than in the U.K., which can damage not only Charles and Camilla but the whole monarchy,"" wrote Levin. ""’The American issue has to be dealt with. The Cambridges have to go to the U.S. to show who the real stars are. As will the Queen Consort and King Charles.""

Royal commentator Hilary Fordwich told Fox News Digital that Camilla could identify with Markle’s struggles in the public eye. As a result, she reportedly wanted to offer a helping hand.

""Having been an outsider and having endured intense media scrutiny herself, Camilla tried initially to be immensely supportive of Meghan,"" said Fordwich. ""According to many in their orbit, ‘Meghan seemed bored’ with all the advice and preferred to ‘do things her own way.’ She neither heeded advice proffered nor followed protocol patterns provided for her.""

KING CHARLES WON’T GIVE ‘OLIVE BRANCH’ TO MEGHAN MARKLE, PRINCE HARRY TO JOIN WORKING ROYALS, EXPERT CLAIMS

Fordwich also pointed out that Harry previously acknowledged how happy Camilla made his father.

""Back in 2005, Prince Harry was quoted as saying, ‘She’s a wonderful woman, and she’s made our father very, very happy ... William and I love her to bits,'"" she said. ""His attitude towards her has certainly soured over the years and hasn’t contributed to his relationship with his father.""

Markle, a former American actress, became the Duchess of Sussex when she married the British prince.

The couple welcomed a son named Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor in 2019. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s departures from royal duties began in 2020 over what they described as the British media’s intrusions and racist attitudes toward the former ""Suits"" star, 41. The family now reside in the coastal city of Montecito, California.

QUEEN ELIZABETH 'EXHAUSTED,' 'HURT' FROM PRINCE HARRY, MEGHAN MARKLE'S DECISION TO STEP DOWN AS SENIOR ROYALS

In the wake of quitting royal duties, they gave an explosive TV interview to Oprah Winfrey in March 2021, in which the couple described painful comments about how dark Archie’s skin might be, before his birth. The duchess talked about the intense isolation she felt inside the royal family that had led her to contemplate suicide. Buckingham Palace said the allegations of racism made by the couple were ""concerning"" and would be addressed privately.

In June of that year, they welcomed their second child, a daughter named Lilibet ""Lili"" Diana Mountbatten-Windsor.

It took years for many in Britain to forgive Charles, 73, whose admitted infidelity and longtime links to Camilla, 75, torpedoed his marriage to Diana, known as ""the People’s Princess."" The glamorous young mother of Princes William and Harry died in a Paris car crash in 1997, five years after her messy, public split from Charles.

But the public mood has softened since Charles married Camilla Parker Bowles in 2005. Since then, Camilla has taken on roles at more than 100 charities, focusing on a wide range of issues including promoting literacy, supporting victims of domestic violence and helping the elderly.

CAN WE TALK? HOW MEGHAN’S REQUEST TO KING CHARLES HAS FARED SO FAR: ROYAL EXPERT

With a down-to-Earth style and sense of humor, she eventually won over many Britons. Her warmth softened Charles’ stuffy image and made him appear more relaxed, if not happier, as he visited houses of worship, unveiled plaques and waited for his chance to reign.

In February, Queen Elizabeth II expressed a ""sincere wish"" for Camilla to be known as ""Queen Consort"" when her son succeeded her. Charles, who had long made it clear he wanted Camilla to be known as queen, thanked his mother for her support.

The monarch passed away Sept. 8 at Balmoral Castle in Scotland. She was 96.

Meghan Markle snubbed Camilla in an offer of friendship after the Duchess joined the Royal Family, claims an explosive new book. The presence of Harry and Meghan at the Queen’s funeral saw their fraught relationship with the Royal Family thrust into the spotlight.

Just a few weeks before Her Majesty’s death, Meghan spoke of her frustration during her time with the Firm, claiming in an interview with US magazine The Cut that “just by existing”, she and Harry “upset the dynamic of the hierarchy"" when they were in the UK.

But according to royal biographer Angela Levin, Meghan could have had a friend in King Charles’s wife, Camilla. Ms Levin claims the Queen Consort greeted the Duchess of Sussex “warmly” when she first came to London.

Ms Levin said Camilla knows ""more than anyone"" how difficult it is to be accepted into the royal fold. She added that Camilla wanted ""to help any newcomer"".

Mr Morgan branded the memoir an ""unexploded bomb"" and suggested the royals are concerned about the allegations that could emerge. Camilla played a pivotal role in the breakdown of the marriage of the Duke of Sussex's parents, King Charles and the later Princess Diana, with commentators suggesting Harry could take a pop at his step-grandmother.

Speaking on his TalkTv programme, Mr Morgan said: ""I think it's going to be like an unexploded bomb when this thing goes off. ""It's going to be something which has been ticking away, ticking away."" ""I know the Palace have been incredibly concerned - much more so now that Charles is King. ""Because they also fear Harry might have a go at Camilla, who's now the Queen Consort of this country, to try and settle score going back to his parents' marriage breaking up.""

Piers Morgan forecasts that Prince Harry will come at Camilla

Piers Morgan sent a warning to Camilla that Prince Harry might hit out at her in upcoming memoir

Speaking ahead of King Charles' accession, royal expert Ingrid Seward said: ""I don't think Harry has a great deal of warmth for her, he waxes and wanes with her.” ""I think William completely appreciated Camilla and what's she done for his father and he has got to know her well and I think he is very, very fond of her."" Ms Seward claimed that when Camilla became their stepmother, Harry and William were “very happy to embrace her, but then it went off the boil a bit”. She added: ""I don't think [Harry] holds her in great respect. I don't think Harry is interested in developing a relationship with his stepmother at this stage in his life.""

Christian Horner has suggested Daniel Ricciardo should be racing next year instead of taking a reserve driver role at Mercedes as back-up to Lewis Hamilton and George Russell. Ricciardo’s former Red Bull boss has pushed Alpine to hand its remaining seat to the Australian.

However, several drivers have also been tipped to take the Alpine seat, including ex-Red Bull star Pierre Gasly. Speaking on the F1 Beyond the Grid podcast, Horner said Ricciardo needed to be “reset” after a difficult time at McLaren.

Horner explained: “I think I probably would (go with Ricciardo) to be honest with you. They obviously know him from a couple of seasons ago and he was very together during his last season there, scoring podiums, and I think he’s the type of guy that, I think you could rebuild him.

“It’s obviously not been a great experience for him (at McLaren) for whatever reason but you just have to think back to some of the drives that he did for us, some of the wins he had, the podiums, some of the stunning overtakes he was capable of… that’s still in there I’m sure, he just needs a bit of a reset.

MELBOURNE, Australia — The Australian Football League says it is investigating ""very serious allegations"" made by Indigenous players that they were racially abused by a coach at Hawthorn in Melbourne. A former Hawthorn player has told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. that he was told by the AFL club's then-coach to terminate his partner's pregnancy. Three Indigenous families involved at Hawthorn during the same man's period as coach from 2005-21 have told the ABC they were bullied and told to choose between their football careers and their families. Indigenous players on Australian rules teams have often complained of crowd abuse at stadiums but this is the first time that a team's coaching staff has faced serious racism allegations.

d8f9135b-dcf9-431c-85b5-2ab61167a915,"Lake Taupo-area scientists in New Zealand raised the alert level of a volcano sitting beneath the country’s largest lake on Tuesday after detecting 700 small earthquakes below the surface since May.

The alert level of the Taupo Volcano, a large caldera volcano located beneath Lake Taupo, was raised to 1 from 0, geological agency GeoNet said in a statement. The agency said that the increase in earthquakes and deformation, or ground movement, indicates volcanic unrest is occurring at the lake.

While this was the first time scientists have raised the alert level of the Taupo Volcano to 1, the agency said there has been 17 previous episodes of volcanic unrest over the past 150 years.

Despite the volcanic unrest and raised alert level, scientists say the chance of an eruption remains very low.

""The earthquakes and deformation could continue for the coming weeks or months,"" the statement said.

New Zealand’s Volcanic Alert Level system is based on 6 escalating levels. While it is intended to describe the current status of each active volcano, GeoNet said that an eruption may occur at any level and that levels may not move in sequence.

The Taupo Volcano last erupted around 1,800 years ago, according to GeoNet, which described it as the most violent eruption in the world in the last 5,000 years.

The beautifully-preserved specimen was recovered from the Gogo formation of rocks in the Kimberly region of Western Australia, which 380 million years ago was a large reef. The position of its organs is similar to that seen in modern sharks, offering new clues into how such anatomy evolved, explained paper author and vertebrate palaeontologist Professor Kate Trinajstic of Australia’s Curtin University. She added: “As a palaeontologist who has studied fossils for more than 20 years, I was truly amazed to find a three-dimensional and beautifully preserved heart in a 380-million-year-old ancestor.”

Prof Trinajstic continued: “Evolution is often thought of as a series of small steps, but these ancient fossils suggest there was a larger leap between jawless and jawed vertebrates. “These fish literally have their hearts in their mouths and under their gills — just like sharks today.” In their study, the team were able to present a 3D model of the arthrodire’s complex, S-shaped heart, which comprises two chambers, the smaller of which sits above the larger. These features, they explained, were advanced in such early vertebrates, offering a unique window into how the head and neck region evolved to accommodate jaws — a key stage in the evolution of our own bodies.

Prof Trinajstic added: “For the first time, we can see all the organs together in a primitive jawed fish, and we were especially surprised to learn that they were not so different from us. “However, there was one critical difference — the liver was large and enabled the fish to remain buoyant, just like sharks today. “Some of today’s bony fish such as lungfish and birchers have lungs that evolved from swim bladders but it was significant that we found no evidence of lungs in any of the extinct armoured fishes we examined.” This, Prof Trinajstic explained, “suggests that they evolved independently in the bony fishes at a later date.” READ MORE: Incredible 113 million-year-old dinosaur tracks revealed after drought

In the study, the researchers teamed up with experts at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation and the Synchrotron Radiation Facility in France. Both neutron beams and synchrotron-generated X-rays were used to scan the fossil — which is still embedded in a piece of limestone — and reconstruct the shape of its innards. The team said that the discovery of these mineralised organs, when considered alongside previous finds of embryos and muscles, makes the arthrodires the most well-understood of all the early jawed vertebrates. Furthermore, they added, it clarifies an evolutionary transition on the line to living jawed vertebrates, which includes the mammals and humans. DON'T MISS:

Paper co-author Professor John Long of Australia’s Flinders University said: “These new discoveries of soft organs in these ancient fishes are truly the stuff of palaeontologists’ dreams.” “Without doubt, these fossils are the best preserved in the world for this age. They show the value of the Gogo fossils for understanding the big steps in our distant evolution. “Gogo has given us world firsts, from the origins of sex to the oldest vertebrate heart, and is now one of the most significant fossil sites in the world. “It’s time the site was seriously considered for world heritage status.”

Jeff Bezos’ wealth plunged by $9.8 billion and Elon Musk net worth dropped by $8.4 billion. Musk remains the world’s richest man with a net worth of $256 billion, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index. Bezos is second at $150 billion.

The wealth of Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Page, Sergey Brin and Steve Ballmer all declined by more than $4 billion, while Warren Buffett and Bill Gates lost $3.4 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively.

The stock market cratered after the release of the release of Consumer Price Inflation, which dropped slightly in August to 8.3% from 8.5% in July, the Labor Department said Tuesday.

However, CPI rose 0.1% on a monthly comparison in August, after holding flat in July, according to government data Tuesday, a disappointing result amid widespread expectations that inflation would fall in the month.

The stock market immediately plunged on the news and the US dollar shot higher as data showed that US inflation slowed less than expected.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 1,300 points Tuesday as the news triggered a rout on the New York Stock Exchange. Tech stocks were savaged, dropping by more than 500 points, or 4.4%.

The price of bitcoin was also battered, dropping 7.34% to $20,161. The crypto is down 41 per cent for the past six months.

The price of ethereum plunged 4% to $2389 and has shed 30% this year.

Biden reacts to inflation report

President Biden struck a positive tone, saying the data showed progress in fighting inflation.

“This month, prices overall were essentially flat, gas prices were down, and wages were up – that’s good news for American families.”

However, he acknowledged “it will take more time and resolve to bring inflation down.”

Fed to hike rates aggressively

But markets reacted negatively to the news that inflation was falling at a slower pace than economists had expected.

The surprise result means it is increasingly likely the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates aggressively.

Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance, told the New York Post: “Inflation is the problem, but the key lies with the labor market.

“As long as unemployment is extremely low and consumers are confident in their spending, it’s hard to imagine a scenario where the inflation problem resolves itself.”

He indicated the Fed would need to make unpopular decisions in order to get prices under control.

“The Fed has the worst problem in the world — it’s a political problem, not an economic problem — and the only cure for the current crisis is one that is politically infeasible,” Zaccarelli said.

“If the Fed thought they were criticized too much by the previous administration (and they were), wait until they see the type of criticism they will be under as they deliberately create an economic scenario where unemployment jumps significantly.”

‘Substantially hotter than expected‘

“Both headline and core US CPI were substantially hotter than expected in August,” Monex market analyst Jay Zhao-Murray said.

He added that this was “leading currency and fixed income markets to embark on a swift and dramatic reversal from recent price action, where traders and investors had largely positioned themselves for a softer inflation print”.

He pointed to core inflation that excludes volatile energy and food prices, which is what Fed policymakers pay particular attention to. This rose by 0.6 percentage points month-on-month, compared to a 0.3-point gain in July.

While markets were already largely pricing in another 75-basis-point interest rate hike by the Fed at its next meeting, there had been hopes that passing the inflation peak would allow the Fed to relent.

However, the inflation figures were “hotter than expected in August and put a chill on some of the peak inflation/peak hawkishness/soft landing chatter”, Briefing.com analyst Patrick O’Hare said.

Stocks, which had rebounded in recent days on hopes that a peak in inflation would allow a rapid end to hawkish rate hikes and thus avoid a recession and attain a “soft” landing of the economy, abruptly turned lower.

World reacts to bad inflation news

Fed boss Jerome Powell has indicated the rate increases would continue until inflation is tamed.

Zhao-Murray said market expectations regarding the Fed’s next rate hike had hardened following the inflation data.

While some were forecasting the possibility the Fed would drop to a half-percentage-point hike, now a 0.75-point increase is seen as the floor and some are forecasting a one-point hike.

Market analyst Michael Hewson said Tuesday’s core inflation figures mean more aggressive rate hikes will be needed to tame rising prices.

“While the narrative of peak inflation may well be still valid, getting it down from these levels is likely to be a much tougher battle,” he said.

Inflation has soared around the globe this year owing to sky-high energy and food bills.

This has been caused to a large extent by supply constraints after economies reopened from pandemic lockdowns and in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The dollar has soared as the Federal Reserve moved earlier and more aggressively than other central banks to raise interest rates and contain inflation."

I made my way with sore feet and an aching back but no regrets, among the very first members of the public who had waited patiently, uncomplainingly and with great camaraderie since before dawn to pay their respects to the Queen.

Some mourners queued overnight to get a chance to see Her Majesty's coffin

By then, the queue was a staggering 2.8miles long, snaking back across Lambeth Bridge like a sea of people and along the south side of the Thames, opposite the Houses of Parliament, all the way into south-east London. Having passed through security, a hush had descended as we passed into the precincts of the Houses of Parliament, leaving us in almost total silence but for the shuffling of feet. In the hall, some 300 of us at a time were directed into two queues, to pass on either side of the Queen’s Royal Standard-decked catafalque. The mood was sombre but proud. No-one spoke. There was a muffled sob or two. The closed coffin towered ahead of us on its dais. As we drew nearer, there was a sudden signal, mourners halted and the guardsmen changed. Beefeaters, their pikes carried reversed as a mark of respect, Blues & Royals and Lifeguards descended into the hall and processed across the chamber to take up the four-strong memorial guard round each corner of the platform. It will be guarded in a continuous vigil by soldiers from units that serve the Royal Household. Their footsteps punctuated the deep silence. As we stood, waiting for the signal to move again, I saw Labour leader Keir Starmer with his wife and children, paying their quiet respects.

The Queen's coffin will lie in state until her funeral on Monday

The guard changed, we moved forward again, my heart beating faster as I stepped within a few feet of the raised platform. Around me, several people bowed their heads, others curtsied, as did I. On the coffin, the Imperial State Crown, a wreath of white roses and dahlias and the Sovereign’s orb and sceptre sparkled in the light from above. It was a scene I had spent hours anticipating. But nothing could quite prepare me for the poignancy and sense of occasion, the sheer majesty of this sombre moment. In total, we spent less than ten minutes inside I suspect more than most will have – due to the changing of the ceremonial guard. Was it worth it? Yes, of course. To be there as history was made. To pay tribute to the only Queen I have ever known in my life. This was a small moment of history for me, but one I will carry with me for the rest of my days. To be among the estimated half a million ordinary people who will file past the catafalque 24 hours a day until 6.30am on Monday before her state funeral. The wait at the weekend has been estimated at up to 30 hours. I doubt that will put many people off. Westminster Hall is a 900-year-old building with a vast timbered roof towering high above. Built in 1097, it is the oldest surviving building of the Palace of Westminster and at the heart of our democracy for nearly a millennium.

Mourners endured the rain to pay their respects

The last person to lie in state like this was the Queen Mother in 2002, when more than 200,000 people filed past to pay their respects over three days. Before that, it was Queen Mary, King George V and King George VI. Winston Churchill was the only 20th century prime minister to have been afforded the honour of a lying-in-state ceremony. That is the sense of history under which we waited today. My day started as I emerged from Trafalgar Square station under grey clouds shortly before 7am. After heavy downpours, a trail of mourners made their way towards Buckingham Palace among early-morning commuters. Crowds three-deep already lined the barriers at Pall Mall. People talked in small groups, some seated in pop-up chairs, clutching cups of coffee to help them wake up. Security guards dressed in high-vis yellow jackets huddled in small groups along the route the Queen’s gun carriage-borne coffin was due to take. Tens of thousands of people had come to pay their final respects to the Monarch, and it was a heartening sight to see. Conscious of time ticking on, I made my way to Westminster to join the queue forming to see the lying in state.

Some Royal fans camped out overnight on the Mall to see the Queen's coffin procession

Its start, on the south side of Lambeth Bridge, had by now stretched halfway towards Westminster Bridge and I joined the line directly opposite the House of Commons, one the first few hundred people to arrive. The mood was tranquil and reflective. There were warm smiles and hellos as we stood ready for as long as it took in order to partake in this momentous day. I had anticipated reverent silence but people, from all ages and backgrounds, we’re keen to share their thoughts, memories and experiences of the Queen. Many were dressed in black, in formal suits, others came in jeans and trainers, dressed comfortably for the impending wait. It did not matter either way. The sense of occasion was keenly felt, the wish to be a part of history.

Nick Kyrgios ' lawyers will seek to dismiss the Australian tennis player's assault charge on mental health grounds. Currently playing in Japan, Kyrgios wasn't required to attend Tuesday's hearing which related to an alleged assault on a former partner.

Kyrgios faces a maximum of two years in prison if convicted, with the alleged incident taking place in December 2021. A hearing took place in Canberra on Tuesday but the Aussie wasn't required to attend and he remains in Tokyo for the Japan Open.

His first match, against Tseng Chun-hsin, is scheduled to get underway on Tuesday morning. One of Kyrgios' lawyers, Michael Kukulies-Smith, claims that they will apply to have the assault charge dismissed on mental health grounds.

That comes after reviewing his client's ""medical history since 2015, including public disclosures of his mental health struggles""."

The 96-year-old monarch's latest setback will raise fresh fears for her health the day after she was pictured in a historic audience with Liz Truss, as she appointed her as the new Prime Minister. Royal expert Robert Jobson voiced his surprise the monarch did not make the virtual meeting.

Speaking to the Australian morning show Sunrise, Mr Jobson said: ""I think something is afoot. ""It's not very clear and they're not going to give running commentary of the Queen but the very fact they used the wording 'doctor's advice' is slightly worrying.

The incident took place at the entrance of Fernandez de Kirchner’s Buenos Aires home, where hundreds of protesters have gathered in recent days to support the former president, who is in the midst of a corruption trial.

The economy minister, Sergio Massa, called the incident an “attempted assassination.”

“When hate and violence prevail over debate, societies are destroyed and situations like these arise: attempted assassination,” he said on Twitter.

A police spokesman told Reuters that an armed man had been arrested near the residence and “a weapon was found a few metres from the scene.” He said the man could be of Brazilian origin.

Television footage had shown that no shots were fired after the man pointed a gun at Fernandez in the middle of a crowd. Media noted that the man appeared middle-aged.

The Clarin newspaper reported that the gun was loaded, citing official sources. Reuters could not independently confirm this.

Government and opposition leaders, as well as politicians from other Latin American countries, expressed solidarity with Fernandez de Kirchner, who has been a divisive political figure and served as president for two terms between 2007 and 2015.

Her successor, Mauricio Macri, said the incident required “immediate and profound clarification by justice system and security forces.”

“Cristina is the victim of a criminal fascist who does not know how to respect differences,” added Brazil’s Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the front-runner in next month’s presidential election. “Thank God she escaped unharmed.”

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, Europe’s largest, has been occupied by Russian forces since early in the war, and continued fighting nearby has heightened fears of a catastrophe that could affect nearby towns in southern Ukraine or beyond. (Evgeniy Maloletka, Associated Press)

Estimated read time: 3-4 minutes

KYIV, Ukraine — Authorities began distributing iodine tablets to residents near Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant Friday in case of a radiation leak, amid mounting fears that the fighting around the complex could trigger a catastrophe.

The move came a day after the plant was temporarily knocked offline because of what officials said was fire damage to a transmission line. The incident heightened dread of a nuclear disaster in a country still haunted by the 1986 explosion at Chernobyl.

Continued shelling was reported in the area overnight, and satellite images from Planet Labs showed fires burning around the complex — Europe's biggest nuclear plant — over the last several days.

Iodine tablets, which help block the absorption of radioactive iodine by the thyroid gland in a nuclear accident, were issued in the Ukrainian-controlled city of Zaporizhzhia, about 27 miles from the plant. A woman and her small daughter were among those receiving the pills.

The U.N.'s atomic energy agency has been trying to send a team in to inspect and help secure the plant. Officials said preparations for the trip were underway, but it remained unclear when it might take place.

The Zaporizhzhia plant has been occupied by Russian forces and run by Ukrainian workers since the early days of the 6-month-old war. The two sides have repeatedly accused each other of shelling the site.

In Thursday's incident, Ukraine and Russia blamed one another for the transmission-line damage that knocked the plant off the power grid.

Exactly what went wrong was not clear, but Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy said the plant's emergency backup diesel generators had to be activated to supply electricity to operate the complex.

The plant requires power to run the reactors' vital cooling systems. A loss of cooling could lead to a nuclear meltdown.

Ukrenergo, Ukraine's transmission system operator, reported Friday that two damaged main lines supplying the plant with electricity had resumed operation, ensuring a stable power supply.

The country's nuclear power agency, Energoatom, said the plant had been reconnected to the grid and was producing electricity ""for Ukraine's needs.""

""The nuclear workers of Zaporizhzhia power plant are real heroes! They tirelessly and firmly uphold the nuclear and radiation safety of Ukraine and the whole of Europe on their shoulders,"" the agency said in a statement.

Russia-installed officials in the Zaporizhzhia region, however, said that the plant was supplying electricity only to Russia-controlled areas of the country and not the rest of Ukraine.

Concerns about the site have reverberated across Europe.

French President Emmanuel Macron said a visit by the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency should be allowed to take place ""very quickly,"" warning: ""Civilian nuclear power must not be an instrument of war.""

Lana Zerkal, an adviser to Ukraine's energy minister, told Ukrainian media that the logistics for a U.N. agency visit were still being worked out. Zerkal accused Russia of trying to sabotage the visit.

Ukraine has claimed Russia is using the plant as a shield by storing weapons there and launching attacks from around it. Moscow, for its part, accuses Ukraine of recklessly firing on the place.

Zaporizhzhia's reactors are protected by thick, reinforced concrete containment domes that experts say can withstand an errant artillery shell. Many of the fears center instead on a possible loss of the cooling system, and also the risk that an attack on the cooling ponds where spent fuel rods are kept could scatter radioactive material.

Continued Russian shelling of Nikopol, a city across the Dnieper River from the Zaporizhzhia plant, damaged 10 houses, a school and a health care facility but caused no injuries, Dnipropetrovsk Gov. Valentyn Reznichenko said.

Ranked-choice voting was adopted in Alaska in 2020 and has been hailed by proponents as a novel system to reduce partisanship and ensure that winning candidates have a majority of support.

Voters rank candidates in order of preference. If a candidate receives more than 50% of first-place votes after the first tabulation, then they win, but if there is no majority winner, then the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated.

In the next tabulation, voters who chose the eliminated candidate as their top pick will have their votes go to their second-place pick. This process is repeated until one candidate receives a majority of the votes.

Palin called the system a ""new crazy, convoluted, confusing"" way to elect lawmakers that has ""disenfranchised 60% of Alaska voters.""

""Ranked-choice voting was sold as the way to make elections better reflect the will of the people. As Alaska – and America – now sees, the exact opposite is true,"" Palin said in a statement on Thursday.

""With optimism that Alaskans learn from this voting system mistake and correct it in the next election, let's work even harder to send an America First conservative to Washington in November.""

In Alaska's special election, Peltola received 40% of the vote, Palin received 31% of the vote, and Republican Nick Begich received 28.5% of the vote.

Begich was eliminated, and a second tabulation gave Peltola 51.5% of the vote to Palin's 48.5%, so Peltola won.

7317e13d-892f-419f-9940-1648f582143d,"Taiwan’s military fired warning shots at drones from China flying over its outposts just off the Chinese coastline, underscoring heightened tensions and the self-ruled island’s resolve to respond to new provocations.

Taiwan’s forces said in a statement that troops took the action on Tuesday after drones were found hovering over the Kinmen island group.

The statement Wednesday referred to the unmanned aerial vehicles as being of “civilian use,” but gave no other details. It said the drones returned to the nearby Chinese city of Xiamen after the shots were fired. Taiwan previously fired only flares as warnings.

The incident comes amid heightened tensions after China fired missiles into the sea and sent planes and ships across the dividing line in the Taiwan Strait earlier this month. It followed angry rhetoric from Beijing over a trip to Taiwan by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the highest-ranking U.S. dignitary to visit the island in 25 years.

China claims Taiwan as its own territory and its recent actions have been viewed as a rehearsal of a possible blockade or invasion. China’s drills brought strong condemnation from Taiwan’s chief ally, the U.S., along with fellow regional democracies such as Australia and Japan. Some of China’s missiles early in August fell into nearby Japan’s exclusive economic zone.

Taiwan maintains control over a range of islands in the Kinmen and Matsu groups in the Taiwan Strait, a relic of the effort by Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalists to maintain a foothold on the mainland after being driven out by Mao Zedong’s Communists amid civil war in 1949.

Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said China’s actions failed to intimidate the island’s 23 million people, saying they had only hardened support for the armed forces and the status quo of de-facto independence.

Officials said anti-drone defenses were being strengthened, part of a 12.9% increase in the Defense Ministry’s annual budget next year. The government is planning to spend an additional 47.5 billion New Taiwan dollars ($1.6 billion), for a total of 415.1 billion NTD ($13.8 billion) for the year.

The U.S. is also reportedly preparing to approve a $1.1 billion defense package for Taiwan that would include anti-ship and air-to-air missiles to be used to repel potential Chinese invasion attempt.

Following the Chinese drills, the U.S. sailed two warships through the Taiwan Strait, which China has sought to designate as its sovereign waters. Foreign delegations from the U.S., Japan and European nations have continued to arrive to lend Taipei diplomatic and economic support.

Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey is currently visiting Taiwan to discuss production of semiconductors, the critical chips that are used in everyday electronics and have become a battleground in the technology competition between the U.S. and China.

Ducey is seeking to woo suppliers for the new $12 billion Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. (TSMC) plant being built in his state.

Last week, the Indiana governor visited Taiwan on a similar mission.

Taiwan produces more than half the global supply of high-end processor chips. China’s firing of missiles during its exercises disrupted shipping and air traffic, and highlighted the possibility that chip exports might be interrupted."
fa198b80-975e-4fda-bf07-78fcf1a7d61b,"National Security Council Coordinator John Kirby confirmed that the United States is aware of reports of Chinese drones flying near Taiwanese airspace and accused China of trying to ""permanently alter"" the ""status quo"" in the region.

""We've certainly noted the reports coming out of Taiwan about the overflight,"" Kirby said during a gaggle with reporters on Wednesday following reports that Taiwan fired warning shots at Chinese drones encroaching on Taiwanese airspace this week.

""What we have seen before the Speaker's visit, during that visit, and after that visit is a clear attempt by the Chinese to permanently alter the status quo in and around Taiwan and to sort of set a new normal for their activities and behaviors, be that behavior crossing over the medium line with air and maritime assets or in this case, overflight by unmanned aerial systems.""

Kirby explained that the United States has been ""very clear publicly that changing the status quo is unacceptable"" and ""we're not going to recognize it"" or ""abide by it.""

The drone incident took place on the Kinmen island group, a Taiwan-held region just 9 miles from the Chinese coast.

A statement from the Taiwanese military described the drones as ""civilian use.""

The reports represent the latest threatening gesture from China following House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan earlier this month, which sparked immediate backlash from Beijing. Chinese officials perceived the visit as a threat to the ""One China"" policy and Beijing's longstanding claim to ownership of the island.

""What we said many weeks ago in advance of the speaker's visit, that it was entirely likely that the Chinese would use that visit as a pretext, an excuse to do exactly what they're doing now, which is these sort of new normal behaviors,"" Kirby said Wednesday. ""And that's what we're – that's what we're seeing sort of, sort of playing out. But they're unacceptable. We're not going to and we're not simply going to stop refuting their legitimacy.""

Whether it’s waking up in the morning and preparing for the fresh-feeling four day week or settling in at the end of a long day, a hot drink has always served as psychological preparation or relaxation. However, certain hot drinks can provide more than just psychological comforts, some can help increase longevity and improve someone’s overall health according to a bevy of scientists. In recent years, there has been a quest by groups of researchers to understand the health benefits of the likes of tea and coffee and how these everyday beverages can result in extraordinary outcomes. According to the latest study, a long-serving favourite of the British public, once the nation’s most popular drink, could reduce your risk of a premature death by around nine to 13 percent.

The drink in question is not coffee, now the nation’s favourite drink, but tea. The research, published in the journal the Annals of Internal Medicine, suggests that two or more cups of tea a day is associated with a reduced risk of mortality.

Furthermore, the results suggested this was regardless of whether or not the tea contained milk or sugar and did not change depending on the temperature of the tea in question.

The researchers came to their conclusions after analysis of data from the UK Biobank. Of those in the system, around 85 percent of the 500,000 participants between the ages of 40 to 69 said they drank tea regularly.

Said study of tea was conducted over a four-year period from 2006 to 2010 with participants followed up over the succeeding 10 years. It was from this following up period that the conclusions were drawn as the impact of tea drinking habits was seen.

Nick Kyrgios has progressed to the second round of the US Open after beating Thanasi Kokkinakis, setting up a second round clash with Frenchman Benjamin Bonzi. The Australian described his win this week as ""the most uncomfortable match"" in his career due to the close friendship he shares with his first round opponent. He added: ""When we both saw the draw, it was a nightmare, honestly. I feel like there's probably two players - two or three players - that after tennis I'm probably going to stay in contact with till I probably die, to be honest.

""Thanasi is one of them. It's just really hard. [Trying to block out my opponent] kind of helped me."" Kyrgios is adored by many fans for his flair on the court, but others are not so fond of his temper. On numerous occasions over the years, he has clashed with opponents, umpires and even spectators. This was on display on a number of occasions at Wimbledon, including Kyrgios' match with Stefanos Tsitsipas. Tsitsipas angered Kyrgios when he tried to hit him with the ball, and Kyrgios as a result launched a furious tirade at the umpire to try and get his opponent disqualified.

Nick Kyrgios news: Kyrgios is a controversial figure

Pat Cash, a fellow Australian and legend of tennis, criticised his compatriot at the time in a discussion with John McEnroe. Speaking on the BBC, he said: ""He's brought tennis to the lowest level I can see as far as gamesmanship, cheating, manipulation, abuse, aggressive behaviour to umpires, to linesmen. ""He was lucky to even get through the first set. He should have been defaulted in the first set. ""Something's got to be done about it. It's just an absolute circus. ""Is it entertaining? Yeah, possibly. It's gone to the absolute limit now."" READ MORE: Novak Djokovic issued 'circumstance' warning after US Open ban

Conversely, while commentating for ESPN, McEnroe said of Kyrgios: ""It's embarrassing. He doesn't need to do all this. ""It's scary how good he is. That's what's sad in a way."" McEnroe knows a thing or two about arguing with umpires. His famous 1981 Wimbledon outburst continues to be recalled more than 40 years after it happened. A month after his criticism of Kyrgios, McEnroe spoke to The Guardian and discussed the Australian's behaviour. He admitted that watching Kyrgios made him question his own behaviour when he was a player, and said: “Every time I watch Nick and he pulls some stunt, I think: ‘Did I do that? Was I that bad?’ It definitely brings back those types of memories and feelings."" DON'T MISS

Kyrgios, 27, advanced to his first final appearance at a major in July, when he lost the Wimbledon title to Novak Djokovic after four grueling sets. But he says a different result in that game would’ve led him to skipping the final major of the year.

""Staying in a single spot for two to three weeks can be exhausting. And to know that I can do that and go about things the right way and take every practice session, every recovery session, the right way, it’s confidence in the back of my mind,"" he said of what reaching the final meant to him.

""But also, I’m the type of player that if I had won Wimbledon, I probably wouldn’t have played the U.S. Open.""

Since Wimbledon, Kyrgios has gone on to win the men’s doubles title at the Atlanta Open with Thanasi Kokkinakis – his opponent on Monday night, the singles and doubles title at the Washington Open, a quarterfinal appearance at the Canadian Open, and most recently a second-round loss to top American Taylor Fritz in Cincinnati.

Kyrgios, the No. 23 seed in this year’s tournament, is looking to make a run after reaching the final at Wimbledon in July, when he was bested by Novak Djokovic. The 27-year-old Australian athlete recently reflected on how that match impacted his perspective on the court.

“I just feel like a bit of a perfectionist at times,” Kyrgios told The Post. “I feel like that Wimbledon final has made me just obsessed with trying to play a perfect point every time when it’s not realistic at all in tennis. … I think I’m going to be a bit nicer to myself and stop expecting myself to play the perfect point every time.”

The first night of the US Open could be an absolute circus.

Not only will Serena Williams play in what could be her final match ever, but right after Williams takes on Danka Kovinic, Nick Kyrgios will play his best friend and doubles partner, Thanasi Kokkinakis, in a contest that can go in about a million different directions.

From a pure tennis standpoint, Kyrgios should win this match going away more often than not. There are plenty of folks backing Kyrgios, who is the fourth-favorite to win the tournament at +1000, to lift the trophy. Not only does he have the skill set to excel on the fast courts in Flushing, but he’s enjoyed an incredible summer that saw him finish runner-up at Wimbledon, winning a title in Washington, and then beating World No. 1 Daniil Medvedev before losing in the quarterfinals in Montreal to end a streak of 15 wins in 16 matches. At times over the summer, Kyrgios has been unplayable, thanks in large part to the best serve on tour.

US Open predictions and tennis picks

In a vacuum, a matchup with Thanasi Kokkinakis should suit Kyrgios. Both players do the same things well — they’re athletic, aggressive, and have tremendous first serves — but Kyrgios is better at every facet of the game.

But so much of Kyrgios’ matches are not just about tennis. The 27-year-old is a showman as much an athlete and often takes the former more seriously than the latter. Kyrgios is at risk of losing his head at any moment against any opponent, so who knows where he’ll be at mentally for a showdown with his best mate.

And while it’s always worth taking everything Kyrgios says with a grain of salt — like when he admitted he’s thrown matches after painful losses by his beloved Boston Celtics — his pre-tournament media availability probably gave some punters second thoughts about potentially backing him.

“A big part of me just wants the US Open to be over so I can go home,” he said on Sunday.

As for Kokkinakis, a win over Kyrgios would be one of the biggest of his career to date. The 26-year-old native of Adelaide, South Australia, has a 1-3 record at the US Open and has never made it past the third round of any Grand Slam in his career.

Betting on Sports

If his first-serve is on Kokkinakis can cause any opponent some issues. Two weeks ago, he gave World No. 12 all he could handle in a three-set loss in Cincinnati. But if Kokkinakis is to take three out of five sets from Kyrgios, he’ll not only need to be on his game, but he’ll need Kyrgios’ head to be elsewhere, too.

Both Kyrgios and Kokkinakis should be able to rack up cheap points on their serve. The two Aussies can dial it up with the best of them and the fast courts at Arthur Ashe Stadium should only add to that. Thus, we’re likely to see a tie-break or two and neither player get blown out in any set. These are all good ingredients for a bet on the Over 36.5 games.

In addition to a play on the over, it’s well worth a sprinkle on Kokkinakis to pull the upset. Not only does he have the toolkit to, at the very least, compete with anybody in these conditions, Kyrgios’ mental approach for a match with his best mate is anybody’s guess. He could come out and make quick work of Kokkinakis, or he could goof off and emphasize entertaining the crowd more than winning.

Tennis Abstract gives Kokkinakis a 20.4% chance of pulling the upset, but his odds imply he has a 16.7% chance. There’s value in the underdog on Monday night.

The crooner, 73, underwent a 12-hour surgery to remove a cancerous growth medics recently detected, his family said in a statement.

“We have recently discovered that John has a cancerous growth,” the singer’s wife Jill Billman, and their two adult sons, Robert and James, said in the statement obtained by ABC.

“He has been admitted to hospital this morning for surgery and ongoing treatment,” his loved ones added.

Farnham, who is best known for his Aussie anthem “You’re the Voice,” also provided a statement to fans, saying that cancer is something “so many people face every single day.”

“The one thing I know for sure is that we have the very best healthcare professionals in Victoria, and we can be grateful for that. I know I am,” the singer said.

His family did not reveal the type of cancer he is battling.

The worrying news comes after Farnham was plagued with yet another health woe in 2019.

In 2019, he told The Daily Telegraph he was forced to cut his tour short following a “severe” kidney infection.

“I didn’t realize until too late,” he told the outlet of his condition at the time. I’d been feeling uncomfortable. My wife Jill had been telling me to go to the doctor.”

He said the ordeal forced him to “wake-up call to look after myself a bit more.”

It comes just weeks after Farnham was left heartbroken over the death of his longtime friend, Olivia Newton-John.

The “Grease” legend died earlier this month following a long battle with cancer, as Farnham paid tribute on social media.

“Behind that iconic smile was a tenacious fighter. A beautiful voice and a loyal friend. She will be greatly missed,” the singer wrote on Facebook.

He was the last person to perform on stage with the “Hopelessly Devoted To You” hitmaker. The pair performed three songs together at the Fire Fight Australia bushfire relief gig in February 2020."

Liverpool owner John W Henry has hinted that the club are in the market for a new midfielder after being spotted by fans during the Reds' 9-0 demolition of Bournemouth at Anfield. The club are currently in the midst of an injury crisis in the centre of the park with manager Jurgen Klopp admitting he is hopeful of bringing another body in.

Liverpool have been left with just four players with senior midfield experience with Thiago, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Curtis Jones and Naby Keita all ruled out with injury. Klopp has hence been left with just Jordan Henderson, James Milner, Fabinho and Harvey Elliott as first-choice central options with a variety of youngsters in reserve. The club have been linked with a host of new faces for the position with RB Leipzig star Konrad Laimer the latest name tipped to make the move to Merseyside. Now the Anfield faithful have been given more to get excited about after their record-equalling victory over Bournemouth with owner Henry appearing to hint that the club are set to move for midfielder. In a video posted on Twitter the American appears to give a thumbs up in a fans' direction who had told the billionaire that the club need to sign a midfielder.

Max Verstappen has targeted a podium finish at the Belgian Grand Prix despite the reigning champion set to start from the back of the grid. The Dutchman was fastest on Saturday as he dominated the field to take pole position but has been penalised after taking engine penalties.

But, Verstappen still believes he can fight through the field to secure a top three finish as he fires a warning to Ferrari and Mercedes. He said: “We need to move forward, especially with a car like this it would be ashame not to be on the podium.” Verstappen was the class of the field throughout qualifying and beat Sainz in Q3 by over six-tenths of a second. Charles Leclerc gave his team-mate a tow on his final run but Ferrari lacked pace compared to Red Bulls in Spa.

Nick Kyrgios hopes of winning the US Open have been assessed ahead of the tournament, after the Aussie cemented himself as something of an early favourite. 2013 Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli didn’t sound as convinced that the world No 26 could lift the title despite his successful summer on the grass and hard courts.

Kyrgios has earned himself a spot as one of the title contenders at the upcoming US Open after reaching his maiden Grand Slam final at Wimbledon and backing it up by going on a nine-match winning streak and winning his seventh career singles title. After downing the likes of third seed Stefanos Tsitsipas en route to the Wimbledon final, the 27-year-old lost to Novak Djokovic in four sets.

But he bounced straight back, returning to play the doubles in Atlanta where he won the title with Thanasi Kokkinakis - his partner during his Australian Open doubles triumph. The world No 26 then sweeped the trophies at the Citi Open, winning both the singles title and the doubles alongside Jack Sock.

It cemented the Aussie as one of the early favourites going into Flushing Meadows but former world No 7 Bartoli has now downplayed Kyrgios’ chances of lifting the title at the US Open just days before the tournament begins. “On the US Open, he may have a little less of this dominance that will be present because he will [have] to recover while playing every other day,” she told RMC’s 'Les Grandes Gueules du Sport'.

55a130c4-278f-401c-b57d-0d03fe02cbdb,"Mount Saint Nick is almost always on the verge of erupting, no matter the situation. Take last month’s Citi Open in Washington, D.C.

Nick Kyrgios was playing his first match since reaching his first Grand Slam final at Wimbledon a few weeks earlier. On the first point against unheralded and overmatched American Marcos Giron, he tried — and failed — to hit a shot from between his legs, which was entertaining enough.

A handful of games later, though, with the proceedings still on serve, and after Giron hit a nice but innocuous winner up the line to momentarily get back to deuce, the Aussie collected a ball, turned to the crowd, and launched it so far out of the stadium it might’ve landed in Baltimore.

In earlier times, Kyrgios would have almost certainly gone on to explode and then implode.

But on match point, Kyrgios went to a fan, asked the woman where he should hit his serve, and dispatched Giron in less than an hour before eventually going on to win the tournament without being broken. The title was the 27-year-old’s first of the year and the performance, perhaps, a harbinger of the next two weeks at the U.S. Open.

Welcome to the Nick Kyrgios Show, currently in its best season yet.

Kyrgios has had years with more titles — three in 2016 and two in 2019 — but to say that he is playing anything other than his best tennis, and some of the best tennis of anyone on the planet at the moment, would be to have lived the last couple of months on a deserted island.

“I think I had such a bad experience, and a lot of stuff was going on last year around this time that I just didn’t have a good time on a tennis court at all,” Kyrgios told The Post.

You don’t even have to go back that far for some of the bad stuff.

In July, while in the midst of his run at the All England Club, Kyrgios was charged with assaulting a former girlfriend in an alleged incident last December. The case is due in court in October. If convicted, he faces up to two years in jail.

Back in May, Kyrgios opened up about his mental health struggles, particularly earlier in his career. The dark days included drugs, alcohol, and suicidal thoughts. A few months after that revelation, Kyrgios’ older brother, Christos, wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald that the carefree and engaging kid he’d grown up with was “almost gone,” that he’d become “a prisoner in his own body” and that the two stopped talking for a while.

There were times when he admittedly threw matches. There were innumerable expletive-filled, on-court rants and tantrums over the months and years, too. The most recent outburst came during the Wimbledon final, where, after keeping his poise and cooly taking the opening set against Novak Djokovic, Kyrgios melted down in epic-but-typical fashion. At the time, he berated his own box and pointed out a woman who allegedly called out during one of his serves, labeling her as “drunk out of her mind,” and saying she’s “had about 700 drinks, bro.” (Earlier in the tournament, Kyrgios also spit in the direction of a fan and was fined $10,000.)

Of course, Djokovic went on to collect his 21st career major, second all-time. And the woman who Kyrgios had temporarily tossed, Polish medical lawyer Anna Palus, is now suing for defamation.

But something seems to have clicked with the usually unaccountable and uncontrolled Kyrgios, at least as of late.

On the court, his fitness and practice habits are said to have improved and have become more focused. The Mount Saint Nick eruptions have simmered somewhat as well.

Off the court, he’s come to realize that he’s 27 years old and the opportunities before him don’t come around very often — with no Djokovic or Roger Federer at Flushing Meadows, and Rafael Nadal coming off an abdominal tear, if Kyrgios is ever going to win a Slam, now is the time.

Kyrgios also credits his current girlfriend, Costeen Hatzi, for adding a dose of calm, balance, and support.

“I think just being at peace with your life definitely helps,” Kyrgios said in Washington. “If you look at the most successful players in the world, everything around them is set up and they don’t worry about anything else externally. Their job is just go out there and focus on the tennis court and fight hard and produce tennis, and that’s it.”

There’s no excusing or dismissing Kyrgios’ behavior with regard to the assault charge. If there’s a shred of guilt, he should pay the price for it, because while he can move on, the victim doesn’t get that luxury.

As for tennis, Kyrgios focusing on that is a good idea.

In 11 tournaments this year, he is 31-9. That includes pushing Nadal to three sets in Indian Wells; a straight-sets win over Andrey Rublev in Miami; victories over hated rival Stefanos Tsitsipas in Germany and at Wimbledon; a gritty three-set win over hometown favorite Frances Tiafoe in D.C.; and taking out Daniil Medvedev in three sets in Montreal.

Much of that success can be attributed to Kyrgios’ booming serves — he ranks third on tour in aces and fourth in first-serve points won this season — but the rest of his game has risen as well, in consistency and quality.

Though there are other signs of maturation perhaps, too, however small.

In D.C., away from the view of the camera, he often interacted with fans, especially kids. Between matches, he went sightseeing around the city, posing for pics with Hatzi. And, when it became obvious that the singles title was within his grasp, he didn’t bail on doubles partner Jack Sock, even when it meant playing both finals on the same day. He won that title, too, becoming the first player to sweep both in the tournament’s 53-year history, then thanked everyone involved with the event.

“I just feel like a bit of a perfectionist at times,” Kyrgios told The Post. “I feel like that Wimbledon final has made me just obsessed with trying to play a perfect point every time when it’s not realistic at all in tennis. … I think I’m going to be a bit nicer to myself and stop expecting myself to play the perfect point every time.

“You know, it’s a new experience. Sometimes people play a slam final or win a Grand Slam and they struggle for the next six months, but I feel like I don’t want to be one of those players. I want to be one of those players that rides with it and continues to play well. I don’t want to have any lulls or down matches after a Grand Slam. It’s a small window, so I’m going to use it.”

He needs to now more than ever."

The Justice Department turned over a redacted version of the affidavit to Reinhart on Thursday at noon, after he rejected the government's argument to keep the document under seal, citing the ""intense public and historical interest"" in the FBI's ""unprecedented"" raid of a former president's private residence.

""I have reviewed the Government’s memorandum of law and proposed redactions to the search warrant Affidavit,"" Reinhart wrote in his order to unseal Thursday afternoon. ""I am fully advised in the entire record, including the contents of the Affidavit.""

TRUMP FILES MOTION SEEKING INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF DOCS SEIZED DURING FBI RAID ON MAR-A-LAGO

Reinhart said that after reviewing the Justice Department's redaction, the government ""has met its burden of showing a compelling reason"" and ""good cause to seal portions of the Affidavit,"" saying the disclosure would reveal ""the identities of witnesses, law enforcement agents, and uncharged parties,"" the investigation's ""strategy, direction, scope, sources and methods"" and ""grand jury information"" protected by federal rules.

Reinhart said that after reviewing the affidavit with redactions, he has determined that the Justice Department ""has met its burden of showing that its proposed redactions are narrowly tailored to serve the Government’s legitimate interest in the integrity of the ongoing investigation and are the least onerous alternative to sealing the entire Affidavit.""

Reinhart ordered that the Justice Department unseal the affidavit, with its proposed redactions, by noon on Friday.

DOJ 'TAINT TEAM' EXAMINING TRUMP MAR-A-LAGO DOCUMENTS

Reinhart signed the FBI's warrant for the raid on Mar-a-Lago on Aug. 5, giving the FBI authority to conduct its search.

Earlier this month, Reinhart unsealed the FBI’s search warrant and property receipt from the search.

According to the property receipt, reviewed before its release by Fox News Digital, FBI agents took approximately 20 boxes of items from the premises, including one set of documents marked as ""Various classified/TS/SCI documents,"" which refers to top secret/sensitive compartmented information.

Records covered by that government classification level could potentially include human intelligence and information that, if disclosed, could jeopardize relations between the U.S. and other nations, as well as the lives of intelligence operatives abroad. However, the classification also encompasses national security information related to the daily operations of the president of the United States.

The property receipt also shows that FBI agents collected four sets of top secret documents, three sets of secret documents and three sets of confidential documents.

The property receipt does not reveal any details about any of those records.

The list also includes a ""leatherbound box of documents,"" binders of photos, handwritten notes, miscellaneous documents, miscellaneous top secret documents and miscellaneous confidential documents, as well as other records.

The government conducted the search in response to what it believes to be a violation of federal laws: 18 USC 793 — gathering, transmitting or losing defense information; 18 USC 2071 — concealment, removal or mutilation; and 18 USC 1519 — destruction, alteration or falsification of records in federal investigations.

The allegation of ""gathering, transmitting or losing defense information"" falls under the Espionage Act.

The former president and his team are disputing the classification and say they believe the information and records to have been declassified.

Sources familiar with the investigation told Fox News Digital that the FBI also seized boxes containing records covered by attorney-client privilege and potentially executive privilege during its raid.

Trump and his legal team have filed a motion requesting the appointment of a special master to review those records covered by attorney-client privilege.

But Fox News has learned that a Department of Justice ""taint"" or ""filter"" team has been reviewing documents seized by the FBI since Aug. 8.

The Justice Department’s use of a ""taint"" or ""filter"" team, while standard procedure, could complicate Trump’s legal team’s efforts for the appointment of an independent special master to examine the seized records, as it is likely they have already been inspected by DOJ officials.

d0c3427f-5437-4d00-85e8-eeba36e74ff1,"A Florida federal judge ordered the Justice Department Thursday to make public a redacted version of the affidavit underpinning the FBI raid on former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate by noon Friday.

In a two-page order, Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart said he had accepted the government’s redacted version of the affidavit, which it filed under seal Thursday morning ahead of a noon deadline.

Reinhart, who approved the search warrant authorizing the Aug. 8 raid and said in a Monday ruling that the government had not justified keeping the full affidavit under wraps, wrote in his Thursday order that the DOJ “has met its burden of showing a compelling reason/good cause to seal portions of the Affidavit” that would reveal information about witnesses, grand jury information, or the “strategy, direction, scope, sources, and methods” of the probe into whether the 45th president illegally retained classified information.

The judge also said Thursday that the DOJ’s proposed redactions were “narrowly tailored” and represented “the least onerous alternative to sealing the entire Affidavit.” Reinhart did not elaborate on what he meant by “narrowly tailored.”

Search warrant affidavits typically contain vital information from law enforcement officials spelling out why they want to search a particular property and why they believe they are likely to find evidence of a potential crime there.

However, the judge had warned earlier this week the extent of the government’s approved redactions could render the document “meaningless.”

On Monday, Reinhart cited “the intense public and historical interest in an unprecedented search of a former President’s residence” as grounds for releasing a redacted version of the affidavit.

The Justice Department’s top counterintelligence official, Jay Bratt, had argued to Reinhart during a hearing last week that the affidavit should be kept sealed due to the “volatile situation with respect to this search across the political spectrum — but on one side in particular.”

“The government is very concerned about the safety of the witnesses in these cases and the impact of all the attention on these witnesses on other witnesses,” he added.

Trump has called for the release of the affidavit, and multiple news outlets have submitted filings seeking to make it public.

The former president raged against the raid on his Truth Social platform Thursday, saying, “The Justice Department and FBI are ‘leaking’ at levels never seen before – and I did nothing wrong!!!”

“They illegally Raided my home, and took things that should not have been taken. They even broke into my safe, an unthinkable act!” he added.

Federal agents took 27 boxes from Mar-A-Lago, including 11 sets of classified documents that were labeled top secret, secret, or confidential, according to an inventory list made public by Reinhart on Aug. 12.

The warrant, unsealed on the same day, authorized the FBI to seize “all physical documents and records constituting evidence, contraband, fruits of crime, or other items illegally possessed.”

The warrant also indicated that Trump was being investigated for potentially violating three federal laws pertaining to official records, including the Espionage Act of 1917 — a law used in recent years to justify harsh sanctions, including against whistleblowers.

Trump and his attorneys have both said the former president used his power to declassify the now-seized material before leaving the White House in January 2021."

For yelling “It’s a f – – king joke” in earshot of little Prince George, the angsty Aussie was fined $4,000.

During the same match, he demanded that an unruly fan be removed from Centre Court, saying she was “drunk out of her mind” and that she’d had “about 700 drinks.” The woman is now suing him. Earlier in the tournament, he spat in the direction of an onlooker and was fined. All told, he racked up $14,000 in penalty charges in London.

The downturn started at last year’s US Open, when he took an eight-minute bathroom break while playing against beloved champ Andy Murray. Tsitsipas was accused of cheating and Murray said he “lost respect” for the French Open finalist. Over the next two rounds Open crowds piled on, booing him and not helping him in his eventual loss to nice guy Carlos Alcaraz in the third round. “Everyone is suddenly against me!,” he said. His once shiny reputation still hasn’t recovered.

Estimated read time: 4-5 minutes

KYIV, Ukraine — Russian forces Wednesday launched a rocket attack on a Ukrainian train station on the embattled country's Independence Day, killing 22 people, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said after warning for days that Moscow might attempt ""something particularly cruel"" this week.

The lethal attack took place in Chaplyne, a town of about 3,500 people in the central Dnipropetrovsk region, Ukrainian news agencies quoted Zelenskyy as telling the U.N. Security Council via video. The president's office also reported that an 11-year-old child was killed by rocket fire earlier in the day in the settlement.

""Chaplyne is our pain today,"" Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the nation.

At one point, Zelenskyy put the number of wounded at about 50. The deputy head of Zelenskyy's office later said 22 people were wounded in the attack, which hit five passenger rail cars.

Ukraine had been bracing for especially heavy attacks around the national holiday that commemorates Ukraine's declaration of independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Wednesday also marked the six-month point in the war.

Days ahead of Independence Day, Kyiv authorities banned large gatherings in the capital through Thursday for fear of missile strikes.

Residents of Kyiv, which has been largely spared in recent months, woke up Wednesday to air raid sirens, but no immediate strikes followed. As the day wore on, Russian bombardments were reported in the country's east, west and center, with the most serious attack apparently at the train station.

Outgoing British Prime Minister Boris Johnson marked the holiday with a visit to Kyiv — his third since the war broke out — and other European leaders used the occasion to pledge unwavering support for Ukraine, locked in a battle that was widely expected to be a lightning conquest by Moscow but has turned into a grinding war of attrition. U.S. President Joe Biden announced a new military aid package of nearly $3 billion to help Ukrainian forces fight for years to come.

Over the weekend, Zelenskyy cautioned that Russia ""may try to do something particularly nasty, something particularly cruel"" this week. He repeated the warnings ahead of the train station attack, saying, ""Russian provocations and brutal strikes are a possibility.""

Nevertheless, a festive atmosphere prevailed during the day at Kyiv's Maidan square as thousands of residents posed for pictures next to burned-out Russian tanks put on display. Folk singers set up, and many revelers — ignoring the sirens — were out and about in traditionally embroidered dresses and shirts.

Others were fearful.

""I can't sleep at night because of what I see and hear about what is being done in Ukraine,"" said a retiree who gave only her first name, Tetyana, her voice shaking with emotion. ""This is not a war. It is the destruction of the Ukrainian people.""

In a holiday message to the country, Zelenskyy exulted over Ukraine's success in fending off Moscow's forces since the invasion, saying: ""On Feb. 24, we were told: You have no chance. On Aug. 24, we say: Happy Independence Day, Ukraine!""

Britain's Johnson urged Western allies to stand by Ukraine through the winter.

""This is not the time to put forward flimsy negotiating proposals,"" he said. ""You can't negotiate with a bear when it's eating your leg or with a street robber when he has you pinned to the floor.""

A car bombing outside Moscow that killed the 29-year-old daughter of right-wing Russian political theorist Alexander Dugin on Saturday also heightened fears that Russia might intensify attacks on Ukraine this week. Russian officials have blamed Ukraine for the death of Darya Dugina, a pro-Kremlin TV commentator. Ukraine has denied any involvement.

Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces have encountered unexpectedly stiff Ukrainian resistance in their invasion and abandoned their effort to storm the capital in the spring. The fighting has turned into a slog that has reduced neighborhoods to rubble and sent shock waves through the world economy.

Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, speaking Wednesday at a meeting of his counterparts from a security organization dominated by Russia and China, claimed the slow pace of Moscow's military action was due to what he said was an effort to spare civilians.

On Feb. 24, we were told: You have no chance. On Aug. 24, we say: Happy Independence Day, Ukraine! –President Volodymr Zelenskyy

Russian forces have repeatedly targeted civilian areas in cities, including hospitals and a Mariupol theater where hundreds of people were taking shelter.

But Shoigu said Russia is carrying out strikes with precision weapons against Ukrainian military targets, and ""everything is done to avoid civilian casualties.""

""Undoubtedly, it slows down the pace of the offensive, but we do it deliberately,"" he said.

On the battlefield, Russian forces struck several towns and villages in Donetsk province in the east over 24 hours, killing one person, authorities said. A building materials superstore in the city of Donetsk was hit by a shell and erupted in flames, the mayor said. There were no immediate reports of any injuries.

In the Dnipropetrovsk region, the Russians again shelled the cities of Nikopol and Marhanets, damaging several buildings and wounding people, authorities said. Russian troops also shelled the city of Zaporizhzhia, but no casualties were reported.

In addition, Russian rockets struck unspecified targets in the Khmelnytskyi region, about 180 miles west of Kyiv, the regional governor said. Attacks there have been infrequent.

Donna Brain, from Melbourne, Australia, had planned to put the money towards a new home following a painful divorce.

“I don’t even know how it happened. After everything I’ve gone through, I just wanted a nice house to live in,” a tearful Brain told Channel 7.

The incident has highlighted just how sophisticated scammers have become.

Brain was all set to move into a new home following her marriage break-up when a curious transaction occurred on her Commonwealth Bank account.

A sum of $147 was transferred to the 56-year-old nurse’s account under a mysterious name that she didn’t recognize.

Scammer pretended to be Donna Brain’s bank and asked for her to transfer money back — stealing her account information in the process. Channel 7

Then came a phone call, purportedly from her bank, where Brain was asked to return the $147 which – it was claimed – had been sent to her by accident.

“They didn’t ask for any NetBank numbers or passwords,” she said.

But the information the criminals now had was enough.

Initially, a withdrawal of $350 was made from Brain’s account. When they went through successfully, more withdrawals followed.

“They transferred six lots of $14,000 and then $56,000,” she said.

Bank scams are on the rise with shady phone calls, suspect emails and even fake websites that mimic the sites of established banks and are there to fool you into handing over you passwords and account details.

People should always be wary if someone they don’t know or even someone saying they are form a company they’ve head of pressures them into making a payment or handing over any personal information.

Commonwealth Bank refunded Brain’s $140,000 and her house move is back on.

However, banks have warned that they are not always able to pay back cash that has been stolen from accounts by scammers. So people should always stop and think if that unsolicited call from the bank, unexpected email or strange transaction is all above board."

Former Secretary General of NATO Lord George Robertson reacted to Putin’s agreement to let international inspectors into Zaporizhzhia nuclear plat amid fears of radioactivity releases and said the move might suggest that common sense has now reached the Kremlin. Despite acknowledging that it is “difficult to trust anything that Russians say”, he assessed that Putin’s inspections concession at the nuclear plant might indicate that Russians are not going to anything aggressive at Zaporizhzhia as any damage would directly affect Russia and “take any radioactivity from Zaporizhzhia into the heartland” of the country.

Mr Robertson told Times Radio: “We can only judge them by what’s happened rather than their promises, but you know that grain ships are now leaving Odessa. “In one way this is an illustration of the fact that common sense has penetrated into some areas of the Kremlin. “The nuclear power plant here is also another one, which is a double edge sword for the Russians. “If anything happened to that nuclear plant, it affects Russia as well.

Putin's decision to let UN inspectors into Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant might indicate 'common sense h

“Prevailing winds would take any radioactivity from Zaporizhzhia into the heartland of Russia. “There is a common interest involved here, and although it’s difficult to trust anything that the Russians actually say, what they’ve done in the past, especially over the grain ships from Odessa, does tend to suggest that they move to their own self-interest before they look at the international interest.” Referring to the situation at the plant, he added: “It’s very worrying because the implications of a nuclear power plant being in the centre of a battle must concern all of us, but the United Nations is involved. “The Russian have now acquiesced to the idea of International inspects getting to the side, and that must be of some reassurance to us that at least the Russians recognise the dangers that are involved here.

“The presence of international observers will have a very significant effect, the world attention is now focused on that. “I don’t think that the Russians are going to do anything aggressive if they’ve now allowed inspectors to get into the site”. The comments came as Putin has agreed to let International Atomic Energy Agency officials enter Zaporizhzhia power plant to run radioactivity inspections. The Kremlin made the announcement after a call between Putin and French President Emmanuel Macros where the latter stressed the need for inspections by intentional observers to assess the situation at the plant.

""That crosshead kick landed perfectly,"" Edwards said.

Usman, considered to be the No. 1 pound-for-pound fighter in the sport, was likely on his way to a decision victory against Edwards before the kick. He controlled Edwards throughout the third round and led on the judge’s scorecard 39-37. But Edwards landed the shocking blow to put the ""Nigerian Nightmare"" on his back.

Edwards has 10 wins and one no contest since he lost to Usman in December 2015 at UFC on FOX 17. The victory over Usman was the 20th of his career.

Tennis fan and Polish lawyer Ania Palus is suing Nick Kyrgios for defamation after she claims the tennis star’s Wimbledon finals outburst caused her “considerable harm.” During the third set of Kyrgios’ loss to Novak Djokovic, the Australian claimed that Palus was distracting him during his serve.

“Why is she still here?” Kyrgios complained to the umpire. “She’s drunk out of her mind and speaking to me in the middle of a game. What’s acceptable? OK, kick her out. I know exactly which one it is. The one in the dress, who looks like she’s had about 700 drinks bro.”

Palus was escorted out of the stadium, but was allowed to return 15 minutes later after having some water. She later said she had only had drunk a Pimms and a glass of Rose.

“I wanted to give him support. Maybe I took it too far… but I only had good intentions,” she said. “It’s the temperature for me, I had no hat. I’m really sorry.”

However, Palus is now hoping to make Kyrgios sorry.

“It was an event we had been looking forward to for some time,” said Palus, who was in attendance at the tennis Grand Slam with her mother.

“During the course of the final, Nick Kyrgios made a reckless and entirely baseless allegation against me.

“Not only did this cause considerable harm on the day, resulting in my temporary removal from the arena, but Mr Kyrgios’ false allegation was broadcast to, and read by, millions around the world, causing me and my family very substantial damage and distress. I am not litigious, but after much consideration, I have concluded that that I have no alternative but to instruct my solicitors Brett Wilson LLP to bring defamation proceedings against Mr Kyrgios in order to clear my name.

“The need to obtain vindication, and to prevent repetition of the allegation, are the only reasons for taking legal action. Any damages recovered will be donated to charity. Given the extant claim, I am unable to comment further on the events of the day in question. I hope that Mr Kyrgios will reflect on the harm he has caused me and my family and offer a prompt resolution to this matter. However, if he is unwilling to do this, I am committed to obtaining vindication in the High Court.”

Palus’ lawsuit is not the only legal issue Kyrgios is dealing with. Kyrgios is facing assault charges in Australia over accusations from ex-girlfriend Chiara Passari. Kyrgios’ lawyer pushed for a three-month adjournment of the case, but was denied by a judge at a hearing on Monday. Kyrgios is now due in an Australian court on Oct. 4 for the matter."
d7de4fde-8fd1-4f9a-a217-61bce8ad29cd,"Real sugar can quickly rack up calories, but artificial sugar may cause diabetes.

Scientists are now warning that some artificial sweeteners can alter the body’s microbes in a way that changes blood sugar levels, according to new data published in the journal “Cell” and reported by South West News Service.

The sugar substitutes — which include saccharin and aspartame — are in thousands of diet products such as fizzy drinks, desserts, ready meals and cakes and can also even be found in chewing gum and toothpaste.

Manufacturers have long denied that the substitutions could have adverse effects on the human body, and experts have previously noted that blood sugar levels aren’t affected by them.

However, the new data suggested that caution may be necessary.

“In subjects consuming the non-nutritive sweeteners, we could identify very distinct changes in the composition and function of gut microbes and the molecules they secret into peripheral blood,” senior author and professor Eran Elinav of the German National Cancer Centre told SWNS.

“This seemed to suggest gut microbes in the human body are rather responsive to each of these sweeteners,” he added.

“When we looked at consumers of non-nutritive sweeteners as groups, we found two of the non-nutritive sweeteners — saccharin and sucralose — significantly impacted glucose tolerance in healthy adults.

Some people use sugar substitutes to cut out calories. Getty Images

“Interestingly, changes in the microbes were highly correlated with the alterations noted in people’s glycaemic responses,” Elinav explained.

The professor’s team identified this same phenomenon with mice in 2014. Curious about what would happen with humans, Elinav and colleagues screened more than 1,300 people and found 120 who strictly avoided artificial sweeteners in their everyday lives.

That bunch was broken into six groups — two controls and four who ingested well below the daily allowance of either aspartame, saccharin, stevia or sucralose recommended by the US Food and Drug Administration.

Sugar subs can affect gut bacteria — potentially altering blood glucose levels, scientists say. Getty Images

Microbial samples from subjects were then injected into germ-free mice raised in completely sterile conditions with no gut bacteria of their own.

The experiment results ultimately suggested that microbiome changes in response to human consumption of non-nutritive sweeteners “may, at times, induce glycaemic changes in consumers in a highly personalized manner,” concluded the professor, who added that the effects of the sweeteners may vary per individual due to the unique composition of one’s microbiome.

Previous research has found that artificial sweeteners could have a bad effect on one’s metabolism and appetite control.

A report published by the American Journal of Preventive Medicine in March also found that vaping could lead to high blood sugar and diabetes."

Known as Thylacine, the carnivorous marsupial once roamed the Australian outback before the last known survivor of the striped species died in 1936. Scientists now plan to use genetic technology, ancient DNA collection, and artificial reproduction to bring the tiger back.

""We would strongly advocate that first and foremost we need to protect our biodiversity from further extinctions, but unfortunately we are not seeing a slowing down in species loss,"" said Andrew Pask, a professor at the University of Melbourne leading the project at the Thylacine Integrated Genetic Restoration Research Lab.

""This technology offers a chance to correct this and could be applied in exceptional circumstances where cornerstone species have been lost.""

ENDANGERED CALIFORNIA CONDORS RELEASED IN REDWOOD NATIONAL AND STATE PARKS FOR FIRST TIME SINCE 1892

The thylacine project is working with technology investor Ben Lamm's Colossal Biosciences and Harvard Medical School geneticist George Church. Lamm's organization has also launched a $15 million project to bring the woolly mammoth back from extinction.

The last living thylacine was named Benjamin and died in 1936 at the Beaumaris Zoo in Tasmania, shortly after the animal species had been given protected status.

The team plans to first design a genome for the tiger and compare it to the dunnart, its closest living relative. Scientists will then use CRISPR gene editing technology to eventually create an embryo.

""We then take living cells from our dunnart and edit their DNA every place where it differs from the thylacine. We are essentially engineering our dunnart cell to become a Tasmanian tiger cell,"" Pask claimed.

Greg Rusedski has raised fears over Nick Kyrgios ’ fitness going into the US Open. The world No 28 has cemented himself as an early favourite for the final Grand Slam of the year after an impressive summer - making the Wimbledon final after back-to-back semi-finals on grass, winning his seventh singles title in Washington and reaching the quarters in Montreal last week. But there are concerns after he suffered a half-hearted 6-3 6-2 defeat to Taylor Fritz

Kyrgios has enjoyed the best season of his career so far in both singles and doubles, and was one of the in-form players ahead of the upcoming US Open. He has now sparked injury fears just 12 days before the final Major of the season after struggling with his knee as he crashed out of the Cincinnati Masters in the second round.

The big-serving Aussie threw in six double faults as he struggled against the 11th seed, complaining about flickering screens and crowd movements in multiple x-rated rants towards the umpire before admitting that he had been bound to run out of steam eventually while needing the physio to attend to his knee.

Former world No 4 Rusedski has now shared his concerns for the 27-year-old with the US Open looming, after Kyrgios suffered his earliest exit since the Australian Open where he lost to Daniil Medvedev in the second round - barring a withdrawal from June’s Mallorca Championships. ""It did unravel,” he said of the Wimbledon finalist’s performance.

17800b24-bcb3-461c-907a-9a1520962b0d,"NASA’s Mega Moon Rocket arrived at the launch pad Wednesday morning as the Kennedy Space Center prepares for the rocket's debut flight in two weeks.

The Artemis moon rocket arrived at the launch pad around 7:30 a.m. EST after being hauled over a four-mile stretch from its hangar in the Vehicle Assembly Building over a 10-hour period. The Space Launch System (SLS) moon rocket measures 322 feet in length and uses a core stage and twin strap-on boosters.

The moon rocket's launch is currently scheduled for Aug. 29 at 8:33 a.m. EST, according to NASA. Three mannequins with sensors will be placed inside the rocket's capsule to measure radiation and vibration.

The capsule is expected to orbit the moon at a distance for several weeks before splashing down in the Pacific. The entire timeline will last approximately six weeks.

NASA engineers and technicians will be working to configure systems at the launch pad over the next several days.

The flight is the first moonshot as part of NASA's Artemis program. NASA is currently working toward a lunar-orbiting flight with astronauts within the next two years as well as a lunar landing by a human crew by 2025.

Wednesday's launch pad trip is the rocket's third so far. An April countdown test was riddled with fuel leaks and equipment trouble, forcing the rocket to be returned to its hangar for repairs. A June dress rehearsal was repeated with positive results.

1d1095aa-acd1-450d-8637-3dc3489735fa,"NASA’s new moon rocket arrived at the launch pad Wednesday ahead of its debut flight in less than two weeks.

The 322-foot rocket emerged from its mammoth hangar late Tuesday night, drawing crowds of Kennedy Space Center workers, many of whom were not yet born when NASA sent astronauts to the moon a half-century ago. It took nearly 10 hours for the rocket to make the four-mile trip to the pad, pulling up at sunrise.

NASA is aiming for an Aug. 29 liftoff for the lunar test flight. No one will be inside the crew capsule atop the rocket, just three mannequins swarming with sensors to measure radiation and vibration.

The capsule will fly around the moon in a distant orbit for a couple weeks, before heading back for a splashdown in the Pacific. The entire flight should last six weeks.

The flight is the first moonshot in NASA’s Artemis program. The space agency is aiming for a lunar-orbiting flight with astronauts in two years and a lunar landing by a human crew as early as 2025. That’s much later than NASA anticipated when it established the program more than a decade ago, as the space shuttle fleet retired. The years of delays have added billions of dollars to the cost.

“Now for the first time since 1972, we’re going to be launching a rocket that’s designed for deep space,” NASA’s rocket program manager, John Honeycutt, said recently.

NASA’s new SLS moon rocket, short for Space Launch System, is 41 feet shorter than the Saturn V rockets used during Apollo a half-century ago. But it’s more powerful, using a core stage and twin strap-on boosters, similar to the ones used for the space shuttles.

“When you look at the rocket, it almost looks retro. It looks like we’re looking back toward the Saturn V,” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson told reporters earlier this month. “But it’s a totally different, new, highly sophisticated, more sophisticated rocket and spacecraft.”

Twenty-four astronauts flew to the moon during Apollo, with 12 of them landing on it from 1969 through 1972. The space agency wants a more diverse team and more sustained effort under Artemis, named after Apollo’s mythological twin sister.

“I want to underscore that this is a test flight,” Nelson said. “It’s just the beginning.”

This was the rocket’s third trip to the pad. A countdown test in April was marred by fuel leaks and other equipment trouble, forcing NASA to return the rocket to the hangar for repairs. The dress rehearsal was repeated at the pad in June, with improved results."

Laura McCulloch, 37, was last seen heading to a restaurant in the beachside neighborhood Santa Monica on Friday and her family at home in Melbourne hadn’t heard from her since.

There was concern about the person she was meeting and that her online dating profile had apparently disappeared and her phone switched off.

A missing persons report was filed with the Los Angeles Police Department.

However, it has emerged that McCulloch was arrested by the neighboring Santa Monica Police Department for “public intoxication and resisting arrest” and taken to jail.

Cops told news.com.au that McCulloch was alleged to have been drunk at a restaurant on Friday, threw a drink at a child, “charged” police and bit an officer.

She appeared before a local LA court on Tuesday.

Laura McCulloch was arrested by the neighboring Santa Monica Police Department for “public intoxication and resisting arrest” and taken to jail. Instagram

Friends’ alarm at missing Aussie

Before her whereabouts were uncovered, McCulloch’s sister Clare told 9News that her friends raised the alarm when she failed to show up after going on a first date with a man she met on either Tinder or Bumble.

“They haven’t heard from her and she didn’t show up to work or her yoga class,” she said.

Laura McCulloch had thrown a drink at a diner and their 2-year-old child.

“Her phone is now off, I’ve been trying to call her as well.

“I’m absolutely beside myself, we all are.

“It’s a total nightmare, it’s so hard to not think the absolute worst.”

Police statement

In a statement to news.com.au, Santa Monica police said officers were called to a “battery” incident at a restaurant on Arizona Avenue near Santa Monica’s famous beach.

They had been told a woman, later identified as Laura McCulloch, had thrown a drink at a diner and their 2-year-old child.

“Upon arrival, officers contacted Ms. McCulloch who showed obvious signs of intoxication,” the statement read.

“While conducting the investigation, McCulloch charged at the officers while yelling expletives.

“During efforts to detain her, she became physically combative, kicked at officers and bit one officer on the shoulder.”

She was taken to Santa Monica jail and booked for public intoxication and resisting arrest.

“Bubbly and vivacious” McCulloch moved to LA from New York and has worked as a nanny between acting jobs.

Her supposed disappearance was reported to the Los Angeles Police Department but Clare said the force would not yet investigate. She instead hired a private investigator to help with the search. The restaurant had said it would not hand over the CCTV until the police are involved.

McCulloch’s last acting credit was in an indie film called “Covid Support Group.”

In March 2021 she played Madame Le Farge in an American adaptation of “A Tale of Two Cities” at Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina.

Before that, she appeared in an Australian film called “The Black Sheep” in 2010, and in 2009 was in ballet film “The Nutcracker."

7b905aa3-0569-45f3-8bf5-8c8b2a32b817,"An Iranian government official claimed Monday that Tehran was not involved in the recent attack on author Salman Rushdie, who was stabbed in New York ahead of a scheduled speech.

In Iran's first public comments addressing the assault, the country's Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said in a briefing to journalists that Iran should not be accused of any involvement.

""We, in the incident of the attack on Salman Rushdie in the U.S., do not consider that anyone deserves blame and accusations except him and his supporters,"" Kanaani said. ""Nobody has the right to accuse Iran in this regard.""

Rushdie was stabbed multiple times before a speech at the Chautauqua Institution in Chautauqua, New York, on Friday. The attacker allegedly rushed onto the stage and stabbed him. Rushdie underwent surgery at a local hospital.

Rushdie has lived under the threat of a fatwa on his life after Iran's late Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini condemned his book, ""The Satanic Verses,"" as blasphemy in 1989 and called for the author's death. The book was also banned in Iran. A fatwa is a decree from an Islamic religious leader.

Iran has offered more than $3 million for anyone who kills Rushdie.

Iran's government has since distanced itself from Khomeini’s decree, but Rushdie still faced opposition. A semi-official Iranian religious foundation raised a bounty for Rushdie in 2012 from $2.8 million to $3.3 million.

Kanaani explained that Iran did not ""have any other information more than what the American media has reported.""

9c0ab3b3-7c5e-4380-99c6-75e664eb64ed,"Freya, a social media famous walrus in Norway, has been euthanized after frenzied onlookers wouldn’t stop trying to get close to her to take pictures.

The 1,320-pound female walrus became a popular attraction in recent weeks — delighting crowds of spectators in the Oslo Fjord by clambering atop of boats, even playfully sinking some — despite repeated warnings from officials that onlookers should stay away from the massive marine mammal.

As recently as last month officials said they hoped Freya would leave the populated inlet on her own accord and that euthanasia would only be a last resort if there was a risk to humans.

Norway’s Directorate of Fisheries said Freya was put down in a humane manner early Sunday “based on an overall assessment of the continued threat to human safety.”

The hulking mammal, who seemed unafraid of people, drew a large following in Oslo, which ultimately led to her death. NTB/AFP via Getty Images

“Through on-site observations the past week, it was made clear that the public has disregarded the current recommendation to keep a clear distance to the walrus,” it said.

“Therefore, the Directorate has concluded, the possibility for potential harm to people was high and animal welfare was not being maintained.”

Walruses are also a protected species.

Authorities said that people had been seen swimming with Freya, throwing objects at her, and trying to get close to her for photos. The Directorate of Fisheries released a photo showing a large crowd of people, including children, standing very close to the walrus.

The head of the directorate, Frank Bakke-Jensen, said other options — including moving the hulking walrus elsewhere — were considered, but authorities concluded it wasn’t a viable option because of the “extensive complexity of such an operation.”

“We have sympathies for the fact that the decision can cause a reaction from the public, but I am firm that this was the right call,” Bakke-Jensen said. “We have great regard for animal welfare, but human life and safety must take precedence.”

Government officials said Freya posed a risk to humans, and relocating her would have been too complicated. NTB/AFP via Getty Images

Rune Aae, a biology professor at the University of South-Eastern Norway who had been tracking Freya’s sightings, condemned the decision to put down the young, seemingly healthy mammal as “too hasty.”

He wrote in a Facebook post that government officials had a boat out keeping tabs on the walrus’ movements and could warn the public at any time not to engage in water activities near her.

“Freya (would have) sooner or later gotten out of the Oslo Fjord, which all previous experience has shown, so killing her was, in my view, completely unnecessary,” he wrote. “Norway is the country that killed Freya after being around for over two years around the entire North Sea. What a shame!”

Freya reached celebrity status far beyond Norway’s shores this summer after videos of her climbing on top of boats in Oslo to bask in the sun went viral.

Freya was videotaped chasing a duck, attacking a swan, and spending hours napping on various vessels too small to support her large frame.

Atlantic walruses normally live in the Arctic, and most are wary of human, but Freya — named after the Norse goddess of love and beauty — seemed unafraid of people.

It is believed that Freya came from Freya from Svalbard — a Norwegian archipelago in the Arctic Ocean more than 1,200 miles away from Oslo.

It is unusual but not unheard of for walruses to travel into the North and Baltic Seas. Another walrus, nicknamed Wally, was seen last year on beaches and even a lifeboat dock in Wales and elsewhere.

In the days since the warrant was executed, the FBI and DHS have seen an increase in ""violent threats"" against law enforcement, judiciary and government personnel, including a particular threat to ""place a so-called Dirty Bomb in front of FBI headquarters,"" according to the bulletin.

""General calls"" for ""civil war"" and ""armed rebellion"" have also increased in recent days on social media.

The bulletin states that many of the threats include references to the claim that the 2020 election was stolen, in addition to other perceived claims of government overreach.

Several of the threats are specific, according to the bulletin, which states that ""the FBI and DHS have identified multiple articulated threats and calls for the targeted killing of judicial law enforcement and government officials associated with the Palm Beach search, including the Federal judge who approved the Palm Beach search warrant.""

The bulletin cites an incident on Aug. 11 when an individual ""attempted to forcibly enter the FBI Cincinnati field office."" The individual, Ricky Shiffer Jr., allegedly fled from the scene when officers responded and then entered a standoff with law enforcement officers and FBI agents. He was shot and killed after the standoff, which lasted six hours.

“A fatwa like that is a serious matter, fortunately the Internet didn’t exist back then. The Iranians had to fax the fatwa to the mosques. That was a long time ago, you know, but now my life is relatively normal again,” he said.

“I think many people today live with similar threats as I did then. And the fax machine that was used against me is like a bicycle against a Ferrari compared to the internet.”

Manchester United owners the Glazers are facing renewed calls to sell the club after Saturday’s 4-0 defeat to Brentford . The Red Devils were comprehensively outplayed, outfought and outmaneuvered by Thomas Frank’s energetic and enterprising side. Yet while the Americans have previously indicated they’d sell if they received an offer of £4billion, there’s still no indication they’re going to walk away.

Manchester United beat Brentford home and away last season.

But there was no repeat on Saturday night, with goals from Josh Dasilva, Mathias Jensen, Ben Mee and Bryan Mbeumo giving the home side all three Premier League points.

It was a horrendous day for United, with the Glazers now facing renewed calls to go in the aftermath of the defeat.

For now, there’s no indication of that happening. There is, however, some movement behind the scenes with Michael Knighton recently expressing an interest in ousting the controversial owners.

And The Mirror revealed last year that it would take a fee of close to £4bn to tempt Joel and Avram Glazer into selling up.

This, it was said at the time, was their minimum price tag for the Red Devils.

Matar's attorney entered the plea on his behalf during an arraignment in western New York. The suspect appeared in court wearing a black and white jumpsuit and a white face mask, with his hands cuffed in front of him.

A judge ordered him held without bail after District Attorney Jason Schmidt told her Matar took steps to purposely put himself in position to harm Rushdie, getting an advance pass to the event where the author was speaking and arriving a day early bearing a fake ID.

""This was a targeted, unprovoked, pre-planned attack on Mr. Rushdie,"" Schmidt said.

Public defender Nathaniel Barone complained that authorities had taken too long to get Matar in front of a judge while leaving him ""hooked up to a bench at the state police barracks.""

""He has that constitutional right of presumed innocence,"" Barone added.

The attack was met with shock and outrage from much of the world, along with tributes and praise for the award-winning author who for more than 30 years has faced death threats for ""The Satanic Verses.""

Authors, activists and government officials cited Rushdie's courage and longtime advocacy of free speech despite the risks to his own safety. Writer and longtime friend Ian McEwan called Rushdie ""an inspirational defender of persecuted writers and journalists across the world,"" and actor-author Kal Penn cited him as a role model ""for an entire generation of artists, especially many of us in the South Asian diaspora toward whom he’s shown incredible warmth.""

President Joe Biden said Saturday in a statement that he and first lady Jill Biden were ""shocked and saddened"" by the attack.

""Salman Rushdie — with his insight into humanity, with his unmatched sense for story, with his refusal to be intimidated or silenced — stands for essential, universal ideals,"" the statement read. ""Truth. Courage. Resilience. The ability to share ideas without fear. These are the building blocks of any free and open society.""

BILL MAHER REACTS TO SALMAN RUSHDIE ATTACK: DON'T COME AT ME WITH 'ISLAMOPHOBIC' TO SHUT OFF ISLAM DEBATE

U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a tweet that he was ""appalled"" by the incident and expressed support for Rushdie’s recovery.

""Appalled that Sir Salman Rushdie has been stabbed while exercising a right we should never cease to defend. Right now my thoughts are with his loved ones. We are all hoping he is okay,"" Johnson wrote on Friday.

French President Emmanuel Macron also tweeted his support for Rushdie following the attack.

""[For] 33 years, Salman Rushdie has embodied freedom and the fight against obscurantism. He has just been the victim of a cowardly attack by the forces of hatred and barbarism. His fight is our fight; it is universal. Now more than ever, we stand by his side,"" Macron said.

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese also condemned the attack.

""This senseless violence against a celebrated author is also an assault on global freedom of expression and deserves unequivocal condemnation. May he have a full recovery,"" Albanese added

Rushdie, a native of India who has since lived in Britain and the U.S., is known for his surreal and satirical prose style, beginning with his Booker Prize-winning 1981 novel ""Midnight's Children,"" in which he sharply criticized India's then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.

""The Satanic Verses"" drew death threats after it was published in 1988, with many Muslims regarding as blasphemy a dream sequence based on the life of the Prophet Muhammad, among other objections. Rushdie's book had already been banned and burned in India, Pakistan and elsewhere before Iran's Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a religious decree, or fatwa, calling for Rushdie's death in 1989.

Khomeini died that same year, but the fatwa remains in effect. Iran’s current supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, never issued a fatwa of his own withdrawing the edict, though Iran in recent years hasn’t focused on the writer.

Investigators were working to determine whether the suspect, born a decade after ""The Satanic Verses"" was published, acted alone.

JK ROWLING SHOWS SUPPORT FOR SALMAN RUSHDIE, RECEIVES DEATH THREAT AFTER: ‘YOU’RE NEXT’

District Attorney Schmidt alluded to the fatwa as a potential motive in arguing against bail.

""Even if this court were to set a million dollars bail, we stand a risk that bail could be met,"" Schmidt said.

""His resources don’t matter to me. We understand that the agenda that was carried out yesterday is something that was adopted, and it’s sanctioned by larger groups and organizations well beyond the jurisdictional borders of Chautauqua County,"" the prosecutor said.

Barone, the public defender, said after the hearing that Matar has been communicating openly with him and that he would spend the coming weeks trying to learn about his client, including whether he has psychological or addiction issues.

A state trooper and a county sheriff’s deputy were assigned to Rushdie’s lecture, and police said the trooper made the arrest. But afterward, some longtime visitors to the Chautauqua Institution questioned why there wasn’t tighter security given the threats against Rushdie and a bounty of more than $3 million on his head.

REPORTERS BANNED FROM SALMAN RUSHDIE ATTACKER ARRAIGNMENT

On Saturday, the center said it was boosting security through measures such as requiring photo IDs to purchase gate passes, which previously could be obtained anonymously. Patrons entering the amphitheater where Rushdie was attacked will also be barred from carrying bags of any type.

The changes, along with an increased presence of armed police officers on the bucolic grounds, came as something of a shock to Chautauquans who have long relished the laid-back atmosphere for which the nearly 150-year-old vacation colony is known.

Matar is from Fairview, New Jersey. Rosaria Calabrese, manager of the State of Fitness Boxing Club, a small, tightly knit gym in nearby North Bergen, said Matar joined April 11 and participated in about 27 group sessions for beginners looking to improve their fitness before emailing her several days ago to say he wanted to cancel his membership because ""he wouldn’t be coming back for a while.""

Gym owner Desmond Boyle said he saw ""nothing violent"" about Matar, describing him as polite and quiet, yet someone who always looked ""tremendously sad."" He said Matar resisted attempts by him and others to welcome and engage him.

""He had this look every time he came in. It looked like it was the worst day of his life,"" Boyle said.

Matar was born in the United States to parents who emigrated from Yaroun in southern Lebanon, The Associated Press learned.

Flags of the Iran-backed Shia militant group Hezbollah are visible across the village, along with portraits of leader Hassan Nasrallah, Khamenei, Khomeini and slain Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani.

Iran’s theocratic government and its state-run media assigned no motive for the attack.

News about the stabbing has led to renewed interest in ""The Satanic Verses,"" which topped best seller lists after the fatwa was issued in 1989. As of Saturday night, the novel ranked No. 11 on Amazon.com.

The death threats and bounty Rushdie faced over the book after its publication led him to go into hiding under a British government protection program, which included an around-the-clock armed guard. After nine years of seclusion, Rushdie cautiously resumed more public appearances.

In 2012, he published a memoir about the fatwa titled ""Joseph Anton,"" the pseudonym he used while in hiding.

He said during a New York talk that year that terrorism was really the art of fear: ""The only way you can defeat it is by deciding not to be afraid."""

“China has overreacted and its actions continue to be provocative, de-stabilizing and unprecedented,” Campbell told reporters in a call Friday. He described China’s week-long military drills as an “intensified pressure campaign” against Taiwan, a self-governed island that China claims as a “breakaway province.”

“It has not ended and we expect it to continue to unfold in the coming weeks and months,” Campbell said. He added that several Chinese warships remain near Taiwan.

At the same time, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen insisted earlier in the week China is still flexing its muscles, although some of Beijing’s big military drills seem to be dying down.

4ba04848-a1ee-4d85-8648-ccf9bdae31cd,"Author Salman Rushdie is likely to lose one of his eyes and is currently on a ventilator after he was attacked on stage at a literary event in upstate New York on Friday, a report said.

“The news is not good,” the 75-year-old writer’s agent, Andrew Wylie, told The New York Times.

“Salman will likely lose one eye; the nerves in his arm were severed; and his liver was stabbed and damaged,” said Wylie.

Rushdie, who is still unable to speak, was attacked by a lone man while speaking at an event at the Chautauqua Institution in Chautauqua, NY, about 55 miles south of Buffalo.

He was scheduled to speak about the United States as a place for exiled authors “as a home for freedom of expression,” according to the institute. After the stabbing, he was transported by helicopter to a hospital in Erie, Pennsylvania, where he underwent surgery.

A witness who was in the audience told The Post that Rushdie tried to run off the stage, and the two men scuffled before audience members rushed onstage to subdue the attacker.

Approximately 2,500 people were in the audience at the time.

Rushdie’s alleged attacker, 24-year-old Hadi Matar, of Fairview, New Jersey, was arrested at the scene by a state trooper who was assigned to the lecture.

A State Police spokesman said Matar’s possible motives were under investigation.

But law-enforcement sources told The Post that Matar was sympathetic to the Iranian government, which in 1989 issued a fatwa, or religious edict, under then-their leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini calling for Rushdie’s death over “The Satanic Verses.”

An initial investigation suggested Matar had posted on social media about his support of Iran and its Revolutionary Guard and in favor of Shia extremism more broadly, law-enforcement sources told The Post.

U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sulliving denounced the “appalling” attack in a statement early Saturday morning.

“All of us in the Biden-Harris administration are praying for his speedy recovery,” the statement said. “We are thankful to good citizens and first responders for helping Mr. Rushdie so quickly after the attack and to law enforcement for its swift and effective work, which is ongoing.”

Matar also attacked 73-year-old event moderator Henry Reese. He suffered injuries to his face and was treated and released from a local hospital, cops said.

Like other visitors, Matar had obtained a pass to enter the institution’s 750-acre grounds, President Michael Hill told the Associated Press. His backpack was screened by a sheriff’s deputy and K-9 assigned to the event, according to the Buffalo News.

Kienna Brown, a waitress who works on the grounds of the Chautauqua Institution said the attacker stayed at the Athenaeum Hotel overnight.

“They had to close down employee parking and evacuate to search his room. They weren’t allowing guests in and out [of the hotel],” Brown told The Post.

“A lot of people were traumatized by the events today. It’s very sad,” she said.

Steve Mackey, a server at Heirloom restaurant in Chautauqua said that his coworkers served Matar the night before the attack.

“There was just little interaction. There was shock that they served this guy and the next day he’s on world news,” he said.

Matar’s New Jersey home was swarmed with law enforcement after the stabbing. His attorney, public defender Nathaniel Barone, has declined to comment.

Dr. Martin Haskell, a physician who was among those who rushed to help, described Rushdie’s wounds as “serious but recoverable.”

Witness Kathleen James, said Matar was clad in black clothing and wore a black mask when he rushed the stage.

“We thought perhaps it was part of a stunt to show that there’s still a lot of controversy around this author. But it became evident in a few seconds” that it wasn’t, she told the Associated Press.

Rushdie’s controversial 1988 novel “The Satanic Verses,” prompted Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to issue a fatwa calling for Rushdie’s death over what he claimed were blasphemous references to Islam.

A $3 million bounty was placed on his head for anyone who kills him.

Rushdie, an outspoken proponent for freedom of speech and critic of religious extremism, was born into a Muslim family in Mumbai, India.

He was forced to live in hiding under the protection of the British government from 1989 until 2002. After years of round-the-clock security, he gradually returned to the public sphere.

He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2008, and is widely regarded as one of the UK’s greatest living writers.

“We ask for your prayers for Salman Rushdie and Henry Reese, and patience as we fully focus on coordinating and cooperating with police officials following a tragic incident at the Amphitheater today,” the Chautauqua Institution said in a statement on its website. “All institution programs are canceled for the remainder of the day.”"

New footage has caught Daniil Medvedev confronting a fan at the Montreal Masters after being called a “loser”. The incident happened after his defeat to Nick Kyrgios in the opening round, and security guards can be seen surrounding the world No 1 as he tells his hater that he is “calm” but “doesn’t like” the chants.

Medvedev suffered an early exit at the Canadian open on Thursday, losing to Kyrgios 6-7(1) 6-4 6-2. The 26-year-old was the defending champion and his world No 1 ranking is now in jeopardy following the defeat.

And it now appears that things got even worse for the US Open champion after the match, as a TikTok video has shown the Russian being called a “loser” by a fan at the tournament in Montreal, before he decides to walk up to the man in question and confront him. As Medvedev walks past fans waiting outside the stadium, loud shouts of “loser” can be heard at the start of the video.

The 14-time title winner then turns around and walks in the direction of the shouting, and can be seen confronting the spectator in question as security guards surround the world No 1 and he asks: “What did you say?”. As things continue to heat up, Medvedev can be heard telling him: “I’m super calm.”

Nick Kyrgios has been given the edge for the upcoming US Open despite losing to Hurbert Hurkacz in Montreal. The Pole ended the world No 37’s nine-match winning streak with a 7-6(4) 6-7(5) 6-1 win on Friday but downplayed the significance of the result as he lauded Kyrgios as the “best” player over the likes of Rafael Nadal , who is yet to lose a Grand Slam match this year.

Kyrgios has cemented himself as a contender for the US Open title, though his hopes received a slight blow when he bowed out of the Montreal Masters with a one-sided final set defeat to the world No 10. Prior to the match, the Aussie had been undefeated since reaching the Wimbledon final as he won the doubles title in Atlanta before clinching singles and doubles glory in Washington.

But the 27-year-old’s conqueror still appears to be backing the seven-time title winner ahead of the upcoming US Open, claiming that Kyrgios was the “best” player over the likes of Nadal and Novak Djokovic despite losing their match. “Nick is the best, if not one of the best players in the world right now. I’m proud of this win and I’m ready for what’s next,” Hurkacz said after a three-set battle with the Australian.

It gives the recent Wimbledon finalist a big boost going into the last Grand Slam of the year, with his rivals believing he is the man at the top of the game right now - even over Nadal, who has not lost a match at a Major this season.

Shoppers spotted an Aldi supermarket placing limits of up to five bottles of water per customer in a London branch. Signs around the store said single bottles of water were limited to five items per customer.

The sign, which was temporarily displayed in a store, read: ""Due to high demand at hot weather. Single water bottles limited five items per customer."" ""Limits are necessary for supporting you and your neighbours to find the products you need."" Another sign said the store had limited multipacks of water purchases to three. Supermarkets are able to introduce limits on items in stores at the mangers discretion.

Eight areas of England have declared a drought after a hot and dry summer

It comes eight areas of England have declared a drought after a hot and dry summer. The Environment Agency has moved into drought in eight of its 14 areas, Devon and Cornwall, Solent and South Downs, Kent and south London, Herts and north London, East Anglia, Thames, Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire, and the east Midlands. Documents seen by the Guardian show the Environment Agency expects Yorkshire and the West Midlands will move into drought later in August.

Hosepipe bans have also been implemented by Southern Water and South East Water. Welsh Water will also implement a ban from August 19, and Yorkshire Water from August 26. Thames Water is also “ready to go” with its hosepipe ban, according to its strategy and regulatory affairs director, Cathryn Ross.

The Government stressed essential water supplies for households are not at risk"
ed9098a6-1490-4d4a-868c-91777af06373,"The Environment Agency (EA) has confirmed a drought in Maidenhead, Windsor and Slough as high temperatures and a lack of rainfall continue to turn up the heat on the region.

Senior decision makers from the EA, Government, water companies and other key groups - who together form The National Drought Group (NDG) - met today (Friday) to discuss the response to the driest UK summer in 50 years.

The team discussed the risks and impacts and agreed to further collaborative work to balance water needs and conserve water.

At the meeting, the EA said that the drought trigger threshold had been met to move parts of England - including southern and central parts of the country - into drought. The last drought in England was back in 2018.

It has confirmed drought status in eight of its 14 areas:

Thames

Devon and Cornwall

Solent and South Downs

Kent and South London

Herts and North London

East Anglia

Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire

East Midlands

The triggers used to confirm today’s move to drought status include the hydrological position, including rainfall, river flows, groundwater levels, reservoir levels, and the dryness of soils.

It also takes into account the impacts these conditions have on public water supply and the environment.

Moving to drought status means the EA and water companies will step up their actions to manage the impacts and press ahead with implementing stages of their pre-agreed drought plans.

These plans follow factors including reservoir levels, demand and forecasts, and lead to precautionary actions such as Temporary Use Bans (also known as hosepipe bans).

This week, it emerged that Thames Water would be introducing a hosepipe ban in 'the coming weeks' as the dry weather continues to put pressure on water supplies.

Pictured: The Long Walk in Windsor basking in the heat, with a lack of rainfall drying up the grass.

But South East Water, which also supplies water in Berkshire to areas including Maidenhead, said it wasn't planning to introduce a hosepipe ban in the area 'for the time being'.

Authorities have reassured that 'essential supplies of water are safe' and will 'remain resilient across the country', adding people should use water 'wisely' in drought affected areas.

Prolonged dry weather this year has led to low river flows and reservoir levels falling across much of England.

Meteorologist at the University of Reading, Roger Brugge, said that only 299mm of rain has fallen in Boyn Hill, Maidenhead since the start of November 2021 (the expected fall would be 512 mm).

Harvey Bradshaw, EA executive director for the environment and chair of the NDG, said: ""The current high temperatures we are experiencing have exacerbated pressures on wildlife and our water environment.

""EA staff are doing an excellent job responding to environmental impacts and working with water companies to make sure they are following their drought plans.

""Today’s meeting has helped to build on our coordinated action to manage water supplies, consider water users and protect the environment. We urge everyone to manage the amount of water they are using in this exceptionally dry period.""

Water Minister Steve Double added: ""We are currently experiencing a second heatwave after what was the driest July on record for parts of the country.

""Action is already being taken by the Government and other partners including the EA to manage the impacts.

""All water companies have reassured us that essential supplies are still safe, and we have made it clear it is their duty to maintain those supplies.

""We are better prepared than ever before for periods of dry weather, but we will continue to closely monitor the situation, including impacts on farmers and the environment, and take further action as needed.""

The NDG will continue to work together over the coming weeks, with EA chief executive Sir James Bevan chairing a further meeting of the group with water company chief executives on Tuesday, August 23."

Rafael Nadal has been handed a huge advantage following Daniil Medvedev ’s Montreal Masters defeat to Nick Kyrgios , as the Spaniard now has a chance to play for the world No 1 ranking. Current top-ranked player Medvedev was defending 1,000 ranking points as last year’s champion but will suffer a big drop after losing his opening match , giving Nadal a chance to overtake the Russian.

Nadal has no ranking points to defend until the end of the year, having cut his 2021 season short this time 12 months ago. It gives the Spaniard the opportunity to push for year-end No 1 while his rivals are all chasing last year’s points but he has now been handed the chance to take the top spot as early as August 22 - before the US Open.

Medvedev will be just 125 points ahead of world No 2 Alexander Zverev on Monday with 6,885 in total. But with the German out of Cincinnati as he continues to recover from his freak French Open injury and targeting a return at the US Open, Nadal is the only man who can ascend to world No 1 before the final Major of the year, earning himself the top seed position.

And the current world No 3’s fate lies in the hands of both himself and Medvedev after he announced he had made a last-minute decision to compete in next week’s Cincinnati Masters, less than a week after being forced to withdraw from Montreal when he continued to feel “discomfort” from the abdominal tear he picked up during Wimbledon.

Nick Kyrgios gave a frosty post-match press conference after crashing out of the Canadian Open quarter-finals to Hubert Hurkacz on Saturday. The 27-year-old didn't mince his words by letting reporters know he'd rather be elsewhere than speak to them after his exit.

Kyrgios stopped as he is knocked out of Canadian Open ahead of US Open

Kyrgios' winning form came to an end in Montreal after he lost 7-6 (4) 6-7 (5) 6-1 against the 10th-ranked Pole. He looked fatigued throughout the first two sets and capitulated in the third as Hurkacz booked a semi-final clash with fourth seed Casper Ruud.

The Australian star hasn't earned a reputation for being warm towards the media throughout his controversy-filled career, and there was no love lost after the match. After just his second defeat in 17 matches, Kyrgios was brutally honest about his thoughts on media duties.

He told reporters he 'couldn't care less' about them and admitted he only shows up to avoid adding to his long-running list of fines: ""As for media, I couldn't care less,"" he said. ""I do this because I have to be here, and I don't want to get fined, so… I mean, it's routine. I don't really enjoy it, to be honest. I'd rather not be here right now.""

BRIAN KILMEADE: Garland's admission was not a surprise. After all, this is the man who, spearheading the most wide-ranging investigation in the department's history with the January 6 probe—I don't know if you've noticed — this is the same Merrick Garland who used the Department of Justice and the FBI to target parents as domestic terrorists, which we know they are for exercising their right to free speech at school board meetings, which we televised a lot of it and play it back, even more of it.

...

While Merrick Garland has done nothing to even attempt to reduce skyrocketing violent crime, which is all around us in major cities, he has used his office to declare White supremacy the greatest domestic threat.

DOJ ASKS COURT TO UNSEAL MAR-A-LAGO RAID WARRANT; AG MERRICK GARLAND PERSONALLY SIGNED OFF ON TRUMP SEARCH

So, Merrick Garland is not a man interested in protecting Americans or ensuring equal justice. What we saw today was a man on the defensive (at least I did) a man desperate to save face because, in the words of one senior Justice Department official, the raid was, ""a spectacular backfire."" No joke.

Merrick Garland and the Biden administration, in their arrogance, thought they could raid Donald Trump's home and get away with it quietly simply because he didn't wear windbreakers that said ""FBI"" on them. They underestimated how you, the American people would react to their Soviet-style raids. Americans have lost trust in the FBI, sadly.

Under Merrick Garland, especially, the DOJ is destroying its reputation. In fact, if you are one of millions of Americans who have thought either of those things over the past few days, you have Merrick Garland very upset because he has a different view of himself. He weaponized federal law enforcement and is now mad that you noticed they did just that.

In his statement today, Garland directly responded to anyone who dares question the integrity of an institution that falsified FISA warrants and brought us years of phony Russia collusion investigation, about three and a half years. He called any criticism, ""unfounded attacks."" I'll close the quote and he added that he would ""not stand by silently when their integrity is unfairly attacked."" That includes the FBI.

In other words, how dare you call out this unprecedented abuse of power. You can terrorize Supreme Court justices, which they do, and attack local cops, which happens every hour almost, because the Washington bureaucracy doesn't control them, but you better not besmirch Merrick Garland's FBI agents. There are agents of the uni-party.

6610b41b-bf69-4e0e-a612-ea27ec1ea00f,"CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland called Donald Trump’s bluff on Thursday by announcing that he called for unsealing of the search warrant behind the FBI raid on the former president’s Mar-a-Lago home.

After days with no direct comment, the AG revealed that he personally approved the search warrant and announced that the Department of Justice called to unseal the warrant for the public to see.

Honig joined a panel on ""CNN Newsroom With Alisyn Camerota and Victor Blackwell"" to comment on what he agreed was an ""unprecedented"" act by Garland.

""This is a remarkable and unusual move,"" Honig said. ""We essentially just saw Merrick Garland call Donald Trump’s bluff.""

ATTORNEY GENERAL GARLAND ‘SHEPHERDING’ TRUMP INVESTIGATION IS ‘MADNESS,’ ‘UNPRECEDENTED’: CLAY TRAVIS

While some legal analysts have criticized the lack of transparency surrounding the raid, leftists and media pundits praised the FBI’s actions from the start as ""Christmas"" coming early. However, full details regarding the search warrant beyond speculation have yet to be revealed.

Honig explained, ""In the wake of this search warrant, Donald Trump has two documents, he and his lawyers. One is the search warrant itself with whatever attachments, the other is this inventory or this receipt. Now those documents are going to have important information about the search. These are the documents people have said, ‘Well, if Donald Trump wants to make an issue of this, he should release them.’ What Merrick Garland just said is, ‘We the DOJ are going to release them. We’re going to go to the judge. We’re going to ask the judge to unseal documents,’ meaning making them available to the public because DOJ policy is they will only speak about things that are on the record with the court.""

""So essentially Merrick Garland just said, okay, Donald Trump, you’re not going to release them, we’re going to do it, we’re going to put those documents in front of the American public,"" Honig added.

MERRICK GARLAND TORCHED FOR ADMITTING HE APPROVED THE MAR-A-LAGO RAID: ‘SHUTTER THE FBI. IMMEDIATELY’

Conservatives slammed Garland’s announcement for refusing to provide greater details on the raid and attempting to defend the FBI and DOJ against political accusations. Media outlets have since attacked Republicans for attempting to ""politicize"" the agencies.

We now know more about the search of Mar-a-Lago, and, of course, it has settled absolutely nothing. Reporting on the documents taken from former President Donald Trump’s property — as well as the release of the search warrant by the judge who approved it — has filled in some more outlines of the story, although there is too much we still don’t know.

The quagmire underlines what seems, at the very least, the unbelievable imprudence of the search.

If an FBI action is going to be so inflammatory that the attorney general of the United States can’t maintain a judicious silence about the matter more than a couple of days before publicly jousting with the target, it’s a pretty good indication it shouldn’t have been taken to begin with.

In the immediate aftermath of the Mar-a-Lago search, all the reporting was that Merrick Garland is a by-the-books, circumspect guy who was dead-set on abiding by the department’s policy of not commenting on an active investigation.

Then, lo and behold, on Thursday he was holding a press conference announcing that he was petitioning the judge to release the warrant, and double-dog daring Trump to oppose the unsealing.

How did Merrick Garland get in this situation in the first place? He approved a FBI search that any congressional intern at a happy hour down the street from the DOJ headquarters could have told him was sure to set half the country on fire.

The only way taking the risk — of all the political turmoil, of further eroding trust in our law-enforcement institutions — was worth it was if the stakes were incredibly high; if there was no way to continue negotiating with Trump about the documents; if there was some serious threat to national security in leaving the materials at Mar-a-Lago for another day.

It still seems unlikely that this threshold will be met. We’ve learned that some of the documents taken by the FBI were marked as so-called top-secret/sensitive compartmentalized information, indicating that they should be viewed only in secure government facilities.

The designation, though, doesn’t mean that they were blueprints for hypersonic missiles or lists of classified agents. The government routinely over-classifies, and it wouldn’t have been easy for anyone to waltz out of the White House with the nation’s most sensitive information.

The materials in the president’s daily brief are carried into the White House in a locked bag and carried out in a locked bag. The protocols around the handling of documents included in meetings in the Situation Room are very strict. The agencies that bring secret materials to meetings with the president and White House officials are responsible for bringing them back out.

It must have been a hectic scene when Trump was leaving the White House in January 2021, but that doesn’t mean that the White House ushers and military aides packing up for him would have been able to access, say, a triple-locked safe and box up the nuclear codes for shipment to Palm Beach. If they had tried, someone would have stopped them, or, failing that, immediately called The Washington Post to blow the whistle.

Speaking of the Post, it has reported that the FBI was seeking “classified documents relating to nuclear weapons” at Mar-a-Lago. Sounds serious. And maybe it is. But anyone who lived through the Russia Hoax knows that leakers constantly provided information to journalists carefully couched to sound as ominous as possible and then it was spun up further on social media and cable news.

Sure enough, the Post report had exactly this effect, as purportedly serious people proceeded to compare Trump to the Rosenbergs.

According to The Wall Street Journal account of what the FBI took away, it included much less concerning material, including binders of photos, the grant of clemency for Roger Stone, and something related to President Macron of France. All of this sounds like the kind of stuff a former president who likes having mementos would make off with and consider his own.

Is it possible to believe that Trump was careless in how he handled documents and brought to Florida things he shouldn’t have, while compounding the offense by not being forthcoming negotiations with the National Archives? Sure.

Is it also possible to believe — indeed, consistent with recent experience — that the Department of Justice and FBI worked themselves into tizzy over a relatively minor matters, or let themselves become tools in a political agenda they should have resisted? Absolutely.

The only way to resolve it (if that’s possible) will be completely transparency. If that’s uncomfortable for the Department of Justice, maybe it should have exercised more forbearance and better judgment and not brought the country to this place in the first place."
688f5312-a4d1-4ff3-a1f4-3ad2ca845437,"A former Virginia police officer was sentenced Thursday to more than seven years in prison for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol, tying for the longest sentence served to a participant.

Former police officer Thomas Robertson entered the U.S. Capitol building while wielding a large wooden stick, according to a U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) release about the sentence. He is now tied with militia recruiter Guy Reffitt for receiving the longest sentence served to a participant in the Jan. 6 riots.

Robertson was convicted in April for obstructing Congress during its meeting to certify the 2020 presidential election results, civil disorder, entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds while carrying a dangerous weapon disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building while carrying a dangerous weapon, and tampering with a document or proceedings, the DOJ said.

He owes $2,000 in restitution and will be supervised for three years after his release.

“Thomas Robertson, despite swearing an oath of office when he became a police officer, joined the violent mob at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and did so while armed,” said U.S. Attorney Matthew M. Graves in a statement. “Today’s sentence holds him accountable for his role in the violence that day.” (RELATED: Voters Find Trump Less Responsible For Jan. 6 After Dems’ Prime-Time Hearings)

Reffitt, a recruiter for anti-government Three Percenters militia, was sentenced to seven years in prison in August. He was found guilty in March for obstruction of Congress, interfering with police in a riot, transporting a firearm for that purpose, armed trespassing and witness tampering, The Washington Post reported.

Prosecutors tired to get him imprisoned for 15 years, applying a terrorism sentencing penalty.

Robertson’s co-defendant and fellow former officer Jacob Fracker, who pleaded guilty in March to a federal conspiracy charge, will be sentenced on Aug. 16, the DOJ said.

Over 860 individuals have been arrested for participation in the Capitol riots so far.

Following the driest first seven months of the year since 1976, an official drought has been declared in several areas of England. The announcement means No10 and water companies will put into action their plans to deal with the crisis, with measures set to be felt everywhere from households to the agriculture sector.

Enough water is crucial for farmers' crops, Tom Bradshaw, deputy president of the National Farmers Union, stressed in response to apparent restrictions issued by the Environment Agency (EA). Mr Bradshaw accused the EA of putting the environment above food security, claiming the agency is denying applications from farmers to abstract water under a system that allows them to trade licences. He called on George Eustice, the Environment Secretary, to intervene. Mr Bradshaw said: ""The EA's statutory targets are to protect the environment and they don't in any way have to think about the impact on food production. ""We know environmental protection is incredibly important, but so is producing food that everyone relies on."" He warned food supply could be impacted because imports may also be reduced, as record high energy and fertiliser costs add weight to the challenges brought by the drought.

Concerned farmers warn limited access to water could halve their harvests

Without significant rainfall over the autumn and winter, farmers may simply choose not to plant crops next spring, Mr Bradshaw told the Telegraph. He said: ""Farmers will choose not to grow crops that require irrigation. If they haven’t got that water available and contracts to give them a profitable return, in all likelihood they are not going to take the gamble."" The Tory chairman of the Commons Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee urged the UK to focus on food production. Sir Robert Goodwill, a former minister who is also a farmer, told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme: ""Part of the Government's plan for agriculture outside the European Union is helping farmers become more productive. ""I think we’d have to concentrate a little bit more maybe on food production, and less on things like rewilding and some of the environmental schemes, which albeit … important, we do need to make sure we can feed ourselves and feed the world.""

An official drought has been declared in several areas of England

He added: ""So, I think things like grant aid for farmers putting in reservoirs themselves, so they can pump in winter when there is water, so [they can] then use that for irrigation during the summer."" The environment ministry is expected to lay out further measures to support agriculture in the coming days. A Defra spokesperson said: ""The UK has a high degree of food security built on supply from diverse sources, strong domestic production, as well as imports through stable trade routes. ""However, we recognise our farmers and growers are facing exceptionally dry conditions and through our agriculture monitoring groups, we are working closely with the sector to assess the impacts over the coming weeks. ""We are carefully considering what further steps can be taken to support the agriculture sector and will respond accordingly."" DON'T MISS

Farmers' concerns came as Europe battles what experts warned could be the worst drought for 500 years – with no sign of significant rainfall to come. In the UK, low-water levels and tinder-dry conditions have led the Government to declare an official drought in eight of the 14 areas of England: – Devon and Cornwall

– Solent and South Downs

– Kent and South London

– Hertfordshire and North London

– East Anglia

– Thames

– Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire

– East Midlands Yorkshire and the West Midlands are also expected to move into a drought later in August.

a917ad26-1e97-4c0f-9911-6e217877a940,"EXCLUSIVE: Former White House national security adviser Amb. John Bolton said the assassination plot against him by an Iranian operative, and continued threats from Iran to American citizens on American soil is ""unprecedented"" and ""an act of war,"" telling Fox News the Biden administration has been ""signaling weakness"" to Tehran and should ""terminate"" negotiations on the Iran nuclear deal.

The Justice Department on Wednesday announced charges against Iranian operative Shahram Poursafi, a member of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, for an alleged plot to assassinate Bolton, who served as former President Trump’s national security adviser until 2019.

U.S. officials said the plot was likely planned in retaliation for the January 2020 strike that killed Qassem Soleimani, a revered Iranian leader and the head of Iran’s Quds Force.

In an interview with Fox News Digital on Thursday, Bolton said he had been ""aware"" of plots against him for ""some time.""

IRANIAN OPERATIVE CHARGED IN ALLEGED PLOT TO ASSASSINATE JOHN BOLTON

Bolton said in the spring of 2020, the FBI contacted him with a ""duty to warn.""

""I was given several duties to warn as time went on, and each one was becoming a little more serious,"" Bolton said, noting that he went to a meeting at the FBI in the fall of 2021, where officials explained the latest information they had on plots against him.

Bolton told Fox News he requested U.S. Secret Service protection, which he had during the Trump administration but which was terminated upon his resignation.

The FBI granted the request for USSS protection in December 2021, and Bolton told Fox News that protection is ongoing.

But Bolton said he is not so concerned about the individual plot against him, but rather, threats from Iran against all Americans.

""It is not just me,"" Bolton said. ""The regime in Tehran has targeted a lot of Americans.""

""The aim here is to kill Americans on American soil, and its former government officials,"" Bolton explained. ""This is a broad threat to private American citizens on American soil, and I think it is, essentially, unprecedented.""

He added: ""You could call it an act of war, and it tells you everything you need to know about the government in Tehran.""

The Justice Department, upon charging Poursafi this week, said it ""has the solemn duty to defend our citizens from hostile governments who seek to hurt or kill them.""

Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department’s National Security Division said this ""is not the first time we have uncovered Iranian plots to exact revenge against individuals on U.S. soil, and we will work tirelessly to expose and disrupt every one of these efforts.""

According to the Justice Department, Poursafi approached a U.S. resident he had met online and asked for pictures of the former national security adviser, claiming they would be used for a book he was writing. The resident connected Poursafi to someone willing to take the pictures for $5,000-$10,000.

Poursafi then contacted another person over encrypted messaging applications and offered $250,000 to hire someone to ""eliminate"" Bolton, an amount that was eventually negotiated to $300,000. Poursafi also alluded to another ""job"" in the future, noting that it would pay $1 million.

Poursafi then guided the individual on how to carry out the operation, noting that the use of a small weapon would require the individual to get close to the former Trump administration adviser.

""Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, through the Defendant, tried to hatch a brazen plot: assassinate a former U.S. official on U.S. soil in retaliation for U.S. actions,"" U.S. Attorney Matthew M. Graves for the District of Columbia said this week.

Meanwhile, Bolton went on to slam the Biden administration for engaging in negotiations with Tehran to revive the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, known as the Iran nuclear deal.

""To me, more important than the threats to the individuals is that catastrophic strategic policy that the administration is pursuing to try and revive the 2015 nuclear deal,"" Bolton said. ""You’ve got a government that absolutely won't honor any commitments it makes—it will do whatever it thinks is necessary to get nuclear weapons.""

He added: ""People are deluding themselves if they think that if we give Iran enough concessions, that they gain to let us back into the nuclear deal—they'll do what they want to do.""

IN DESPERATE EFFORT TO SALVAGE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, WILL US CAVE TO EU APPEASEMENT?

President Trump’s administration withdrew from the accord in 2018.

Bolton told Fox News he thinks the threat Iran poses to the United States has been ""intensifying for some time,"" but said it is at ""its highest level now.""

Iran’s regime has boasted over the last few weeks that it can develop a nuclear weapon , and even it went as far to threaten to obliterate New York with an atomic bomb, turning the metropolis into ""hellish ruins.""

""The Biden administration has been signaling weakness,"" Bolton said, noting that officials have said that they consider talks on the nuclear deal ""separate from terrorism.

""Well, that may be fine for the White House, but in Tehran, they don’t have those compartments,"" he continued. ""And Iran sees this jumble of inconsistent policies that we’re pursuing and, that, too, is a sign of weakness.""

President Biden’s negotiators in Vienna, Austria, have not sought to restrict Iran’s production of its long-range missile program.

The Iran nuclear deal contains no provisions to stop Tehran’s sponsorship of terrorism across the globe.

IRAN DECLARES IT CAN USE NUCLEAR MISSILES TO TURN 'NEW YORK INTO HELLISH RUINS'

Bolton told Fox News that he would ""terminate the negotiations"" in light of the threats against him and American citizens.

""I don't think the deal as written would stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons, I don't think the passage of time has made it any better, I don't think the concessions the Biden administration has made have strengthened the deal—I think they've weakened the deal,"" Bolton said.

Bolton said Iran uses ""negotiations as camouflage and as a weapon.""

Bolton went on to tell Fox News that adversaries of the United States took the Biden Administration’s withdrawal from Afghanistan last year ""as a signal of retreat.""

""I thought it was a terrible mistake to withdraw, I mean, the manner in which the withdrawal was conducted was also embarrassing and dangerous, but the decision was a mistake,"" Bolton said, adding that ""the past year has demonstrated the United States gave up an incredibly important strategic position in Central Asia.""

""They just abandoned it for nothing and it has increased the terrorist threat emanating from Afghanistan,"" Bolton told Fox News. ""It has boosted Russia and China’s strategic circumstances in Central Asia; it has reflected the Taliban ignoring one commitment after another.""

""We ought to learn the terrorists, whether they are terrorist states or terrorist groups, don’t honor their commitments,"" Bolton continued. ""The Taliban didn’t do it. The Iranians don’t do it.""

Bolton told Fox News that the withdrawal was seen by Beijing and Moscow ""as a sign of American retreat and isolationism and they have acted accordingly.""

""Very detrimentally to our interest,"" Bolton said."
e2fafb33-4bf0-439c-82d9-43175bd46cb4,"Wednesday’s revelation that an Iranian operative had been charged with trying to arrange the assassination of former National Security Adviser John Bolton was “long overdue” — and suggests the Biden administration was staying silent about Tehran’s nefarious activities to keep alive ongoing talks about re-entering the 2015 nuclear deal, former US officials tell The Post.

The Justice Department unsealed the indictment against Shahram Poursafi two days after negotiators in Vienna settled on a “final text” of an agreement, with all parties now consulting in their capitals on whether to consent to it.

“The negotiations are pretty much complete at this point,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters at the White House Aug. 4, later adding: “We’re not going to wait forever for Iran to take this deal — the deal on the table. They ought to take it.”

The Poursafi indictment traces his attempts to set up a hit on Bolton on behalf of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps from October of last year through April of this year and says the operation was “likely” in retaliation for the US killing of IRGC commander Qassem Soleimani in January 2020.

But longtime Iran watchers have dismissed that timeline and said the threat against Bolton and other US officials was prevalent as soon as Soleimani was wiped out in a US drone strike at Baghdad’s international airport.

“It’s been going on since 2020,” said Gabriel Noronha, a fellow with the Jewish Institute for National Security of America and former special adviser to the State Department’s Iran Action Group.

“This is just sort of the first official unveiling of an indictment, which is sort of long overdue.”

In March, the Washington Examiner reported, citing a DOJ official, that “at least two Iranians belonging to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards’ covert-action Quds Force” were plotting to rub Bolton out, but other Biden officials were resisting announcing an indictment “for fear that it could delay their drive for a nuclear deal.”

Simone Leeden, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East, told The Post that the administration “clearly could have acted sooner” to unseal the indictment of Poursafi, who is unlikely to ever stand trial.

“If they had this level of information for such a long time and didn’t indict for ‘diplomatic reasons,’ you know why? They’re protecting the [Iranian] regime,” Leeden said. “I mean, there’s no other way of looking at it. Instead of protecting John Bolton, they’re protecting the regime. So yeah, I mean, it’s hard to understand, it’s hard to come up with any other reason why they would have delayed this much.”

The assassination arranged by Poursafi was likely a retaliation by Iran for a US airstrike that killed a prominent Iranian general. AP

“I don’t blame the DOJ,” said Noronha, who added that the department has done “the Lord’s work” and been “the most aggressive” executive agency against the Iranian government. “I blame NSC and State, who are trying to meddle in this … [and] trying to temper DOJ’s sort of public comments and prosecution.”

A former national security official also noted that the timing of the Poursafi indictment “leads one to wonder whether the administration was keeping this assassination plot quiet, so as not to complicate their efforts to entice Iran back into a nuclear deal.”

“The assertion that [DOJ] held a public indictment out of concerns it would impact the JCPOA negotiations is categorically false,” a White House spokesperson told The Post. “As the Department of Justice said in March, ‘In every case, the Department’s decision whether to charge would be made based on the facts and law and in accordance with the principles of federal prosecution.'”

The Justice Department did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.

Nathan Sales, the State Department’s counterterrorism coordinator during the Trump administration, also raised an issue with the language used in Wednesday’s indictment.

“The Iranian official hasn’t been charged with providing material support to a terrorist organization, which seems like an obvious charge to bring,” Sales said, “particularly considering that a material support charge carries a more severe sentence than the murder for hire charges that they’ve actually leveled against him.”

Deepening the confusion, the FBI’s wanted poster for Poursafi says he is being sought for “providing and attempting to provide material support to terrorists,” though the DOJ announcement of his indictment doesn’t mention the words “terrorist” or “terrorism.”

“We have said this before and we will say it again: the Biden Administration will not waiver in protecting and defending all Americans against threats of violence and terrorism,” current National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said in a Wednesday statement. “Should Iran attack any of our citizens, to include those who continue to serve the United States or those who formerly served, Iran will face severe consequences.”

“I’m glad Jake Sullivan is saying what he’s saying. But that is not going to stop the Iranians from trying to shed American blood,” Sales said in response. “You’re going to have to take a much tougher line to show the regime that targeting Americans on American soil is going to result in a ferocious response that would far outweigh any benefit the Iranians hope to achieve by committing an act of terrorism here at home.”

Leeden agreed, calling the DOJ’s statement, “in some ways more political.”

Meanwhile, the experts say Iran still poses a threat to US officials, with Noronha telling The Post the danger has “steadily increased” over the past 18 months.

According to the former State Department official, any investigation of Tehran’s dark deeds should also focus on “Iranian government operatives” based out of the country’s United Nations mission in New York and the Iranian Interest Section in Washington.

“It’s fairly well know they do shady stuff there,” Noronha said.

US officials like Bolton or former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, whom Poursafi reportedly said he would pay $1 million to have killed, aren’t the only ones to be targeted by Tehran.

On July 31, a man with an assault rifle was arrested outside of the Brooklyn home of dissident journalist Masih Alinejad — who has previously been targeted by alleged Iranian operatives.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation released a wanted poster for Shahram Poursafi on Aug. 10, 2022 for his plot to murder Bolton. AP

“I think there are [a] substantial number of people who are vulnerable to these Iranian efforts,” Bolton himself told CNN Wednesday, later adding: “I think the nature of the regime drives it to this kind of action. And I think it’s a big mistake for the administration to continue to show weakness to Iran by begging to get back into the 2015 nuclear deal. I think it encourages Tehran to engage in just these kinds of terrorist activities.”

“The Iranian regime has continually provoked us and we have effectively said there is no provocation too great that is going to result in us walking away from the table,” Sales said. “That’s bad policy, but it’s also bad diplomacy because it gives the Iranians the upper hand. It makes us look weak. And any deal that comes out of that kind of imbalanced arrangement is going to be dreadful for American national security.”

A White House spokesperson defend the administration’s desire to revive the nuclear deal on Wednesday, saying: “President Biden has been clear that he will ensure Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon. He believes diplomacy is the best path to achieving that goal. As long as he believes pursuing JCPOA talks is in US national security interests, we will continue to do so.”"

In the wake of a shocking speech from the Chinese ambassador to Australia, in which Xiao Qian said China would stop at nothing to take back Taiwan, Dutton said the Chinese Communist party had been “very clear” about their intentions. Liberal leader and former defence minister Mr Dutton said that “nobody should be surprised” if there is a military conflict between China and Taiwan.

China regards Taiwan as a breakaway province that must be reunited with the mainland, using force if necessary.

In an address to the National Press Club, Xiao said there would be “no compromise” on its one China policy. China, which is continuing its threatening military behaviour in the region after US house speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, wanted a “peaceful reunification”, he said.

He said: “But we cannot, we can never rule out the option to use other means, so when necessary, when compelled, we are ready to use all necessary means.

“As to what does it mean, ‘all necessary means’? You can use your imagination, but … we will never allow Taiwan to be separated from China.”"

Nick Kyrgios is the only player on the ATP Tour ""who can compare"" to Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal in their prime, according to Andy Roddick, but the American still feels this year's Wimbledon finalist will ""explode"" at any moment. Kyrgios is arguably the most in-form player on the ATP Tour and he proved that with an excellent win over world No 1 Daniil Medvedev on Wednesday evening.

Kyrgios reached a Grand Slam final for the first time in his career at Wimbledon and returned to action last week to win both the singles and doubles titles at the Citi Open. With little time to rest and recover, Kyrgios is back in action at the Montreal Masters where his first-round win over Sebastian Baez set up a fascinating clash with Medvedev.

The Russian tennis star has also been in excellent form since returning to the tour after being banned from playing at Wimbledon. And the world No 1 took the opening set against Kyrgios on Wednesday evening, but the Aussie forced a third set where he soon took control.

Kyrgios went on to win what was his 14th match from his last 15 on and just the second time in his career he's beaten a player ranked No 1 in the world. He now faces Alex de Minaur in the next round where a win will make him a seeded player for the US Open later this month.

Kyrgios is enjoying a red-hot summer - reaching two semi-finals on the grass before making his maiden Grand Slam final at Wimbledon. After losing to Djokovic, he has won every match since, lifting the doubles title in Atlanta two weeks ago before winning both singles and doubles in Washington.

And he is now through to the third-round of the Montreal Masters after downing top seed Medvedev in three sets on Wednesday, adding to his impressive 2022 CV. Following his second career win over a world No 1, the 27-year-old made a bold claim about his current level as he put himself above every other player on the tour, including the likes of Djokovic and Nadal.

The world No 37 was asked where he felt his level was over the last few months and what ranking he thinks would accurately reflect his current form, and the Aussie answered: “One or two,” according to Arash Madani.

BONDI: Having personally as a prosecutor for 18 years signed thousands of subpoenas - thousands - many times people don't comply. So what do you do? You either issue a new subpoena or you do a motion to compel. Why wasn't that done in this case? The Trump people were working well with them. Why wasn't that done? That's a question for Merrick Garland. Number two for Merrick Garland: the warrant. Think about the warrant. If you're going to issue a warrant, the reason has to be, ""I'm worried they're going to destroy evidence."" What's suspect about that? We've now learned that warrant was signed on Friday, but not executed until Monday. So why get the warrant? That doesn't even make sense.

b95ef071-8e55-4203-a5a1-9ced1e68915e,"Former U.S. Attorney Joyce Vance blamed former President Donald Trump for the ""appalling,"" great ""crime"" of Americans losing confidence in federal law enforcement Thursday.

Vance appeared on MSNBC's ""Hallie Jackson Reports"" to discuss Attorney General Merrick Garland's remarks on the FBI raid of Trump's Mar-a-Lago home. Various Republicans, including Trump, have called out the federal agency as ""authoritarian"" for what appeared to some to be a political attack against the former president.

Vance blasted these accusations as well as Trump's several grievances with federal agencies, insisting that career public servants like herself and FBI agents are ""loyal to the Constitution and [] work on behalf of the American people.""

She lamented the ""crime"" of Trump sowing distrust in government ""without having any basis for doing it.""

REPUBLICAN RESPONSE TO FBI RAID ON MAR-A-LAGO ‘DISTURBING AND DANGEROUS,’ CLAIMS WASHINGTON POST

""Our justice system like so much of our government can only be effective as long as Americans have confidence. And in perhaps one of the greatest, I’ll use the word crimes, although maybe not technically a crime that Donald Trump committed, was compromising the confidence that Americans have in federal law enforcement, in prosecutors, in agents, in the intelligence services, and doing that without having any basis for doing it. It’s appalling. It compromises the functioning of government,"" Vance argued.

Several federal agencies have been caught in scandals surrounding attempts to implicate the former president. In 2020, it was revealed that the Justice Department mishandled a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant to spy on former Trump aide Carter Page. The Senate Intelligence Committee also found that the FBI based part of its years-long investigation into Russian collusion based on the unverified Steele dossier.

Vance further praised Garland for filing a motion to unseal the search warrant and property receipt from the FBI raid after admitting that he personally approved of the search warrant in the first place. Vance continued to hold Garland as an example against Trump’s behavior.

""Merrick Garland is working as hard as he can to demonstrate through his actions that the public can trust the work that he is doing, that the career employees of the Justice Department are doing. Donald Trump is working as hard as he can to protect himself at the expense of some of the public servants of the FBI who are some of the finest people that I’ve ever worked with, and we have the unfortunate specter of elected Republican leadership who will not expose what the former president is doing and call it out for the travesty that it is. It is in many ways incumbent upon them to come forward,"" Vance said.

4660583d-ea19-4c3f-82f0-4ca092f009f1,"Bassam al-Sheikh Hussein, an armed man who took hostages, leaves the branch of a Federal bank in Beirut, Lebanon, 11 August 2022. According to initial reports, an armed man stormed a Hamra-based bank and is keeping employees and clients as hostages demanding to be given his deposits. EPA-EFE/WAEL HAMZEH

BEIRUT, Lebanon - Bystanders hailed as a hero an armed customer who held bank staff hostage for hours Thursday in Lebanon because he couldn't access funds frozen after the country's economic collapse.

The suspect, identified only as Bassam, was armed with a rifle and had doused the interior of the bank with gasoline, security sources said.

But after eight hours the standoff ended peacefully.

""Bassam you are a hero!"" cheering bystanders chanted outside the bank.

The incident was the latest involving local banks and angry depositors unable to access savings that have been locked in Lebanese banks since the country's economic crisis began in 2019.

Official media said the suspect turned himself in when the bank agreed to give him $30,000 out of his more than $200,000 in trapped savings.

""Employees taken hostage have also begun to leave the bank,"" Lebanon's National News Agency (NNA) said.

An AFP correspondent at the scene saw hostages and the suspect being escorted away in police cars from the Federal Bank branch where the drama unfolded, near west Beirut's commercial centre of Hamra Street.

Protesters at the scene had chanted ""down with the rule of the banks"", while others took to social media to express their support for the shaggy-bearded suspect wearing shorts and flip-flops.

Police could not immediately say whether the man would face charges.

Local residents said the incident began at about 10:30 am (0730 GMT).

The man had ""a pump-action rifle and flammable material, and threatened employees to give him his savings,"" a security source told AFP, requesting anonymity.

Another security source said a man in his 40s ""poured gasoline all over the bank, and closed the bank's front door, holding employees hostage"".

He demanded savings worth more than $200,000, the source said.

The man ""threatened to set himself on fire and to kill everyone in the branch, pointing his weapon in the bank manager's face"", NNA said.

He said he stormed the bank because his father ""was admitted to hospital some time ago for an operation and could not pay for it"", NNA reported.

His brother Atef al-Cheikh Hussein told journalists: ""My brother has $210,000 in the bank and wants to get just $5,500 to pay hospital bills.""

He said his brother had grabbed the weapon ""from the bank and did not bring it with him"".

A cigarette, a rifle

A video circulating on social media in the morning showed two people negotiating with the armed man behind the bank's metal door.

He replied angrily, wielding the rifle in one hand and a cigarette in the other.

The suspect later released two hostages, AFP correspondents at the scene said.

Lebanon has been mired in an economic crisis for more than two years, since the market value of the local currency began to plummet and banks started to enforce draconian restrictions on foreign and local currency withdrawals.

Lenders have also prevented transfers of money abroad.

""Similar incidents keep happening. We need a radical solution,"" George al-Hajj, who heads Lebanon's bank employees' union, told AFP outside the bank.

""Depositors want their money, and unfortunately their anger explodes in the face of bank employees because they cannot reach the management.""

The local currency has lost more than 90 percent of its value since the onset of the crisis.

Inflation is rampant, electricity is scarce and, according to the United Nations, around 80 percent of Lebanese live in poverty.

Many Lebanese blame the country's political elite, wealthy and aged figures entrenched for decades. They cite corruption and also blame the banking sector for the country's economic collapse.

International donors say aid to the bankrupt country is conditional on reforms, which politicians have so far resisted.

""A depositor is not taking people hostage. It's bank owners and their friends in the ruling militias who are taking an entire people hostage,"" economist Jad Chaaban said on his Facebook page.

9c83e2e8-b3d0-428d-b48d-a6eae44dbc80,"Hollywood co-stars and pals shared heartfelt words this week about the actress Anne Heche, calling her a “great artist” and mother — as her loved ones prepare to take her off life support following her car wreck last week in Los Angeles.

The 53-year-old “suffered a severe anoxic brain injury” and is “not expected to survive” after her car plowed into a Los Angeles home and went up in flames last Friday, her rep said.

As the news of her poor recovery continues to go from bad to worse, Heche’s “13 Minutes” co-star Peter Facinelli and other colleagues paid tribute to the Emmy Award winner.

“Praying for you and your beautiful family,” the actor, 48, wrote on his Instagram story alongside a behind-the-scenes photo of the two of them.

Heche’s ex-boyfriend James Tupper offered his “thoughts and “prayers” for Heche in a statement to the Daily Mail.

Tupper, who dated the actress from 2007 until 2018, referred to Heche as “one of the true talents of her generation.”

He also shared a snap of Heche with their 13-year-old son, Atlas.

“Thoughts and prayers for this lovely woman, actress and mother tonight Anne Heche we love you,” he wrote.

Heche’s most famous ex, Ellen DeGeneres, sent her well-wishes to the actress earlier this week.

“I don’t want anyone to be hurt,” the comedian, 64, told photographers on Monday, according to the Daily Mail.

“Fringe” and “Oz” star Kirk Acevedo also sent his love to Heche’s family, tweeting, “My heart goes out to Anne Heche’s children. No child should lose their mother at such a young age.”

Meanwhile, the creator of the “Final Destination” franchise, Jeffrey Reddick, wrote, “This is so tragic. I’m seeing many nasty comments.

“To those people, just understand that people you know struggling with addiction are listening. You’re telling them they can never talk to you about their struggles or turn to you for help.”

Actress Rosanna Arquette expressed sorrow about Heche’s current condition on Twitter.

“I’m very upset and sad that Anne Heche is not expected to live,” she tweeted. “And yes she would have been arrested for driving under the influence and putting lives in danger.”

“She still is a great artist and struggled with addiction it’s terribly sad for her children and for her friends,” she added.

Actress Joely Fisher replied to the tweet with a photo of her and Arquette with Heche, writing, “Let’s remember her like this.”

Earlier this week, scandal-scarred actor Alec Baldwin paid tribute to “brave” and “wonderful” Heche.

“Everybody join me please in sending their support and love to the wonderful Anne Heche,” Baldwin told his 2.4 million followers in an Instagram video on Saturday afternoon.

“I love you Anne — I love you. And I think you’re such a talented person and I hope everything is OK,” he said of the star, who was filmed racing through quiet LA streets before the inferno.

“I’m sorry that you had this tragic thing happen to you and I’m sending you all my love, OK?” he said of his troubled co-star."

Smith, who won The Open last month, has been heavily rumored to be defecting from the PGA Tour to LIV Golf, with fellow Australian golfer Cameron Percy saying a move was imminent. The Telegraph reported on Tuesday that Smith will join with the Saudi-backed tour for $100 million, with an announcement following the ongoing FedEx Cup.

Asked earlier in the week about a move, Smith demurred, saying he wants to focus on the FedEx Cup. And when asked by Sky Sports about reporters reading between the lines of those comments, Smith said he’s OK with taking heat for it.

“It’s just their job, mate, that’s what they’re there to do,” Smith said. “They’re there to sell stories. I’m sure they’ve had a few looks at it the last few days.

“I’m ready to cop some heat. I understand that’s what I said, but like I said I’m here to win the FedEx Cup playoffs that’s my No. 1 goal and whatever happens after that will come from me.”

Smith bristled at questions about a departure after his win at St. Andrews last month, but it seems to be only a matter of time before he officially joins the group of defectors that has set the golf world alight.

Things have escalated further this week, with the PGA winning a legal victory over three players it suspended from the FedEx Cup for playing with LIV, and Greg Norman’s renegade tour needing to shut down the notion that its players only receive prize money if the amount is greater than their guaranteed pay."

But Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta never got physical while filming the movie musical, and instead went on to share a 44-year friendship that remained strictly platonic.

In her 2018 autobiography “Don’t Stop Believin,’ “ Newton-John — who died Monday following a long battle with cancer — revealed the reason she never hooked up with her hunky co-star, despite their “undeniable attraction” toward one another.

“Yes, we really liked each other and there was an attraction, but we would never date because we were both involved with other people at the time,” the bubbly blond divulged in the tome.

“Both of us have a loyalty streak that runs deep,” she added, insisting she would never cheat on a partner.

The pair steamed up screens in “Grease,” and their chemistry crossed over into real life — but they never acted on their flirtations. Redferns

Still, the pair enjoyed a strong flirtation, with Newton-John going on to recall her amorous audition alongside Travolta.

“John came out to meet me. Our eyes met. When we walked inside the room together, it was magic, and everyone saw it,” she cooed. “They couldn’t deny this kind of chemistry.”

Their fondness for one another only intensified over the course of the two-month shoot, with the Australian beauty becoming enamored by her co-star’s kindness.

Newton-John divulged that Travolta purposely messed up a scene so that they could shoot it again because he believed that she could “do better.”

“He said: ‘Sorry I messed up. Liv, I did that on purpose because I don’t want them to use that take. I know you can do better,’ ” she recalled in the memoir. “I had great love and support from him and the feeling was mutual. I would be forever grateful for his concern.”

Newton-John also wrote about filming the final scene of “Grease,” where her character, Sandy, shows off her sexy makeover in leather pants and a tight tank top.

“There were gasps, catcalls and a lot of whistling,” she penned, before detailing Travolta’s reaction to her eye-catching ensemble.

“John was filming the song ‘Sandy’ and I strutted on set. He stopped singing mid-note, as his head jerked up and his eyes popped. ‘Tell me more, tell me more,’ he shouted. We laughed so hard. It was exactly the reaction I wanted,” Newton-John wistfully wrote.

Meanwhile, the superstar claimed that Travolta told her on set: “Liv, it’s every guy’s dream to have you as his girlfriend.”

In her book, Newton-John wrote that Travolta later told her: “It almost happened between us a few times, but it didn’t. Sometimes life just offers you the wrong timing. We had to leave it as dear friends.”

Indeed, the pair enjoyed a friendship for the ages, frequently appearing together on red carpets and reuniting for “Grease” anniversaries.

In 2018, Travolta told People magazine that the huge success of their flick had helped them stay connected.

“When you share that kind of meteoric success — and nothing has been able to exceed it— you share a bond,” he stated. “I’ve been through her having a child, getting divorced, losing her sister. She’s been through my getting married, having children. It’s wonderful and full of shared memories.”

Following Newton-John’s death, Travolta was the first A-lister to pay tribute to his beloved pal.

“My dearest Olivia,” he emotionally wrote on Instagram. “You made all of our lives so much better. Your impact was incredible. I love you so much.

“We will see you down the road and we will all be together again. Yours from the first moment I saw you and forever! Your Danny, your John.”"

Estimated read time: 4-5 minutes

ATLANTA — Tonight's sturgeon supermoon could have you dancing in the moonlight — the type that only happens three to four times per year.

Named by the Native American Algonquin tribe after sturgeon fish that were more easily caught in the Great Lakes and other bodies of water during this time of year, the sturgeon moon ends 2022's series of four supermoons, which began in May, according to The Old Farmer's Almanac. After sunset, look toward the southeast to watch this supermoon rise. It will reach peak illumination on Thursday night.

""At certain times of the year, the moon is at its closest point to Earth and these are called supermoons,"" said Mike Hankey, operations manager for the American Meteor Society, via email. ""It's just a natural point of the moon's orbit. At each extreme, the moon is either a little bigger or a little bit smaller (at its furthest point), but it is not a huge difference.""

This nearest proximity is called the perigee, and it is only about 226,000 miles from Earth, according to NASA. That's why a supermoon also appears slightly brighter than a regular full moon. The moon's distance from Earth changes throughout the month since its orbit isn't a perfect circle, according to The Old Farmer's Almanac.

If you take a cool photo of the supermoon, you could share it on social media with the hashtag #NASAMoonSnap — the phrase NASA is using to track moon-inspired content leading up to the late-summer launch of Artemis I, the first test flight of the rocket and spacecraft that will send future astronauts to the moon, according to NASA's Tumblr. The agency has shared a guide for photographing the moon, and will share some users' content on its social media platforms during the launch broadcast.

The sturgeon moon will steal the spotlight of the Perseid meteor shower peaking Thursday through Saturday.

""Bright moon phases are bad for meteor showers as they wash out the dimmer meteors,"" Hankey said. ""A full or almost full moon dominates one part of the sky, making that part undesirable for observing meteors. The full moon also lasts the entire night, leaving no hours of complete darkness, which is preferred.""

The Perseid meteor shower lasts from July 14 to Sept. 1, and this year's barely visible peak will happen at 9 p.m. MDT on Friday, according to EarthSky. In previous years, the Perseids have been a highly anticipated shower in the Northern Hemisphere, where it's usually more visible. But that's only when the moon isn't in a phase dominating the sky.

This year, the Perseids — which strengthen in number from late evening to early dawn — were more visible in early August when the moon appeared smaller and dimmer. In previous years, they were most visible in nearly moon-free skies.

The shower's fragments come from comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle, which takes 133 years to orbit the sun just once, according to NASA. The comet last entered the inner solar system in 1992.

Remaining space events in 2022

Four more full moons will occur this year, according to The Old Farmer's Almanac:

Sept. 10: Harvest moon

Oc. 9: Hunter's moon

Nov. 8: Beaver moon

Dec. 7: Cold moon

Other Native American tribes have different names for the full moons, such as the Cheyenne tribe's ""drying grass moon"" for the one happening in September, and the Arapaho tribe's ""popping trees"" for the full moon occurring in December.

Catch the peak of these upcoming meteor shower events later this year, according to EarthSky's 2022 meteor shower guide:

Draconids: Oct. 8-9

Orionids: Oct. 20-21

South Taurids: Nov. 5

North Taurids: Nov. 12

Leonids: Nov. 17-18

Geminids: Dec. 13-14

Ursids: Dec. 22-23

And there will be one more total lunar eclipse and a partial solar eclipse in 2022, according to The Old Farmer's Almanac. The partial solar eclipse on Oct. 25 will be visible to people in Greenland, Iceland, Europe, Northeast Africa, the Middle East, West Asia, India and western China.

The total lunar eclipse on Nov. 8 can be seen in Asia, Australia, the Pacific, South America and North America between 1:01 a.m. MT and 6:58 a.m. MT. But for people in Eastern North America, the moon will be setting during that time.

Wear proper eclipse glasses to safely view solar eclipses, as the sun's light can damage the eye.

Nick Kyrgios has shown that he’s ready to back up his Wimbledon final and push on for a maiden Grand Slam title at the US Open after beating Daniil Medvedev in Montreal . The Aussie came from a set down to upset the top seed and defending champion, marking just his second career win over a world No 1 after upsetting Rafael Nadal as a teenage wildcard, and he has now shown the Spaniard he is ready to fight in Flushing Meadows.

Kyrgios extended his match-winning streak on Wednesday after defeating Medvedev in a blockbuster showdown, recovering from a code violation and first-set loss to come through 6-7(2) 6-4 6-2 in just under two hours, sending last year’s champion packing. As well as winning his eighth successive match, he also notched his second win over a world No 1.

It comes eight years after the first, when he stunned Nadal in the Wimbledon fourth-round as a 19-year-old wildcard making his debut at the All England Club, ranked down at world No 144. The 27-year-old appears to be in the best form of his life, and has shown the Spaniard that he is a huge contender for the US Open title following his second No 1 scalp.

Nadal is unbeaten at Grand Slam level this year, winning the Australian Open and French Open before reaching the Wimbledon semi-finals, where he was forced to pull out on the eve of his semi-final with an abdominal tear. The world No 4 had coincidentally been sent to face Kyrgios in the last-four clash, but their meeting never came to be as the Aussie received a walkover into the final.

US Open favourites Daniil Medvedev, Novak Djokovic and Rafa Nadal have all been warned about in-form Nick Kyrgios ahead of the tournament. Kyrgios is enjoying some of the best form of his career and recently won both singles and doubles titles at the Citi Open.

Kyrgios defeated Noshihito Nishioka in Sunday’s singles final, and teamed up with Jack Sock to win in the doubles draw. It came after the Australian reached the final of Wimbledon, albeit benefitting from Nadal’s withdrawal ahead of their semi-final before losing to Djokovic at the last hurdle. But former World No 1 Kim Clijsters believes the best players in the world should be fearful of Kyrgios due to his form during the hardcourt season. The four-times Grand Slam champion says she cannot wait to see the 27-year-old at the US Open, which starts later this month.

Kyrgios believes he has been one of the best players in the world this season and has put his hard work down to a successful training block ahead of the Australian Open in January. He was excellent at Wimbledon but came unstuck against the exceptional Djokovic. ""I think it's a reflection of the last six months of how hard I have been working. I'm just really happy to continue the form after Wimbledon,” Kyrgios, who has previously struggled for consistency and motivation, said after the Citi Open. “I think you have got a small window after a Grand Slam that people kind of fear you before they step out on the court. I feel like I made the most of it this week. I'm really happy with my performance."" DON'T MISS...

Fresh off a win at the British Open, Smith’s absence on the PGA Tour would largely be considered one of the most notable ones — aside from being the highest-ranked player to join LIV, he is one of the more up-and-coming players on the PGA Tour.

Granda was working at the ritzy Fontainebleau hotel in 2012 when Becki allegedly locked eyes with him as she sat by the pool in a bikini before she began flirting with him.

Granda, who had no clue who she or her husband were at the time, claimed he was shocked when she asked him if he wanted to come back to her room with her after he got off work.

“When I didn’t say no right away, she added, ‘There’s just one thing … My husband wants to watch,’” Granda wrote in an excerpt of the new book, co-written by Mark Ebner, provided to Rolling Stone.

“I was conflicted. On the one hand, she was in her bikini, touching her neck, fussing with her hair, paying me compliments, sipping on her drink while she stared into my eyes. I found it all very intriguing,” Granda, now 31, revealed. “But it was also weird and unlike anything I had ever done before.”

He asked Becki if just the two of them could meet alone at first, but she said it would go against an agreement she’d made with her husband. He told her he’d think about it and let her know.

“Soon after, her husband came down and joined us, and she introduced him as Jerry. He wore Speedo briefs, with his belly hanging over his waistband,” Granda said in the book. “It was a little awkward, and he largely avoided eye contact, but he shook my hand and said, ‘Nice to meet you, Gian,’ with his thick Southern accent. He pronounced Gian like ‘John,’ and this became his nickname for me for as long as I knew him.”

With some encouragement from his co-workers, he agreed to meet the Falwells at a Day’s Inn. He even phoned his sister to tell her what was happening “in case Becki and Jerry turned out to be serial killers. She thought the whole thing was hysterical.”

Granda met Becki in the hotel lobby, where she appeared nervous and was drinking whiskey out of a plastic cup, according to the excerpt. The two made awkward small talk before heading upstairs, he claimed.

“At the time I had the impression they had never done this before, but a decade later I think that’s highly unlikely,” Granda said.

In the room, Jerry, allegedly was drunk and lying down on one of the two queen-size beds, Granda recalled. “Hey Gian,” Falwell said to the pool boy, letting out a giggle.

Granda, nervous, allegedly told Jerry that if he was feeling jealous at any point, to say something and he would stop — “But he told me, ‘Don’t worry about it. You guys do what you want to do.’”

Becki and Jerry had one rule as part of their arrangement: No sexual intercourse.

The affair between Giancarlo Granda and Becki Falwell is described in Granda’s upcoming book “Off the Deep End: Jerry and Becki Falwell and the Collapse of an Evangelical Dynasty.”

Instead, Granda and Becki performed oral sex on each other while Jerry stared, and, at one point, got too close for comfort, the book claims.

“At some point, Jerry got up and walked to the side of the bed to get a better angle. I had a moment of near panic, thinking, What is he doing? and I told him to back off — not in a hostile way, just establishing some boundaries. He apologized and quickly walked back toward the entrance and stood right outside the bathroom.”

Granda said that afterward, he was sure that the encounter was a one-time thing — until he got a phone call from Becki the following day asking if he wanted to see her again.

“I paused, then thought, Why not?” Granda wrote.

The two continued the relationship until 2018.

The widely publicized affair is also the subject of an upcoming Hulu series, “God Forbid: The Sex Scandal That Brought Down a Dynasty,” which premieres on Nov. 1."

Falwell Jr.'s fall from grace began in 2020 after Giancarlo Granda, a younger Falwell family business partner, said he had a yearslong sexual relationship with Becki and that Jerry would participate as a voyeur, scandalizing the private evangelical Christian college community that Falwell Jr. once served.

""They have a public image, but behind the scenes, they're freaks,"" Granda, who worked as a pool attendant for the Fontainebleau Hotel on Miami Beach in 2012, says in a trailer for the new Hulu documentary, ""God Forbid: The Sex Scandal That Brought Down a Dynasty.""

The former hotel employee adds that he didn't know who the Falwells were, and had he known what his affair with Becki would turn into, he would have rejected her advances.

He was ""afraid for a long time and was constantly reminded by the Falwells of how they would come after"" him if he spoke up about what happened, Granda said at the time. He added that they lived a lavish lifestyle of ""heavy drinking and going to nightclubs, which is strictly prohibited by the honor code that they expect everyone else to follow"" at Liberty.
