9be4b004-15b3-4ec2-b991-49e67c2f00f5,"Under a deal signed with FTX in July, BlockFi was to receive a $US400 million revolving credit facility while FTX got an option to buy it for up to $US240 million.

BlockFi’s bankruptcy filing also comes after two of its largest competitors, Celsius Network and Voyager Digital, filed for bankruptcy in July citing extreme market conditions that had resulted in losses at both companies.

Crypto lenders, the de facto banks of the crypto world, boomed during the pandemic, attracting retail customers with double-digit rates in return for their cryptocurrency deposits. On the flip side, institutional investors such as hedge funds looking to make leveraged bets paid higher rates to borrow the funds from the lenders, who profited from the difference.

SEC listed as creditor

Crypto lenders are not required to hold capital or liquidity buffers like traditional lenders and some found themselves exposed when a shortage of collateral forced them, and their customers, to shoulder large losses.

BlockFi’s largest creditor is Ankura Trust, a company that represents creditors in stressed situations, and is owed $US729 million. Valar Ventures, a Peter Thiel-linked venture capital fund, owns 19 per cent of BlockFi equity shares.

BlockFi also listed the US Securities and Exchange Commission as one of its largest creditors, with a $US30 million claim. In February, a subsidiary of BlockFi agreed to pay $US100 million to the SEC and 32 states to settle charges in connection with a retail crypto lending product the company offered to nearly 600,000 investors.

In a blog post, BlockFi said its Chapter 11 cases would enable the company to stabilise its business and maximise value for all stakeholders.

“Acting in the best interest of our clients is our top priority and continues to guide our path forward,” BlockFi said.

BlockFi had earlier halted withdrawals from its platform and acknowledged it had “significant exposure” to FTX and its associated entities, including “obligations owed to us by Alameda, assets held at FTX.com, and undrawn amounts from our credit line with FTX.US.”

In its bankruptcy filing, BlockFi said it had hired Kirkland & Ellis and Haynes & Boone as bankruptcy counsel and Berkeley Research Group as a financial adviser.

At the end of June, a third of BlockFi’s $US1.8 billion outstanding loans were unsecured, according to the company.

BlockFi was founded in 2017 by Prince, who is currently the company’s chief executive officer, and Flori Marquez. BlockFi also has offices in Jersey City, New York, Singapore, Poland and Argentina, according to its website.

In July, Mr Prince had tweeted that “it’s time to stop putting BlockFi in the same bucket / sentence as Voyager and Celsius.”

“Two months ago we looked the ‘same.’ They shut down and have impending losses for their clients,” he said.

According to a profile of BlockFi published earlier this year by Inc, Mr Prince was raised in San Antonio, Texas, and financed his college education at the University of Oklahoma and Texas State University with winnings from online poker tournaments. Before starting BlockFi with Ms Marquez, he held jobs at Orchard Platform, a broker-dealer, and at Zibby, a lease-to-own lender now called Katapult.

Ms Marquez previously worked at Bond Street, a small business lending outfit that was folded in to Goldman Sachs in 2017, according to Inc.

Mr Bankman-Fried had styled himself as a saviour for failing crypto ventures in June and had provided emergency financing for BlockFi that gave him an option to buy the lender at a fire-sale price.

But on Monday, BlockFi said its exposure to Mr Bankman-Fried was ultimately its downfall, noting that his Alameda Research trading firm had defaulted on $US680 million ($1 billion) of collateralised loans in early November.

BlockFi’s complaint claims that around the same time, on November 9, it and Emergent entered into an agreement to guarantee the payment obligations of an unnamed borrower by pledging certain “common stock” as security. Legal correspondence included in the case identify the borrower as Alameda.

The dispute is a sign of the intense pressure on Mr Bankman-Fried, whose paper fortune vanished almost overnight with the collapse of his $US32 billion FTX empire. Authorities in the US and the Bahamas, where FTX was headquartered, have launched investigations.

In the days leading up to FTX’s bankruptcy filing on November 11, Mr Bankman-Fried had been rushing to raise billions of dollars in fresh financing. Spreadsheets he shared with investors listed his Robinhood shares as an asset.

Earlier in November, the FT reported that Mr Bankman-Fried had been privately attempting to sell the Robinhood shares using the secure messaging app Signal in the days leading up to FTX’s bankruptcy filing on November 11.

Mr Bankman-Fried had continued to negotiate selling his Robinhood shares even after entering into the pledge agreement, according to two people familiar with the matter.

According to messages seen by the FT, Mr Bankman-Fried was still negotiating those sales on the evening of November 10.

BlockFi also named ED & F Man Capital Markets in the lawsuit as Emergent’s broker, claiming the London-based brokerage had “refused to transfer the Collateral to BlockFi”.

Legal correspondence filed along with the complaint shows that ED & F Man had declined to transfer the assets “absent an order from the Bankruptcy Court” in the FTX proceedings in Delaware.

BlockFi and Mr Bankman-Fried did not immediately return requests for comment. ED & F Man declined to comment beyond the correspondence included in the filings.

a556ed5a-5c29-4a84-9692-a57c5a5be832,"BlockFi Inc filed for bankruptcy, the latest crypto firm to collapse in the wake of crypto exchange FTX’s rapid downfall.

BlockFi said in a statement that it will use the Chapter 11 process to “focus on recovering all obligations owed to BlockFi by its counterparties, including FTX and associated corporate entities,” adding that recoveries are likely to be delayed by FTX’s own bankruptcy. Chapter 11 bankruptcy allows a company to continue operating while working out a plan to repay creditors.

It made waves in 2019 when it began providing interest-bearing accounts with returns paid in Bitcoin and Ether, with its program attracting millions of dollars in deposits right away. Credit:Bloomberg

The petition, filed in New Jersey, lists BlockFi’s assets and liabilities at between $US1 billion ($1.5 billion) and $US10 billion each. The company said in the statement that it had around $US257 million of cash on hand, and is starting an “internal plan to considerably reduce expenses, including labor costs.”

Citing “a lack of clarity” over the status of bankrupt FTX and Alameda Research, the New Jersey-based company earlier halted withdrawals and said it was exploring “all options” with outside advisers."
21f03cdc-8de0-4d57-b048-c880c9e28eec,"This past year has been hectic for the crypto lending platform BlockFi, and today is no different as the company shared an announcement that it filed for voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey.

On November 10 the crypto platform shared in a tweet that it paused activity, including withdraws, and stated on Monday that “activity continues to be paused at this time.”

The bankruptcy was commenced to “stabilize its business and provide the company with the opportunity to consummate a comprehensive restructuring transaction” for all its clients and other stakeholders.

BlockFi says it has $256.9 million in cash, which will be used to provide “sufficient liquidity to support certain operations during the restructuring process.” However, BlockFi owes a list of creditors unsecured claims up to $729 million, court documents show. One of BlockFi's creditors was FTX, which has its second largest unsecured claim at $275 million.

The company said it will focus on recovering all obligations owed to BlockFi and counterparties like FTX.

In July, FTX signed a deal with the option to buy BlockFi for up to $240 million, the CEO of BlockFi Zac Prince tweeted. Since then, things have tumbled as FTX collapsed and also filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, weeks before BlockFi. With that said, “the company expects that recoveries from FTX will be delayed.”

The company stated that it has a consolidated amount of over 100,000 creditors across a massive range of $1 billion to $10 billion in liabilities and assets, according to a court filing.

This news follows a number of crypto-focused companies, like Voyager and Celsius, which are also currently going through bankruptcy proceedings.

In March 2021, BlockFi closed a $350 million Series D funding round, valuing the company at $3 billion at the time. Bain Capital Ventures, partners of DST Global, Pomp Investments and Tiger Global co-led the round with participation from a number of other firms.

Earlier this year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged BlockFi for failing to register its retail crypto lending product and violating the registration provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940, according to a press release in February.

To settle the charges, BlockFi agreed to pay a $50 million penalty to the SEC and an additional $50 million in fines to 32 U.S. states to settle similar charges. According to a filing on Monday, BlockFi owes the SEC $30 million."

Crypto lender BlockFi was once eager to hand practically anybody a sack of money containing gold-plated crypto coins, without even a bare credit check. Now they themselves would like some investor to lay out some cash without asking too many questions, especially not about their obvious connections and contagion from the fallout of FTX.

On Monday, the New Jersey-based company announced it was declaring Chapter 11 bankruptcy, otherwise known as reorganizational bankruptcy, to “protect clients and the company,” according to Mark Renzi, a director at BlockFi’s financial advisor Berkeley Research Group.

The company’s bankruptcy forms indicate they have between $US1 ($1.5) and $US10 ($15) billion in assets and between $US1 ($1.5) and $US10 ($15) billion in liabilities. Of the claims on BlockFi, Ankura Trust Company — which offers lines of credit to stressed companies — is owed over $US729 ($1,096) million. Ankura was acting as trustee for the site’s interest-bearing crypto accounts, according to the documents. Meanwhile FTX US, listed under its larger umbrella company West Realm Shires, has a $US275 ($413) million claim.

Another $US30 ($45) million is owed to the Securities and Exchange Commission after signing an agreement to pay the agency $US100 ($150) million. The SEC has hounded companies like BlockFi for listing multiple crypto tokens, which the agency says are securities, without registering them with the SEC. The names of dozens of other BlockFi clients who have claims on millions from the crypto lender were not disclosed in the documents.

Earlier this year, during the start of what’s been a very long, cold, dry crypto winter, BlockFi cut 70% of its staff and was struggling financially, but along came Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of crypto exchange FTX, who offered the crypto lender a $US250 ($375) million revolving credit line. At the time, BlockFi founder Zac Prince said “our team is battle tested and has weathered many storms over the years, which only makes us stronger and more resilient as we navigate today’s market environment.”

That support from FTX has come back to bite BlockFi in the most sensitive part of their posterior. Earlier this month, the crypto exchange collapsed in spectacular fashion, showing that Bankman-Fried, who often goes by SBF, was funelling users’ money from the exchange to his separate crypto lending firm Alameda Research. Though his own company has declared bankruptcy, SBF is still living outside the U.S. in the Bahamas, despite federal law enforcement, securities agencies, and elected officials looking to ask the man a few questions about how he handled user funds.

In that time, BlockFi was facing serious financial issues thanks to this dependence on SBF’s generosity. Company execs previously claimed they did not “have significant exposure to FTX” or Alameda, though the company started limiting and finally suspended withdrawals on the platform earlier this month.

Though earlier reports mentioned that the company was anticipating layoffs, BlockFi said it will continue paying its employees and will work to retain them throughout the drawn-out bankruptcy process (though the company had previously claimed it wasn’t facing fallout from FTX, so it’s used to lying in customer facing statements). Decrypt reported, based on an anonymous, internal source, that the company does plan further layoffs.

The company further claimed it has $US256.9 ($386) million cash on hand to provide “sufficient liquidity” for “certain operations.”

The only people making out on any of this crypto loss are the attorneys. Notably, one of the same firms conducting BlockFi’s bankruptcy, the New York-based firm Kirkland & Ellis, are also handling beleaguered exchanges Celsius’ and Voyager’s bankruptcy proceedings. There is further fear that big exchanges like Coinbase, whose stock was recently downgraded by Bank of America, could suffer the same fate as BlockFi and many other crypto companies this year. Meanwhile, the price of the world’s most popular cryptocurrency bitcoin has slid further down due to the ongoing turmoil among lenders and exchanges."

""Given the lack of clarity on the status of FTX.com, FTX US and Alameda, we are not able to operate business as usual,"" the company said in an FAQ. Withdrawals remain paused.

""BlockFi’s chapter 11 cases will enable BlockFi to stabilize its business and provide BlockFi with the opportunity to consummate a reorganization that maximizes value for all stakeholders,"" BlockFi said. ""The court-supervised restructuring process is transparent and encourages dialogue between all stakeholders.""

As with many other players in the industry, BlockFi faced an uncertain future after several crypto companies crumbled in the spring, taking the prices of many cryptocurrencies down with them. Soon after, FTX agreed to prop up BlockFi with a $400 million credit line. The agreement also gave FTX the option to buy BlockFi for up to $240 million. As The New York Times notes, that meant the companies had close financial ties and FTX's collapse into bankruptcy has had a knock-on effect on BlockFi.

“With the collapse of FTX, the BlockFi management team and board of directors immediately took action to protect clients and the company,” Mark Renzi of Berkeley Research Group, BlockFi's financial advisor, said in a statement. “From inception, BlockFi has worked to positively shape the cryptocurrency industry and advance the sector. BlockFi looks forward to a transparent process that achieves the best outcome for all clients and other stakeholders.”

BlockFi says that, as part of its restructuring, it will ""focus on recovering all obligations owed to BlockFi by its counterparties, including FTX and associated corporate entities."" However, it noted that recoveries from FTX are likely to be delayed, given that company's bankruptcy process. In addition, BlockFi says it has $256.9 million in cash on hand, which should provide “sufficient liquidity to support certain operations during the restructuring process,"" such as paying employee wages and continuing benefits.

In a court filing, BlockFi estimated it had more than 100,000 creditors and consolidated liabilities of between $1 billion and $10 billion. Among the listed creditors are FTX (to which it owes $275 million in loan repayments) and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which it owes $30 million.

Earlier this year, BlockFi agreed to pay $100 million to settle charges from the SEC and 32 states. The SEC claimed that BlockFi offered interest accounts without registering them under the Securities Act. The agency also found that the company made ""false and misleading"" claims related to the level of risk in its lending activity and loan portfolio.

Filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection doesn't inherently mean a company is done for. The process allows a struggling business to keep trading while it restructures and looks for ways to pay back creditors. However, bankruptcy isn't easy to come back from, and BlockFi is just the latest in a long line of dominoes to fall in the precarious crypto industry."

""His passing is a tragedy and our thoughts and prayers are with his family,"" they wrote in the statement. ""He is survived by his wife and their beloved son. We kindly request that you respect their privacy during this difficult time.""

PEOPLE reached out to Amber Group for comment on Monday afternoon.

According to Yahoo News, Amber Group received a $3 billion valuation in 2022 and was seeking another $100 million in funds.

Kullander spokes to Forbes in 2020 about operating the company during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The biggest disruption is not being able to visit clients,"" Kullander said. ""That's the beauty with crypto. You can access these markets 24/7.""

""If anything, we have seen business pick up, perhaps because everyone is just sitting around at home,"" he added.

In their statement, Amber Group called Kullander a ""pillar of our success"" who led by example with ""his intellect, generosity, humility, diligence and creativity.""

Tiantian Kullander, the co-founder of Hong Kong-based digital asset company Amber Group, died at the age of 30 on 23 November.

The unexpected death of the young crypto founder - confirmed by the company in a statement on Sunday night - has left many in the financial markets sector shocked.

The statement revealed that Kullander, a former Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs trader affectionately known as “TT”, “unexpectedly” died in his sleep. It did not share any other details.

“It is with the deepest sadness and a heavy heart that we inform you of the passing of our friend and co-founder, Tiantian Kullander, who passed away unexpectedly in his sleep on November 23, 2022,” it read.

The statement described him as “instrumental to the founding of Amber and a pillar of our success”.

“He put his heart and soul into the company, in every stage of its growth. He led by example with his intellect, generosity, humility, diligence and creativity,” it said.

“TT was a respected thought leader and widely recognised as a pioneer for the industry. His depth of knowledge, his willingness to collaborate and his desire to always help others benefited countless start-ups and individuals,” it added.

Kullander’s company, Amber, was recently valued at $3bn after scoring a $200m funding round. He set up the company in 2017 with a group of finance insiders, including former Goldman Sachs Group and Morgan Stanley workers.

News reports said Amber Group was in a bid to raise a further $100m earlier this month.

The firm has over 300 employees in Hong Kong, Taipei, Seoul and Vancouver. In 2017, Amber Group’s founders had initially sought to apply machine learning to quantitative trading, but pivoted to crypto in 2019 when the trading volumes for the virtual currency increased.

Kullander had made it to the Forbes 30 Under 30 list while working as a trader.

“We lost a great partner and a true friend in TT and words cannot express our sorrow at this time,” said the Amber Group statement.

“TT’s legacy will live on and we will work even harder to make Amber the category-defining leader of our industry, as this was TT’s ambition and dream.

Kullander, described as “a devoted husband, a loving father and a fierce friend”, is survived by his wife and son.

bde4048d-cb80-4b22-b96f-72346cb33667,"(Bloomberg) -- Oil rose as OPEC+ delegates said deeper production cuts could be an option when they meet this weekend.

Most Read from Bloomberg

West Texas Intermediate rose 1.3% to settle above $77 a barrel. Earlier in the session, oil prices slumped below $74 to the lowest since December as protests over harsh anti-Covid measures erupted across China triggered a broad selloff in commodities and equity markets. With the oil market’s structure looking increasingly weak, delegates from the group say additional reductions could be an option.

The nearest portion of the Brent and WTI futures curves flipped into contango -- a bearish structure indicating oversupply -- with physical markets also under pressure. Speculators markedly reduced bullish bets, posting the sixth-largest reduction in net-long positions on record for Brent last week. Underscoring the market’s shaky fundamentals, JPMorgan Chase & Co. reduced its Brent crude forecast by $8 to $90 as it expects Russian production to hit prewar levels by mid-2023.

OPEC+ will meet Sunday to decide on its next output level, while European Union nations debate whether to set a price cap as low as $62 a barrel on exports of Russian crude oil. Several countries demanded a level that could put more pressure on Moscow, but the talks remain stuck, diplomats said.

Over the weekend, the US moved to grant supermajor Chevron Corp. a license to resume oil production in Venezuela after sanctions halted all drilling activities almost three years ago. The sanctions relief comes after Norwegian mediators announced the restart of political talks between President Nicolas Maduro and the opposition. Yet Chevron’s CEO Mike Wirth said it might take years to begin to refurbish those oil fields, meaning additional output won’t be immediate.

Fund manager Perpetual says it has stopped the sale and distribution of two funds the competition watchdog says might be too risky for retail investors.

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission on Friday issued an interim stop order on Perpetual preventing it from offering or distributing the funds to retail investors for three weeks.

The funds in question are the Perpetual Pure Microcap Fund, which invests in Australian companies with a market capitalisation of less than $300 million, and the Perpetual Geared Australian Share Fund, which employs leverage. It is able to take on debts of up to 60 per cent of the fund's total assets, a strategy that magnifies both risks and returns.

""ASIC made the interim orders to protect retail investors from potentially investing in funds that may not be suitable for their financial objectives, situation or needs,"" the regulator said.

The targets for both funds include investors interested in preserving their capital, those who intend to use the products as core components of their investment portfolio and those who need to withdraw their money on a weekly and daily basis, ASIC noted.

""Perpetual takes its regulatory obligations seriously and has taken immediate steps to comply with this interim stop order,"" Perpetual said in a statement.

Perpetual said it ceased the sale and distribution of those products, effective on Thursday, ""until further notice"".

Nov 25 (Reuters) - Australian securities regulator on Friday directed a unit of asset manager Perpetual Ltd (PPT.AX) to stop offering or distributing two funds to retail investors on an interim basis due to significant market risks involved.

The announcement comes at a time when Perpetual is looking to seal a deal with buyers EQT-owned Barings Private Equity Asia (BPEA) and Regal Partners (RPL.AX) while being cornered by a court to pursue its own takeover proposal for rival Pendal Group (PDL.AX).

The Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC) said the Perpetual Pure Microcap Fund and Perpetual Geared Australian Share Fund, offered by Perpetual Investment Management, have been asked to stop issuing interest or giving advice to retail investors for 21 days.

The funds' portfolio are exposed to high market volatility and carry significant risks, increasing chances of large losses for investors, the regulator said.

03797412-0bb1-43f9-9c18-0d8dbc720393,"It’s late in the year, which means the holiday sales period has well and truly begun. If you haven’t already seen your spending go up, the possibility is looming.

And you probably have some concerns about spending your money wisely.

WATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE:

For more Personal Finance related news and videos check out Personal Finance >>

Furthermore, shopping can be a harrowing experience, and our attitudes towards money are tied up in all kinds of feelings.

Based on psychology, here are three tips to improve the way you spend your hard-earned cash this holiday season.

Before the purchase – patience is your friend

One of the amazing features of the human mind is that we can mentally time travel: we can imagine what the future is going to feel like. Scientists call this “affective forecasting”.

Thinking about a future trip – imagining the warm sun, the sand between your toes, finding yourself smiling – is an example of such mental time travel.

However, it turns out we’re not very good at affective forecasting. We get wrong not only the emotions we will experience, but also their intensity and duration. Lottery winners are a classic example – contrary to expectations, many are not happy, or not happy for long.

More importantly, you can derive happiness from just anticipating future experiences. For example, one study measured the happiness of 974 people going on a trip compared with 556 people not going on a trip. As you might expect, the vacationers were relatively happier – but only before the trip.

So, how can we take advantage of our capacity to mentally time travel?

Tip #1: Pay now, consume later. These days, fuelled by the rise of “buy now, pay later” options, we get to consume what we want immediately. However, this instant gratification deprives us of a key source of happiness: anticipation. A better strategy is to commit to buy something and then wait a little before actually consuming it.

At the point of purchase – notice you’re paying

An inevitability of every purchase is spending money. This represents a cost, both in terms of the monetary value but also the opportunity to buy other things.

Costs are a form of loss, and we don’t like losing things. For that reason, it psychologically hurts to spend money. Scientists call this the “pain of paying”.

According to one theory of shopping, we decide to buy after making a mental calculation: is the anticipated pleasure of consuming higher than the anticipated pain of buying?

This calculus is even represented in the brain. For example, one study looking at people’s brains with fMRI while they purchased food found neural activity in areas linked to higher-order, affective pain processing, which correlated with how high the price was.

How did you pay for your last meal? Did you have to dig into your wallet or purse trying to extract the appropriate combination of notes and coins? Maybe you simply pulled out a plastic card and swiped it on the reader? Or perhaps you absentmindedly touched your smartphone to the machine.

It turns out your method of payment changes how much pain you feel. In one study, researchers asked some university employees if they would like to buy a mug at a discounted price. Half were only allowed to pay in cash, whereas the other half had to use a debit or credit card.

Those who paid in cash self-reported more pain of paying. So, how can you use this to your advantage?

Tip #2: Ramp up the pain. If you’re worried about overspending this holiday period, ramp up the pain of paying. You can do this by using cash or receiving a notification each time money leaves your account.

After the purchase – stop chasing rainbows

A fundamental feature of human beings is that we are adaptive – we easily get used to the new normal. This applies to our purchases, too. Scientists call it “hedonic adaptation”: over time, consumption of the same thing brings decreasing happiness.

Remember the day you got your smartphone? You may have felt joy as you caressed the smooth aluminium back and watched light glint off the unblemished glass. Now look at your phone. What happened to the joy?

It’s normal to experience hedonic adaptation. However, one problem is that we don’t anticipate it.

Remember affective forecasting? Since satisfaction is a function of expectations relative to performance, when we fail to adjust our expectations in light of the inevitable hedonic adaptation, we end up dissatisfied.

The second problem with hedonic adaptation is that the obvious solution appears to be buying something new. Maybe you need a new smartphone to replace your slightly scratched-up old one? If this is your thinking, you’ve just hopped onto the hedonic treadmill.

Now the only way to maintain your happiness is to spend more and more money to get better and better versions of everything. So, how can you get off this treadmill?

Tip #3: Buy experiences, not things. It turns out people end up happier when they buy experiences rather than things. For example, a study that tracked how older adults spent their money found that only one category of spending was related to happiness: leisure purchases, such as going on trips, seeing a movie at the cinema, and cheering at sporting events.

One reason for this is that we adapt to purchases of experiences more slowly than purchases of material things.

So, the next time you’re tossing up between buying tickets to a festival or getting the latest gadget, pick up your scratched-up smartphone and pre-purchase some festival tickets for you and your friends.

Black Friday is upon us once again, and with the cost of living crisis still burning hot, it’s more critical than ever that we approach the sales with caution.

As an emotional spender at large myself, I’ve rounded up four emotional spending traps to avoid, to help you stay financially safe this Black Friday and Cyber Monday.

1. Scarcity bias spending

The hype of Black Friday is no accident – and us emotional spenders just can’t stand missing out. It activates our natural scarcity bias, and makes us want to pounce before it’s too late.

This can often mean our good intentions are squashed by just taking a little peek online to see what’s cracking on your favourite sites.

Also by Emma Edwards:

How to sidestep the trap: If you think you’ll be tempted, use a Chrome extension called SiteBlocker to limit your access to your go-to sites during the sale period.

If you trust yourself to browse without your credit card deets tumbling into the checkout page, try preparing a list of approved items with a set price that you’re allowed to buy at if they’re discounted to that level. If it’s not on the list, it’s not going in your cart.

2. Momentum spending

Big sale periods stimulate a behavioural phenomenon called momentum spending. We’re far more likely to buy a second item once we’ve already bought something, because that first purchase sets off a desire to keep the momentum going.

I know this all too well, and it comes up even more so when I try to stop myself from spending at all. One sabotage purchase and I’m an out of control card-tapping monster.

How to sidestep the trap: Momentum spending starts with that first purchase, so we have two options.

Either don’t start the process at all (e.g. don’t shop the sales), or take extra steps to redirect your attention and your energy after a purchase. Shut the laptop. Leave the mall. Go and get busy with something else to redirect your focus away from spending.

3. Discount dopamine spending

Spending money gives us a surge of dopamine – the feel good brain chemical. But you know what else floods us with the stuff? Discounts.

Getting a big discount on a great product, whether we want that product or not, makes us giddy. If we see a $500 dress down to $79, we’re more excited about the $421 savings than the actual item itself.

How to sidestep the trap: Shopping the sales only from a wishlist can help with this temptation. You could also set a rule to avoid looking at the percentage discount and focusing solely on what you’ll be handing over.

Remember, 75 per cent off might be a great deal, but it’s 100 per cent off if you don’t buy it at all.

4. Regret avoidance spending

We wacky humans actually make a lot of our decisions based on the avoidance of regret. We really don’t like regretting stuff, and this comes up a lot during tempting sales. I’m a repeat offender of using the phrase “I’ll just get it and decide later”.

We do this in an attempt to take control of that fear or regret, but the collateral damage is our bank accounts. We promise ourselves we’ll return it if we decide we can’t afford it, but all too often wind up keeping it anyway.

How to sidestep the trap: Get familiar with your fear of regret. Noticing it can help you break the cycle of giving into it.

Then, up the stakes on your money. We can train our brains to focus on the regret of spending the money over the regret of missing the deal by assigning a greater emotional value to the money in our bank account.

It can help to visualise what your money is for, or put it in buckets with assigned categories. It’s much harder to part with your travel fund than it is to pull money out of an anonymous saver.

The December season of goodwill often turns into a January hangover of financial regret. As credit card debt soars , households should be ever-more determined to avoid overspending at the holidays. Armed with insights from behavioral economics, you can escape the giving season with a solid balance sheet.

The only way to beat the marketers is to see through their gimmicks: the bonus, the urgency, and the ease of purchase. Seeing those techniques for what they are can help shoppers avoid promotional sales like Black Friday ; make fewer online purchases; and put off buying things for themselves. Instead, create mutual accountability by enlisting family and friends to limit gift arms races.

Don’t be drawn into deep discounts. The structure of the sales are highly choreographed events by marketers who know how to exploit the brain’s reward systems. By dangling a reward — the “huge” savings between the actual price and the sale price — and creating urgency with a time limit, marketers encourage impulse buys.

Avoid retail therapy. Over half of holiday shoppers admit to also buying gifts for themselves. Yes, while you are looking for Charlie’s present you might find something for yourself. I get it. Combine the ease of online shopping , a glass of wine, and the stress of the season and sellers have consumers right where they want them. Add to cart. The problem is that by shopping sales and getting drawn into promotions, you may be buying more than you expected. Instead, make note of what you want, but wait. Big-ticket items are usually also discounted in January and February — and the passage of time will help you discern quality and compare prices.

Retail therapy is especially tempting when you’re feeling down, and lots of people feel down during the forced jollity of the holiday season. Advertisers know it. To beat the system, make a game of noting all the ads promising buyers that spending will somehow reward the shopper and boost their mood.

A little friendly peer pressure can also help you refrain from overspending. Every holiday season, I have the same conversation with friends and family: How can we limit the gifts and the circle of gift givers? Without an agreement, the spending escalates as the presents get more expensive, more numerous, and the people greater in number. It becomes a Yuletide arms race. Almost everyone I know wishes the circle was smaller and the gifts were cheaper. And almost everyone doesn’t want to be the first to impose it.

A successful arms agreement is fun; considers community; and people don’t break it. For example, you might draw names and buy one gift for one person; to make it work, agree on a spending limit for the one gift.

I know all too well how hard limiting gifts can be. One year, my sister-in-law told us that only the children could receive presents and the adults would instead do a “white elephant” game. The game was hilarious — we each wrapped a secret gift and then engaged in a round of steals and trades. But over the years, it escalated — first to little stocking stuffers; then to debating if a 25-year-old was still a kid; and then the white elephants became seriously expensive presents. We realized it was time to draw up a new “arms agreement.”

Lots of people enjoy the holidays because looking for and finding the perfect gift for someone you love is joyous. If you can resist impulse buys by avoiding the frenzy of promotional sales and retail therapy, and manage the expectations of your friends and family, you can enjoy feeling generous while also making sure your household makes it to 2023 happier and more solvent.

406a2699-d993-4577-a526-9d45d40615d5,"The first step is some much needed self-reflection. Start by shopping your wardrobe: Take a look at everything you own, divide it into categories (for example, workwear, loungewear, formal wear etc.). This will help you figure out what you have, what’s missing, and let you ask yourself some crucial questions: What in front of you do you like? What don’t you like? How much of it do you actually wear? How much of it is newer? Older? What fits and doesn’t? If you typically wear loungewear, why do you have so many dresses? Performing this 'wardrobe ethnography' will help you dive deeper into and understand your clothing. “When you do all of this work and introspection and really start thinking about what clothing constitutes the best, happiest version of yourself, then you’ll go into the sales having a clear vision,” Forbes-Bell says. This methodology can be applied to other areas of your life throughout the year."
423c5464-f4e6-4ea8-a443-5aa0ed4a649b,"Black Friday, Singles Day, Cyber Monday, Boxing Day – the sales are upon us, and although they always tease and tempt, the stakes feel higher this year, as a cost-of-living crunch forces people to keep the lights off and use Afterpay to buy groceries.

While an opportunity to save on staples, treats and Christmas gifts, sales also encourage overspending, buying things we wouldn’t otherwise and bringing forward purchases we may have made in the future but don’t need – and may not be able to afford – now.

“Sales are one of the most common reasons people acquire possessions,” says Dr Melissa Norberg, an associate professor in psychology at Macquarie University with expertise in hoarding, panic buying and identifying online shopping problems.

“Buying things on sale is not an inherently bad idea, especially when money is tight,” she says, but doing so unnecessarily can cause financial strain – “the very thing that people are trying to avoid by buying sale items”.

Reflecting on the root of sales-induced temptation is important – is it a desire for the thing itself, the rush from buying the thing, or a fear of missing out? All of these feelings can be strong and hard to resist.

“We’ve often had years of practice giving in to these emotions,” Norberg says. “Feel them, buy. Feel them, buy.

“We unfortunately just don’t give ourselves a chance to learn that we can live with slight discomfort, and without the product.”

‘Consumers should be vigilant during sales periods,’ says the ACCC. Photograph: Ellen Smith/The Guardian

Tolerating discomfort teaches us that emotions “do not need to dictate our behaviour”, and proves that intense shopping desires usually dissipate quickly.

Accordingly, her “biggest advice is to just stop and think”.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) echoes that advice, noting that sales seasons are rife with predatory pricing tactics.

Consumers should ... compare prices across retailers ACCC

The watchdog instituted federal court proceedings against Dell Australia on 4 November, alleging they made “false or misleading representations regarding the price of monitors … and the potential savings when a monitor was purchased with a computer”. Dell stated that the issue occurred due to an error in their pricing process, and that they were updating their systems to prevent the error from occurring again.

Across the pond, Strand – formerly Strandbags – was just fined almost A$710,000 (NZ$765,000) in Auckland’s district court for advertising products as “significantly discounted or being sold at special prices” when they were not.

Under Australian consumer law, it is illegal for businesses to make false or misleading representations in their advertising, including “about discounts or availability of products”.

“The ACCC is aware of concerns that some retailers increase prices for a short period immediately prior to sales periods in order to justify their discount claims during the sales,” an ACCC spokesperson tells Guardian Australia.

“Consumers should be vigilant during sales periods. They should undertake research and compare prices across retailers.”

Some, like YouTuber Hannah Louise Poston, are in favour of skipping sales altogether, and imposing a “no-buy” or “low-buy” rule if sales time feels irresistible. Poston, who launched her YouTube channel in 2018 to document a year-long no-buy, suggests paying full price can help ensure you really want something, and that you buy it when you actually need it, which can save you more in the long run.

‘If the fear of missing out drives you to buy things you don’t use, then it’s best to walk away.’ Photograph: Xinhua/Rex/Shutterstock

She applies the same rationale to buying back-ups of items such as skincare or detergent, arguing they often languish unused, leading to clutter and waste. Buying refills only when they are needed is also good for your cashflow, because a more urgent use for that money may come up before the backstock is ever used.

There’s also a dark side to fear-based back-up buying, Norberg says. “We saw just what ‘limited’ can do during the pandemic. The idea that toilet paper and other daily goods would run out led some people to over buy – this then led to actual shortages and people in less fortunate circumstances having to do without.”

The psychology around “limited” items extends to the limited-edition products and sets that abound at Christmas-time. Buying them is “fine as long as you use these things and they don’t end up breaking the bank,” Norberg says. “But if the fear of missing out drives you to buy things you don’t use, then it’s best to walk away.”

The more we walk away from alluring deals, the easier it becomes, but as for how to start? Norberg suggests making a shopping list and sticking to it.

She also encourages asking: “What has our past behaviour suggested? Will we really use that bottle of shampoo in the next few months? Will our child really play with that toy all the time? ”

Otherwise, a shopping high will only be maintained if we “keep buying products – but that will lead to financial ruin, a very cluttered house, and negatively impact the environment”.

That goes for gifts too. Rather than guessing, she suggests asking loved ones for wish lists. If you can’t find or afford what they want, “ask for alternatives rather than trying to figure out an alternative on your own”.

“The premise that ‘it’s the thought that counts’ really isn’t helpful as it leads people to spend money on items that just end up in landfill.”"
b7f03c01-e907-461f-acac-a830144e0815,"Imagine you put on an old coat that you haven’t worn in a while, and to your surprise find a crumpled $20 bill in your pocket. How good does it feel? Do you go up half a notch on a one to 10 mood scale, or maybe a full notch?

Let’s imagine a different scenario. You’re buying ice cream from an ice cream cart and take out a $20 bill to pay. Suddenly, a gust of wind sweeps it from your hand and into a nearby sewer grate. What does that do to your mood on the one-to-10 scale?

If you’re like most people, you feel much worse about losing $20 than you feel excited about gaining $20. That tendency is called loss aversion, one among many dangerous judgment errors that behavioral scientists call cognitive biases. The mental blind spot called loss aversion is one of the most fundamental insights of a field of behavioral science called prospect theory in the last few decades.

Loss aversion is one of the three key reasons why our minds get sucked–and suckered–into Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales. Retailers know that our intuitive reaction is to avoid losses, with research showing this drive might be up to twice as powerful as the desire to make gains. By offering short-term sales, available only on Black Friday or Cyber Monday, they tap into our deep intuition to protect ourselves from the loss of the opportunity represented by the sale.

Similarly, loss aversion helps explain why so many marketing techniques involve trial periods and free returns. Retailers know that, once you buy something, you’ll be averse to losing it.

In a classic research study illustrating this tendency, participants were divided into two groups: one was given a chocolate bar and the other a mug. Then, they were offered the chance to trade what they had for the other object. Of the students given the mug first, only 11% chose to trade it for the chocolate bar, and only 10% of the students who got the chocolate first exchanged it for the mug.

We want whatever we have–the opportunity to buy something at a lower price during a short time period during Black Friday or Cyber Monday sales–and are reluctant to lose it.

In fact, behavioral scientists have a special term for people assigning excessive value to whatever they have and being reluctant to give it up: the endowment effect, a specific form of loss aversion.

Let’s imagine a different scenario. It’s Cyber Monday, and you decided to check out the deals on an e-commerce website. You go there, feeling confident you’ll only get one or two of the best deals.

But once you visit the website, you’re hooked. All those deals look great, with the prices so much lower than usual. You can’t pass them up! So you end up taking advantage of a bunch of deals and purchase much more than you intended to in the first place.

Why did that happen? Why couldn’t you control yourself? It’s due to a cognitive bias called the restraint bias.

We substantially overestimate the extent to which we can restrain our impulses. In other words, we have less self-control and weaker willpower than we like to think we do.

That’s why so many people overeat at buffet restaurants. If we had good self-control, buffet restaurants would be great. We could get our favorite dishes at a cheaper price than in ordinary restaurants. Yet the problem is that we overestimate our ability to control our impulsive desire to take more food, and loss aversion causes us to try to avoid losing the opportunity to take the wide variety of food available at buffets.

Black Friday and Cyber Monday are the shopping equivalent of buffet restaurants. So many tempting deals around, with loss aversion driving us to not want to lose out, all resulting in shopping much more than we wanted.

The final key psychological reason why you get sucked into Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales is that you’re reading this article. Here’s the thing: the abundance of news stories, advertisements, and social media posts around Black Friday and Cyber Monday makes it seem like everyone is thinking about sales on those days and looking for good deals.

As a consequence, our minds drive us to jump on the bandwagon of getting into Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales, a tendency that scientists call the bandwagon effect. When we perceive other people aligning around something, we are predisposed to join them. After all, they wouldn’t be doing it if it wasn’t a good idea, right?

Loss aversion, restraint bias, and the bandwagon effect are mental blindspots that impact decision-making in all life areas, ranging from the future of work to mental fitness. Fortunately, recent research has shown effective and pragmatic strategies to defeat these dangerous judgment errors, such as by using decision aids to constrain our shopping choices.

A useful strategy for Black Friday and Cyber Monday involves deciding in advance the purchases you’d like to make if they are on sale and buying them online instead of in the store.

For example, you might decide to buy a certain laptop if it’s more than 20% off, or a specific big-screen TV if it’s 30% off. Save the website pages of the laptop or TV that you want to buy, and then visit them on Black Friday and Cyber Monday to see if they’re on sale. If they’re not, be disciplined, and don’t buy something else, as you’re likely to get stuck buying much more than you wanted, and some deals are actually too good to be true. Instead, wait for the Christmas sale.

If you’re a business leader, consider how you can engage with loss aversion, restraint bias, and the bandwagon effect among your customers, whether on Black Friday and Cyber Monday or throughout the year–and consider sharing this article with your employees to help them make smart decisions this holiday shopping season.

Investors will see a shortened session Friday to end a holiday-abbreviated week on Wall Street.

U.S. stock exchanges were closed for Thanksgiving Day on Thursday, and reopen only for an abbreviated session on Black Friday, with trading ending at 1 p.m. Eastern.

The U.S. bond market was also closed on Thursday. It will also see an early finish, closing at 2 p.m. on Black Friday.

Through Wednesday’s session, stocks were on track to keep with the positive historical track record for Thanksgiving week, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite each up 1.3% and the S&P 500 rising 1.6%.

It has been a rough year in financial markets with the major equity benchmarks in a bear market and most bond categories producing negative returns. As a proxy for the bond market, the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF is down roughly 15% on the year so far, according to FactSet. That compares with the S&P 500 index’s 15.5% drop in 2022.

The good news for next year might be that rates finally reach a peak, which could help stabilize markets. The benchmark 10-year Treasury rate was near 3.7% early Friday this week, up from a low of 1.3% in December, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Higher rates push up borrowing costs for households and businesses, with the aim of slowing demand, and the economy.

76c9aee8-1294-4476-97d2-e76e913ed985,"ACMA Gives Telstra a Slap on the Wrist for Financial Hardship Noncompliance

Telstra has been ordered by the ACMA to comply with financial hardship rules.

The order follows an investigation by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) that found Telstra took credit management action against 70 customers who were on a financial hardship arrangement.

As the ACMA explained, under the Telecommunications Consumer Protections (TCP) Code, telcos must suspend credit management action, which can include service suspensions, disconnections or debt collection, while a financial hardship arrangement is being discussed or is in place.

Of the 70 customers impacted between August 2019 and April 2022, the ACMA said 22 had their services restricted, four had services suspended, five were disconnected and two were referred to outside collection agencies. Other actions, the ACMA said, included letters or calls requesting payment.

These cases were boiled down to two of the telco’s legacy IT systems not talking to each other properly.

The ACMA explained that as a result of the two Telstra legacy IT systems, a status update of the customers involved was either blocked or the update was delayed.

While 70 customers were affected, for 61 of them, the issue was resolved within 24 hours.

“Over three years, 70 customers who were on a financial hardship arrangement with Telstra were subject to credit management action. We found and fixed the vast majority of these errors quickly, but we’re sorry that our processes let these customers down,” a Telstra spokesperson told Gizmodo Australia.

The spokesperson further elaborated on the IT issue.

“The issue was caused by legacy systems not synchronising properly and we are well on the way to ensuring this is a thing of the past, by replacing these old systems with seamless digital experiences,” they added.

“In the meantime, we have implemented IT fixes and regular manual checks to prevent further issues while we complete our systems overhaul.”

The ACMA brought up prior enforcement in its statement, saying there has been “multiple recent ACMA enforcement actions against Telstra for a range of issues due to problems with legacy IT systems”.

“Telstra must continue to address these longstanding issues as a matter of urgency so that its systems can deliver on customer safeguards,” Acting ACMA Chair Creina Chapman said.

No fine has been issued to Telstra, but Chapman took the opportunity to mention that any further non-compliance could lead to significant consequences for Telstra, with penalties of up to $250,000 for failing to comply with the ACMA direction."

2f6dcd63-1f50-452e-883a-dc7c071bad3b,"US stocks and Treasuries rallied while the dollar fell following the report, as investors took a dovish message from the minutes.

At the meeting, officials raised the benchmark rate 0.75 of a percentage point for a fourth straight time to 3.75 per cent to 4 per cent, extending the most aggressive tightening campaign since the 1980s to combat inflation at a 40-year high.

Ellen Meade, a former Fed board economist who researched communication, said the word “various” is a rarely used term deployed when ambiguity is needed.

“If the minutes had said ‘several’ people thought the terminal rate would be higher – that’s not a strong message,” she said. “So they needed to fuzz it up.”

Investors expect the Fed to raise rates by 0.50 of a percentage point when they meet on December 13-14 and see rates peaking around 5 per cent by mid-2023. Mr Powell has a chance to influence those expectations in a speech in Washington scheduled for November 30.

Strategically, Ms Meade expects Mr Powell to continue to lean against easing financial conditions and somewhat resilient economic data.

“They have been expecting the economy to have slowed a bit. It has but not as much as they have been expecting,” said Ms Meade who is now a research professor at Duke University’s economics department. “They can’t stop the rate increases until they see some measured evidence that the economy is slowing.”

Officials discussed the effects of lags in monetary policy and the effects on the economy and inflation, and how soon cumulative tightening would begin to impact spending and hiring. A number of Fed officials said a slower pace of rate increases would allow the central bankers to judge progress on their goals.

“The FOMC minutes reveal a surprisingly strong dovish tendency on the committee as well as at the staff level,” Anna Wong, chief US economist, said.

“There is widespread agreement within the committee to slow the pace of rates hikes – a view championed by vice-chairwoman Lael Brainard, in our view – but little conviction on how high rates should go.”

The Fed said in its policy statement that rates would continue rising to a “sufficiently restrictive” level, while taking account of cumulative tightening and policy lags.

Officials in September saw rates reaching 4.4 per cent by the end of this year and 4.6 per cent in 2023. They will update those quarterly forecasts at their December meeting.

Since the November gathering, economic data have shown modest growth with some signs of slowing inflation amid still strong demand for labor. Employers added 261,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate rose slightly to 3.7 per cent, though it remains very low on a historic basis.

Financial conditions have also eased since the early November rate increase, with lower yields on government 10-year notes and higher US equity markets.

“The big picture remains in our view that the Fed intends to slow down in order to allow more time for lags to operate and cumulative tightening to date to show up in the data,” Evercore ISI’s head of central bank strategy Krishna Guha wrote in a note to clients.

“The hawkish talk from Powell in the press conference and many Fed officials subsequently is intended to provide air cover for the slowing to take place without an excessive easing of financial conditions.”

152ee0f1-d7a6-4a77-96a2-873cd32ff911,"(Bloomberg) -- US stocks ended Wednesday’s session higher after the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting minutes showed most officials backing slowing the pace of interest-rate hikes soon.

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 notched gains for a second straight session. Treasuries rallied, with the benchmark 10-year yield around 3.69%. Wall Street’s fear gauge, the Cboe Volatility Index, fell to its lowest level in more than three months. US stock and bond markets will be closed on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday.

Several Fed officials backed the need to moderate the pace of rate hikes, the central bank’s Nov. 1-2 meeting minutes show. Only a small number of these officials underscored the need for a higher terminal rate. Since the Fed’s latest meeting, investors have parsed a bevy of economic data that somewhat eased inflation concerns, further strengthening the case for smaller rate hikes.

“The minutes were dovish as they recognized a softening in consumer demand and tightening international economic and financial conditions,” said Jay Hatfield of Infrastructure Capital Management.

Still, some investors think that the meeting minutes didn’t convey anything new and that markets may be overreacting to the perceived shift in tone.

“The minutes said that hikes can be smaller than 75bps but also that the terminal rate will need to be higher than previously thought -- which also is pretty much what everyone at the Fed has been signaling anyway,” said Max Gokhman, chief investment officer at asset manager AlphaTrAI. “It’s almost weird we’re getting any kind of big moves on the minutes. I guess the market is happy to take a longer road to a more painful outcome given the reaction to the minutes.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A ""substantial majority"" of policymakers at the Federal Reserve's meeting early this month agreed it would ""likely soon be appropriate"" to slow the pace of interest rate hikes as debate broadened over the implications of the U.S. central bank's rapid tightening of monetary policy, according to the minutes from the session.

The readout of the Nov. 1-2 meeting, at which the Fed raised its policy rate by three-quarters of a percentage point for the fourth straight time, showed officials were largely satisfied they could stop front-loading the rate increases and move in smaller, more deliberate steps as the economy adjusted to more expensive credit.

""A slower pace ... would better allow the (Federal Open Market) Committee to assess progress toward its goals of maximum employment and price stability,"" said the minutes, which were released on Wednesday. ""The uncertain lags and magnitudes associated with the effects of monetary policy actions on economic activity and inflation were among the reasons cited.""

But the minutes also showed an emerging debate within the Fed over the risks the rapid policy tightening could pose to economic growth and financial stability, even as policymakers acknowledged there had been little demonstrable progress on inflation and that rates still needed to rise.

While ""a few participants"" said slower rate hikes could reduce risks to the financial system, ""a few other participants"" noted that any slowing of the Fed's policy tightening pace should await ""more concrete signs that inflation pressures were receding significantly.""

In its Nov. 2 policy statement, the Fed hinted at emerging concerns about the risks of policy tightening, saying the ""pace of future increases"" would ""take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.""

""Many participants commented that there was significant uncertainty about the ultimate level of the federal funds rate needed to achieve the Committee's goals"" the minutes said, language suggesting Fed officials shifting focus from the size of individual rate hikes to trying to calibrate a stopping point.

The Fed will hold its next policy meeting on Dec. 13-14. In addition to a policy statement, the central bank will also release new policymaker projections for the path of interest rates, inflation and unemployment.

Investors in contracts tied to the Fed's policy rate show investors expect a half-percentage-point increase at that meeting.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -World equities rose while U.S. Treasury yields retreated on Wednesday after minutes of the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting showed U.S. central bankers looking to soon moderate the pace of interest rate hikes.

A ""substantial majority"" of Fed policymakers agreed it would ""likely soon be appropriate"" to slow the pace of interest rate hikes, the meeting minutes showed. Traders had expected the Fed minutes would affirm officials' softening stance after recent data showed a moderation in economic conditions.

U.S. Labor Department data on Wednesday showed jobless claims increased more than expected last week. U.S. business activity contracted for a fifth month in November, according to the S&P Global flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index.

""I didn't really think there were any surprises. They seem to still be pointing out that the risks of inflation are still high and recent data has been more persistent than they thought,"" said Jordan Kahn, chief investment officer at ACM Funds in Los Angeles.

""People are going to get excited when they see that some participants were mentioning the need to slow the pace of rate hikes. But the market was already pricing in a 50 basis point rate hike for December and the odds in the Fed futures market of a 50-basis point hike was already 70% going into this minutes,"" Kahn added.

The MSCI All Country stock index was up 0.85%, while European shares rose 0.6%.

U.S. Treasury yields traded lower after the Fed minutes. Benchmark 10-year notes were down to 3.6908% while the yields on two-year notes dropped to 4.4773%.

The yield curve that compares these two bonds was still in negative territory, at -76.30 basis points. When inverted, that part of the curve is seen as an indicator of an upcoming recession.

""The Fed has been hiking rates at 75 basis points and it was just unrealistic for them to continue at that pace,"" Kahn added.

On Wall Street, all three major indexes closed higher, led by gains in technology, consumer discretionary, communications, healthcare and industrial stocks.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.28% to 34,194.06, the S&P 500 gained 0.59% to 4,027.26 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.99% to 11,285.32.

Oil prices fell more than 3%, continuing a streak of volatile trading as the Group of Seven (G7) nations considered a price cap on Russian oil above the current market level and as gasoline inventories in the United States built by more than analysts' expected.

Brent futures for January delivery fell 3.3% to settle at $85.41 a barrel, while U.S. crude fell 4.36% to $77.42 per barrel.

The U.S. dollar fell across the board after the Fed minutes. The dollar index fell 0.915%, with the euro up 0.9% to $1.0395.

That somewhat complicated messaging came out of the minutes of the Fed’s November Open Market Committee meeting that were released in the US on Wednesday. It was received, if not enthusiastically, then positively by financial markets, with the US sharemarket edging up and bond yields edging down.

While the slower, longer and higher outlook for the trajectory of US interest rates is consistent with the recently expressed views of several prominent Fed members, which were regarded as relatively hawkish – some have indicated that the Fed’s targeted range for its federal funds rate (the US equivalent of the Reserve Bank’s cash rate) could be above five per cent next year and potentially significantly above five per cent – it underscores the inherent uncertainties in setting monetary policies.

In essence, the Fed officials are unsure about the cumulative impacts of the aggressive rate hikes they’ve already made this year on inflation and the economy."

It is the second court action relating to crypto in the past two months, after ASIC sued Gold Coast-based BPS Financial over a crypto product known as Qoin in October, alleging unlicensed conduct and the misleading promotion of crypto assets.

It also follows action against funds operated by Holon Investments Australia, which involved interim stop orders being issued to prevent Holon offering or distributing three crypto funds to retail investors because of non-compliant target market determinations. Holon, which was trying to operate under a managed investment scheme structure, has since closed the funds.

Block Earner said in a statement: “Although we understand the backdrop, this is a disappointing outcome. We welcome regulation in our space and have spent considerable resources building regulatory infrastructure to be able to deliver a whole

suite of services to Australian users in a regulated and compliant manner under existing guidelines provided by ASIC.”

The increased regulatory attention is the latest headache for the troubled crypto sector, still reeling after the collapse of FTX and with other major players like bitcoin miner Iris Energy coming under intense pressure.

It also comes after Finder closed its controversial Earn product, a similar offering that allowed customers to invest in stablecoins for a fixed return. Unlike Block Earner, Finder is licensed to provide financial services as a representative of Centra Wealth. However, a disclaimer on the Finder website explains its Earn product was not offered under that or any other licence.

ASIC’s actions comes despite a lack of regulation in the space making it unclear how crypto products ought to operate under existing laws. It is understood that major law firm Gilbert+Tobin provided legal advice to Block Earner.

ASIC’s action against Block Earner comes after the US Securities and Exchange commission targeted ‘decentralised finance’ (DeFi) earlier this year via a regulatory action against BlockFi. This led to it paying $US100 million in penalties and pledging to register its product with US regulators.

ASIC has alleged Block Earner’s fixed rate USD Earner product (based on the stablecoin USD Coin), Gold Earner product (based on Paxos Gold) and Crypto Earner product (based on bitcoin and ethereum) were financial products for the purposes of the Corporations Act 2001.

It is seeking declarations, injunctions, and pecuniary penalties from the court.

Block Earner appears to be still offering access to variable yields via Aave and Compound, which are not the subject of the current legal action, according to its website.

Block Earner commenced offering products to consumers in March. The Australian Financial Review reported that month that Block Earner considered itself a “digital currency exchange” (DCE), so thought it only had to meet a light-touch AUSTRAC registration process and did not require oversight from ASIC.

ASIC notified it of its concerns last week, at which time it ceased the marketing of the fixed rate Earner products.

Block Earner said it has applied for an Australian Credit Licence and advised ASIC of its intention to apply for an AFSL. It said it “will continue to operate in the space and build innovative products to bridge the gap between traditional finance and blockchain-based finance under new guidance from ASIC”.

Its statement said the “lack of clarity around regulation in Australia for cryptocurrency-related products creates friction between regulators and innovators like Block Earner in our industry” and, ideally, it would have been able to build in “a regulatory sandbox” that provided it with more clarity around the licensing regime.

“In the future, we look forward to working with ASIC and other regulators in this space to make Australia an innovative space for the crypto industry.”"

Karaboga said since inception, customers' funds have been protected against events like the recent collapse of crypto exchange FTX and that a lack of regulatory clarity ""creates friction between regulators and innovators."" The company, which has backing from crypto exchange Coinbase, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from CoinDesk."
445962b2-32eb-45ab-aef3-451c98b1ffb4,"The corporate regulator has launched legal action alleging crypto platform Block Earner has been providing financial products without the proper licence, exposing customers to risk and leaving them without appropriate protections.

Block Earner, the trading name of Web3 Ventures Pty Ltd, is a digital currency exchange pitched as a way for less crypto-savvy investors to put money into decentralised finance (DeFi) products that provide annual yields. It started offering a number of fixed-yield earning products – called USD Earner, Gold Earner and Crypto Earner – in March.

However, the company stopped marketing them last week after the Australian Securities and Investments Commission notified Block Earner of its concerns that they were financial products, which require a licence.

In Federal Court documents filed on Tuesday, ASIC alleges that by failing to provide investors with the protections that come with a licence, “consumers were exposed to risk and made an uninformed (or inadequately informed) or unsuitable investment, and ultimately [were] exposed to loss”."

In data released on Wednesday, weekly initial jobless claims rose by 17,000 to 240,000 in the week that ended Nov. 19, the highest level since August. Consumer sentiment remained depressed after November’s mid-term elections, and S&P Global surveys of business executives pointed to flagging economic growth. Although durable-goods orders jumped 1% in October, the momentum is seen as not likely to last as the U.S. economy slows.

The spread between 2- and 10-year Treasury yields ended the New York session at minus 77.3 basis points and remained at its most inverted level since Oct. 5, 1981 — a sign that some say points to an inevitable recession.

U.S. stock exchanges will be closed for Thanksgiving Day on Thursday, Nov. 24, and will reopen the next day for an abbreviated session on Black Friday, the annual end-of-year shopping event, with trading ending at 1 p.m. Eastern on Nov. 25. The bond market also will be closed for Thanksgiving Day and reopen the next day for an abbreviated session and will close at 2 p.m.



Overseas, Chinese cities imposed more COVID-19 restrictions on Wednesday to combat rising virus cases, heightening global economic growth concerns. The global economy is slowing, but economists now think it may not be as bad as initially feared.

0d818389-047b-4f3a-b209-2edd231dadd2,"Income investors love their high-yielding dividends, but they’re not too happy when rough times force real estate investment trusts (REITs) to cut the dividends. Take a look at three REITs currently offering dividends of 10% or more and whether they can maintain these high yields in future quarters.

Sabra Health Care REIT Inc. (NASDAQ: SBRA) is an Irvine, California-based healthcare REIT that specializes in skilled nursing, behavioral health and senior housing. Sabra Health Care owns 407 total facilities spread among 72 operators across the U.S.

The current dividend of $1.20 yields about 10% at a recent price of $11.98, but is this dividend sustainable? Several key aspects of Sabra Health Care REIT may be falling short.

In 2017, Sabra Health Care REIT paid a quarterly dividend of $0.45. For the next two years, it never raised its dividend. Then in May 2020, after the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the dividend was cut to $0.30. That’s understandable, but unlike many other REITs, Sabra Health Care REIT has not raised its dividend since then.

In addition, the ratio of the dividend to forward annual funds from operation (FFO) is now 80%. This high ratio is a red flag as it doesn’t leave much room for dividend coverage.

Another negative was that third-quarter operating results missed analysts’ expectations on revenue by 12% and FFO of $0.28 was less than the $0.30 paid out in dividends. If this is just a one-time event, Sabra Health Care REIT can handle it, but if this persists, it might be forced to cut the dividend to a level below its FFO.

Service Properties Trust (NASDAQ: SVC) is a diversified REIT with a portfolio of 242 hotels and 766 service-focused net lease retail outlets that covers 46 states, Puerto Rico and Canada.

At its recent closing price of $7.63, Service Properties Trust’s annual dividend of $0.80 now yields 10.4%. However, its five-year dividend history has not been great. In 2020, Service Properties Trust cut its quarterly dividend from $0.54 to just $0.01. It remained that way until October 2022 when it was raised to $0.20.

Story continues

Third-quarter earnings were markedly improved as normalized FFO of $0.54 doubled the $0.27 mark from the third quarter of 2021. Net income was a loss of $0.05 but well ahead of the loss of $0.36 from the third quarter of 2021.

The $1.44 forward FFO easily covers the new forward $0.80 dividend with a payout ratio of 55%.

Despite the lackluster dividend history, it would appear from the recent dividend reinstatement and improved third-quarter results that Service Properties Trust could be a good candidate to maintain its dividend going forward.

Brandywine Realty Trust (NYSE: BDN) is a Philadelphia-based office REIT that owns, develops, leases and manages 175 properties totaling 24 million square feet from its Pennsylvania headquarters to Austin, Texas.

The 52-week range of Brandywine Realty Trust is $5.95 to $14.88, and like so many other REITs, its stock price has been decimated by higher interest rates this year. The share price is only about 8% higher since touching the lows in mid-October.

Brandywine Realty Trust’s quarterly dividend of $0.19 has been a stable but slow grower over the past five years and presently yields 11.7% annually. Even during the worst of the pandemic, it never cut nor eliminated the dividend. Its most recent quarterly dividend of $0.19 was paid on Oct. 20. The five-year dividend average is only 5.8%, so while Brandywine Realty Trust may be undervalued, the question is can it sustain its 11.7% dividend yield going forward?

Third-quarter 2022 FFO of $0.36 was a penny better than the third quarter of 2021. The price/FFO is currently at 4.74, and the dividend coverage by the forward annual dividend is only 55%. Both of these numbers suggest that while the company may be facing headwinds for a while longer, with its stable dividend and improving FFO, Brandywine Realty Trust should be able to maintain its dividend even with the current inflationary environment.

The shift from actively managed to passive index-tracking funds has accelerated this year, boosted by a jump in flows to bond and mixed-asset funds, research from JPMorgan shows.

The share of assets under management held in US-domiciled passive bond and hybrid funds — which invest in more than one asset class, for example, equity, fixed income and gold — rose from 23 per cent of all equivalent US fund assets at the end of 2019 to 28.5 per cent by August 2022.

“There is a secular move as a greater number of advisers use low-cost passive bond investments to replace their active bond managers,” said Peter Sleep, senior portfolio manager at 7 Investment Management.

Passive funds’ share of total US-domiciled equity fund assets under management passed the halfway mark at the beginning of the year, rising less steeply than their fixed income counterparts from a 46 per cent share at the end of 2019 to 52 per cent by August this year, JPMorgan found.

Sleep said that bond exchange traded funds were now catching up with their more broadly adopted equity ETF counterparts as the offering had broadened and become more cost competitive. The vast majority of ETFs are passively managed and follow an index.

The increase in flows to passive fixed income funds was all the more notable given the rapid and dramatic sell-off in bonds this year, Sleep said.

“But bonds now are at multiyear lows and investors can see value in areas like long-duration government bonds and corporate debt,” he added.

Jane Sloan, head of iShares and index investing Emea at BlackRock, pointed out that half of all inflows into global ETFs this year had been into bond ETFs, but she said the flows only told part of the story.

“Trading volumes in bond ETFs across the global industry are up 35 per cent since both 2020 and 2021, which indicates more people are using ETFs to trade bonds as they move within fixed income asset classes,” Sloan added.

For some investors there is a further incentive for exiting their actively managed fixed income fund — tax loss harvesting.

“Investors have losses to harvest in fixed income portfolios for the first time in many, many years. This is benefiting index ETFs as active mutual fund owners can sell their holdings at a loss to recognise a tax benefit, then rotate to ETFs to maintain their asset allocation,” said Drew Pettit, director of ETF analysis and strategy at Citi Research.

Data from EPFR indicate that the movement from active to passive funds is not just happening in the US but is a global phenomenon. Cumulative global fund flows for the year to mid-October show that passive equity and bond funds attracted $379bn and $178bn respectively, while active equity and bond funds bled $215bn and $442bn respectively.

“With so much value around it is quicker and easier for investors to capture the market returns through keenly priced tracker funds or ETFs than launch a search for an active manager. International ETF flow data for October 2022 showed that investors bought all sectors except inflation-protected bonds,” Sleep said."

JPMorgan Asset Management has become the latest global asset manager to move in to Australia’s growing exchange traded funds market after listing two actively managed ETFs on the Australian Securities Exchange.

The JPMorgan Global Research Enhanced Index Equity Active ETF and the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income Active ETF are also the first ETFs the US fund house has listed onshore anywhere in the Asia-Pacific region.

JPMAM’s debut in the market follows robust growth in Australia’s ETF industry, which saw assets balloon by a record 44 per cent in 2021 to A$136.9bn ($87.5bn), while inflows increased by 28 per cent year on year to A$25.9bn.

This year industry assets shrunk by 9 per cent during the first half to A$124.3bn, but Australian ETFs still attracted A$6.2bn in net new money.

This article was previously published by Ignites Asia, a title owned by the FT Group.

The US firm follows in the footsteps of other major global asset managers that have launched actively managed ETFs in Australia.

Fidelity International launched its first active ETF in late October 2018 and rolled out a second product in December 2021. Earlier this year, Janus Henderson listed its net-zero-themed ETF in Australia, bringing its total active ETFs in the market to three.

Last month, UK-based asset manager Abrdn launched an actively managed, sustainability-themed ETF in Australia, which is also its first ETF in any Asia-Pacific market.

The JPMorgan Equity Premium Income Active ETF feeds into the original US master fund listed on the New York Stock Exchange in May 2020.

JPMorgan said that the US vehicle had reached $13bn in assets faster than any other ETF globally and attracted $3.5bn in net new assets in the third quarter alone.

The JPMorgan Equity Premium Income Active ETF aims to deliver monthly distributable income with lower volatility than the US stock market.

“We believe that it will really appeal to Australian investors as the search for income continues in this inflationary environment,” Mark Carlile, head of wholesale, Australia and New Zealand, said.

Meanwhile, the JPMorgan Global Research Enhanced Index Equity Active ETF, which has a total fund size of $87mn, is described as an active global equities solution that leverages JPMAM’s Global Equity Platform.

It mimics the MSCI World ex-Australia benchmark, which is country, sector and style neutral, while also being actively managed by over 90 research analysts who cover more than 2,500 stocks."

The Wall Street investment bank said Monday it expects returns to be a “relatively low” 6 per cent through the end of 2023 as investors focus on the pace of monetary policy tightening and the consequent hit to growth and earnings.

“We continue to think that the near-term path for equity markets is likely to be volatile and down before reaching a final trough in 2023,” Goldman Sachs said in a note.

It expects the S&P 500 index to be around the 4,000-points level towards the end of 2023, implying an increase of less than 1 per cent from current levels, as it sees no earning growth.

Goldman expects earnings for the constituents in the Pan-European STOXX 600 index to slide 8 per cent next year, while forecasting a 3 per cent earnings growth for companies in Japan’s TOPIX and MSCI’s Asia-Pacific ex-Japan indexes.

The investment bank expects investors to start to price in expectations for a bull market next year.

“We expect markets to transition into a ‘Hope’ phase of the next bull market at some point in 2023, but from a lower level.”

Stocks to ponder

Walmart Inc. (WMT-N) The retailing giant is warning of a tough environment for consumer spending, adding a powerful voice to the chorus of concerns about the United States economy. Yet, Walmart’s share price rallied 6.5 per cent last Tuesday, after it reported its latest quarterly financial results, and the share price is up 3.8 per cent this year. Why are investors so keen on the stock? David Berman has some answers.

Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. (AQN-T) John Heinzl has been a shareholder of the utility for more than a decade, and it’s been a terrific investment until now. Thanks to a combination of organic growth and profitable acquisitions, the renewable power producer and utility operator has steadily increased its asset base, earnings and dividends, rewarding shareholders with double-digit total returns. That all changed on Nov. 11, when Algonquin posted third-quarter results below expectations, cut its 2022 earnings forecast and warned that its long-term growth targets are in doubt. The stock has cratered more than 30 per cent since then, and investors are bracing for a potential dividend cut. As such, our columnist has sold the stock in his Yield Hog dividend growth portfolio, and some of his own shares as well. He says Algonquin should now focus on fixing two things: its stretched finances, and investors’ broken trust.

This could be a great year for tax-loss selling using ETFs – if you avoid these pitfalls

Exchange-traded funds are prized for their low cost and liquidity, but they will also prove invaluable as a simple and effective tax-loss harvesting vehicle amid this year’s market rout. Under federal tax laws, investors who sell a particular stock, bond or fund to gain a tax loss must wait 30 days under the Canada Revenue Agency’s “superficial tax loss” rule. The rule is inconvenient for those who want to maintain exposure to a specific security. But ETF investors can easily satisfy the tax rule by buying a fund that is somewhat different than the one they just sold at a capital loss within their non-registered, taxable portfolios.

6ed3dc1b-15f3-4317-a104-a2549de1cefb,"“The bear market is not over” is what Goldman Sachs strategist Peter Oppenheimer told the bank’s clients in today’s note.

Oppenheimer believes the conditions, which are typical for an environment where equities bottom, have not yet been reached. The strategist expects lower valuations from here, which should coincide with a “trough in the momentum of growth deterioration and a peak in interest rates.” Only then, a sustained recovery could begin, Oppenheimer wrote in a note.

The Fed continues to aggressively increase interest rates in a bid to cool inflation. Goldman Sachs top economist, Jan Hatzius expects the FOMC to slow the pace of rate hikes, although his expectations are still above the current consensus.

Oppenheimer sees the speed at which the Fed is raising rates as damaging for valuations.

“We continue to think that the near-term path for equity markets is likely to be volatile and down before reaching a final trough in 2023. So while near-term risks are to the downside in global equities, it is likely that they enter a 'Hope' phase in 2023; we expect overall returns between now and the end of next year to be relatively low,” the strategist added.

Along these lines, Goldman Sachs strategists advise clients to take “a barbell approach,” which combines “quality, strong balance sheet and stable margin companies with deep value, energy and resources, where valuation risks are limited.”

“We like companies that can compound earnings and returns through a combination of reinvestment and dividends over time. In contrast to the last cycle, more diversification across styles and regions, as well as a greater focus on valuation, should enhance returns over the course of 2023,” he concluded.

ab428ea6-f622-4257-a1a2-18606c6d7038,"The bear market isn’t anywhere close to being over and investors shouldn’t be getting too excited about what the new year will bring for their stock holdings, according to [hotlink]Goldman Sachs[/hotlink].

The authors of Goldman’s note suggested that investors shouldn’t be deceived by the recent gains into thinking equities were back on an upward trajectory, arguing the recent rally was not sustainable.

“The conditions that are typically consistent with an equity trough have not yet been reached,” strategists at the investment banking giant said in a note on Monday.

They argued that before a prolonged recovery could go ahead, interest rates needed to peak and stock valuations needed to fall to levels more in line with a recession.

Goldman’s strategists estimated that the S&P 500 would end 2023 at 4,000 points—only around 1% higher than the level it was trading at on Monday morning. The index is down almost 20% so far this year.

Global equity markets have rallied in recent weeks on the back of softer-than-expected U.S. inflation data—but stocks on Wall Street edged lower during early trade on Monday ahead of a string of retail earnings, a speech from the Fed and the Thanksgiving holiday.

“The near-term path for equity markets is likely to be volatile and down,” they said, noting that stocks don’t usually recover from their bottoms until slowdowns in the economy and corporate earnings decelerate.

Goldman’s analysts are the latest market watchers to throw cold water on whether the rally seen over the past couple of weeks means stocks have begun to emerge from the bear market.

Just over a week ago, billionaire investor Carl Icahn said he remained “quite bearish on what is going to happen” in equity markets, while veteran economist Nouriel Roubini told Fortune earlier this month that stocks had a further 20% to fall.

Meanwhile, analysts at Glenmede warned at the end of October that based on historical evidence, equities may still only be two-thirds of the way through the current bear market.

The market is still a long way from seeing stocks hit a bottom or interest rates coming down despite good news on the inflation after October's Consumer Price Index reading, according to Goldman Sachs chief equities strategist Peter Oppenheimer.

""We don't typically get markets reaching trough until interest rates start to come down, and we're still a little way away from that,"" Oppenheimer warned in an interview with Bloomberg on Monday, dismissing recent gains spurred by news of China's reopening, falling gas prices, and cooling US inflation.

Those events have fueled hope the Federal Reserve could soon pause its aggressive rate hikes, which have weighed heavily on stocks throughout the year. But equities still have room to fall, Oppenheimer argued, pointing to the fact that the S&P 500 is still trading a price-to-earnings multiple of 17x, a sign that stocks are still considerably overvalued. And despite the recent rally, some analysts expect US earnings growth to clock in close to zero next year, he warned, with a more severe slowdown in European earnings.

That's because companies are still struggling with high interest rates and a soaring US dollar. Morgan Stanley's top stock strategist Mike Wilson predicted earnings expectations for 2023 were about 20% too high, and the S&P 500 would likely fall 24% early next year and bottom out at 3000.

Oppenheimer didn't believe a decline would be that severe, adding that bank and corporate balance sheets are still strong, and the US will likely avoid a hard landing. But he warned investors of more volatility ahead until interest rates start to coming down.

""I think the market is going to be exposed on margin to more difficult news to come through, particularly on growth in the coming months. And we don't think we've hit yet the sort of conditions that we would typically see in a genuine trough in the bear market, that helps form the case for a sustained rebound,"" Oppenheimer added.

The Fed has raised rates nearly 400-basis-points this year in its battle to tame inflation, though prices remained high at 7.7% in October. That implies rates will be elevated until prices come down closer to the Fed's 2% target. The counterargument from the bulls has been that Fed policy is in response to lagging indicators, meaning it's possible inflation is already well on the way down and the central bank risks overtightening if they press forward with rate hikes."

Billionaire investor Bill Ackman declared his support of the cryptocurrency space following the implosion of the FTX exchange, with the hedge fund boss taking to social media to outline his crypto investments as a ""hobbyist"" in the space.

""The telephone, the internet, and crypto share one thing in common. Each technology improves on the next in terms of its ability to facilitate fraud,"" Ackman said in a Tweet thread posted Sunday. ""As such, I was initially a crypto skeptic, but after studying some of the more interesting crypto projects, I have come to believe that crypto can enable the formation of useful businesses and technologies that heretofore could not be created.""

The Pershing Square Holdings hedge fund founder shared his observations as the crypto market has been in the grips of contagion fears stemming from the collapse of FTX. The world's once third-largest crypto exchange founded by Sam Bankman-Friend is seeking bankruptcy protection in the US and could leave up to 1 million creditors exposed to losses.

FTX's native token FTT plunged earlier this month after rival exchange Binance said it would sell off its holding in FTT. The move followed a CoinDesk report that said much of the balance sheet in Bankman-Fried's crypto trading firm Alameda was made up of FTT. Reports say regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission have been investigating FTX for months.

Ackman did not comment directly on FTX in his tweet thread.

""The ability to issue a token to incentivize participants in a venture is a powerful lever in accessing a global workforce to advance a project. The problem with crypto is that unethical promoters can create tokens simply to facilitate pump and dump schemes,"" he said.

Ackman told his more than 563,300 Twitter followers he's a ""small direct investor"" in crypto projects, including WiFi network Helium, bike-sharing company Limebike, Switzerland-based Origyn Foundation, whose projects include a blockchain-based fine art market, and Goldfinch Finance, a decentralized lending protocol that offers DeFi yield.

He said he's also an investor in seven crypto venture capital funds and a small investor in companies that help with tax compliance and aim to reduce fraud in crypto, citing TaxBit and TRM Labs.

""In total these investments represent less than 2% of my assets. I invest more as a hobbyist trying to learn than as a careful investor as I minimize the time I spend on non-Pershing Square investments so please don't rely on my due diligence or take any of the above as an investment recommendation,"" he said.

""All of the above said, I think crypto is here to stay and with proper oversight and regulation, it has the potential to greatly benefit society and grow the global economy,"" he said.

Ackman voiced his general support of crypto days after Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said he was launching a fund for crypto projects needing liquidity in an effort to blunt the ""cascading negative effects"" of FTX's collapse."
fda2bc2e-fc08-47f0-b418-a464786e4d0b,"Hedge fund investor Bill Ackman on Nov. 20 said he is no longer a crypto skeptic after he found interesting crypto projects that enabled the formation of useful businesses and technologies.

The telephone, the internet, and crypto share one thing in common. Each technology improves on the next in terms of its ability to facilitate fraud. As such, I was initially a crypto skeptic, but after studying some of the more interesting crypto projects, I have come to — Bill Ackman (@BillAckman) November 20, 2022

The billionaire investor highlighted how crypto projects use token issuance to incentivize global participation in the growth of the venture.

Ackman endorses Helium

Bill Ackman used Helium’s HNT as an example of how a crypto token could build intrinsic value over time.

According to Ackman, demand for HNT will build a two-sided market where Helium miners buy and deploy the decentralized network hotspot to earn its native token while users purchase the token to use the network. He said:

“Given HNT’s ultimately finite supply, the balance between supply and demand yields a market price which increases or decreases over time along with the success of the Helium Wi-Fi network. As such, HNT becomes a valued commodity whose price is determined by supply and demand.”

Ackman added that Helium miners would earn more tokens for siting their nodes where they are most needed. He also mentioned the regulatory hurdles and capital investment technology companies like Verizon would have to make to set up similar networks.

Data shows Helium rewards are negligible

Meanwhile, reports revealed that Helium had misled users about its partnerships and that its tokenomics had favored insiders. Another report noted that Helium has little to no demand, and investors’ returns have been really poor.

According to Heliumtracker.io, the highest earner on the network over the last 24 hours was Suave Pistachio Albatross, who earned 2.49 HNT ($5.56). The average price of a hotspot is between $200 to $400.

CryptoSlate data showed that HNT is down 94% on the year-to-date.

Ackman reveals crypto investment

The billionaire investor revealed that he is directly invested in crypto projects like DIMO, Goldfinch Finance, and ORIGYNTech.

Ackman said he is an investor in seven crypto VC funds and a small investor in crypto companies like TRM Labs and TaxBit. The investor has no investments in Helium.

Cumulatively, these investments are less than 2% of his assets. He added that he “invests more as a hobbyist trying to learn than as a careful investor.”

Calls for more regulation

Ackman said crypto has the potential to benefit society with proper regulation and oversight greatly.

“Despite crypto’s ability to facilitate fraud, with the benefit of sensible regulation and oversight, crypto technology’s potential for beneficent societal impact may eventually compare with the impact of the telephone and internet on the economy and society.”

According to him, legitimate players in the space should be “incentivized to expose and eliminate fraudulent actors as they greatly increase the risk of regulatory intervention that will set back the positive potential impact of crypto for generations.”

The dollar and bond yields rose after St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said interest rates might need to hit a range from 5-5.25 per cent from the current level of just below 4.00 per cent to be ""sufficiently restrictive"" to curb inflation.

That was a blow to investors who had been wagering rates would peak at 5 per cent and saw Fed fund futures sell off as markets priced in more chance that rates would now top out at 5-5.25 per cent, rather than 4.75-5.0 per cent.

""The Fed has come back through their speeches and pushed back against the market narrative -- we are not going to see a pivot,"" said Arun Sai, senior multi-asset strategist at Pictet Asset Management.

Sai said the market was currently ""running on fumes"" and would switch focus to the real economy's response to rising rates, such as anecodatal signs of slowdown in the US labour market.

The MSCI world equities index edged up 0.17 per cent while US S&P futures were steady after the S&P 500 index dipped 0.3 per cent on Thursday.

European stocks gained 0.54 per cent, with banks rising nearly 1 per cent as the European Central Bank gears up to start the biggest withdrawal of cash from the euro zone's banking system in its history.

Banks are expected to repay about 500 billion euros in Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO) loans. The ECB's announcement is expected at 1105 GMT.

Britain's FTSE gained 0.33 per cent, a day after finance minister Jeremy Hunt announced tax rises and spending cuts in an effort to reassure markets that the government was serious about fighting inflation.

British retail sales staged only a partial rebound last month after shops closed in September for the funeral of Queen Elizabeth, data showed on Friday, and they remained below their pre-pandemic level as soaring inflation hit spending power.

""Although the Bank of England is likely to continue hiking rates despite a slowdown in the economy, their peak will likely be lower than in the US,"" said Dean Turner, chief euro zone and UK economist at UBS Global Wealth Management.

US two-year yields crept back up to 4.48 per cent, retracing a little of last week's sharp inflation-driven drop of 33 basis points to a low of 4.29 per cent.

That left them 69 basis points above 10-year yields , the largest inversion since 1981 and an indicator of impending recession.

The dollar was flat at 106.65 on a basket of currencies, after touching a three-month trough of 105.30 early in the week.

The US currency was steady at 140.23 yen, but held above its recent low of 137.67. Sterling rose 0.3 per cent to $1.1904.

The euro held at $1.0357, having eased from a four-month peak of $1.0481 hit on Tuesday as some policymakers argued for caution on tightening.

ECB President Christine Lagarde will give a keynote speech later on Friday that may offer guidance on which way the majority at the bank may lean. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was steady.

Chinese blue chips dropped 0.45 per cent amid reports that Beijing had asked banks to check liquidity in the bond market after soaring yields caused losses for some investors.

There were also concerns that a surge in COVID-19 cases in China would challenge plans to ease strict movement curbs that have throttled the economy.

Japan's Nikkei slipped 0.1 per cent as data showed inflation running at a 40-year high as a weak yen stoked import costs.

Still, the Bank of Japan argues that inflation is mostly driven by energy costs outside of its control and that the economy needs continued super-easy policies.

There's optimism in the air, based on some early Black Friday projections.

Mastercard SpendingPulse sees Black Friday sales rising a hearty 15% year over year, and Walmart sees its U.S. division posting a 3% same-store sales increase in the fourth quarter.

But the former retail analyst in me thinks companies and investors will have a relatively subdued holiday shopping season for one big reason: Inflation remains omnipresent on the minds of consumers.

Consequently, 15% Black Friday sales growth is a huge call inside of a barely growing economy, and Walmart's outlook is quite aggressive given that Thanksgiving dinner will cost 20% more this year.

Other data corroborates this view: In a new Goldman Sachs survey, roughly 55% of respondents said they plan to buy fewer items this year as a result of the challenging macroeconomic backdrop. Some consumers plan on not only buying less, but also trading down to cheaper price points and quality levels.

Another survey out of Citi found that all income brackets indicated they planned to spend less, with the greatest percent of respondents indicating the decision was due to having less money to spend and because of high fuel and food prices.

Makes sense based on what retail execs are telling me.

“I think we're going to be operating in a very uncertain environment,"" Target Chairman and CEO Brian Cornell told me. ""A consumer that's clearly facing the challenges of managing a budget, and they're going to be looking for promotions. So we'll be preparing for that.""

Walmart's CFO John David Rainey told me consumers are ""looking for value,"" as if to hint the shopper will leave an item on the shelf if the value equation isn't right.

Global purchasing managers data will shine a light on the health of the world economy, while Beijing could step up some of its promised support.

And the World Cup football bonanza kicks off in Qatar.

Here’s a look at the week ahead in markets:

Going shopping

With concerns that the U.S. economy may be on the verge of a recession, a key test of consumer demand arrives on Nov. 25, when retailers launch Black Friday sales – a day traditionally marked by long lines of shoppers eager to pounce on discounts.

Soaring inflation and surging interest rates could test buying appetite.

October U.S. retail sales increased more than expected, boosted by purchases of motor vehicles and a range of other goods, suggesting the consumer may be on more solid footing heading into year-end. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.

Retailers have offered mixed results in the most recent earnings season. Just this week, Walmart lifted its annual sales and profit forecast as demand for groceries was expected to hold up despite higher prices, while Target forecast a surprise drop in holiday-quarter sales.

Past the peak

The rise of the U.S. dollar has been the dominant trading theme of 2022, thanks to the Federal Reserve’s quest to raise interest rates to quell inflation, giving the currency an edge over its peers among investors, who have been starved of any kind of yield for at least a decade.

October’s inflation report delivered evidence that consumer price pressures have slowed for the past four straight months from June’s 41-year peak of 9.1 per cent. The dollar index, meanwhile, peaked at a 20-year high of 114.78 in September and has been falling ever since.

Now, it’s heading for its biggest quarterly loss since the second quarter of 2017, having shed 4.5 per cent in value. The time may be fast approaching for dollar bears to emerge from hibernation.

Bleak out there

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) logo is seen outside the headquarters building in Washington on Sept. 4, 2018.Yuri Gripas/Reuters

The International Monetary Fund says the global economic outlook is even gloomier than it was a month ago. Is the pessimism justified? Preliminary readings of business activity in November from a number of economies could answer the question in the coming days.

Manufacturing PMIs for October pointed to a deepening contraction in global industry, with developed markets leading the decline. In most European countries, PMIs are below the 50 marker that separates expansion from contraction – France was an exception.

Britain is already facing a lengthy recession. Euro zone economic growth has held up better than expected and labour markets remain relatively robust. But the risk of recession is still elevated for a region grappling with an energy shock and higher costs for anything from financing to wages.

Zeroing in on China

The Chinese central bank’s pledge to step up supportive policy measures should be on display on Monday, when key loan prime rates are set.

Stocks and industrial metal markets are cheering signs of pro-growth initiatives, from help for the beleaguered property market to, crucially, an easing of choking zero-COVID policies.

The COVID-19 outlook remains murky. Noises from Beijing are that “life-saving” measures are essential, which argues against making too much of a two-day reduction in quarantine times.

Other regional central banks will also be setting rates. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is tipped for a super-sized 75-basis-point hike on Wednesday, while the Bank of Korea is seen tightening again, but possibly only by a quarter of a point.

f78f3309-23f5-46ba-9bc3-02e3785e0f9e,"(Reuters) - The most important day for U.S. retailers is here and questions are rife on whether king dollar is set to lose its crown.

Global purchasing managers data will shine a light on the health of the world economy, while markets want to see whether Beijing could step up some of its promised support.

And the World Cup football bonanza is underway in Qatar.

Here's a look at the week ahead in markets from Lewis Krauskopf in New York, Kevin Buckland in Tokyo and Amanda Cooper, Dara Ranasinghe and Karin Strohecker in London.

1/GOING SHOPPING With concerns that the U.S. economy may be on the verge of a recession, a key test of consumer demand arrives on Nov. 25, when retailers launch ""Black Friday"" sales - a day traditionally marked by long lines of shoppers eager to pounce on discounts.

Soaring inflation and surging interest rates could test buying appetite. October U.S. retail sales increased more than expected, boosted by purchases of motor vehicles and a range of other goods, suggesting the consumer may be on more solid footing heading into year-end. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Retailers have offered mixed results in the most recent earnings season. Just this week, Walmart lifted its annual sales and profit forecast as demand for groceries was expected to hold up despite higher prices, while Target forecast a surprise drop in holiday-quarter sales.

2/PAST THE PEAK

The rise of the U.S. dollar has been the dominant trading theme of 2022, thanks to the Federal Reserve's quest to raise interest rates to quell inflation, giving the currency an edge over its peers among investors, who have been starved of any kind of yield for at least a decade.

October's inflation report delivered evidence that consumer price pressures have slowed for the past four straight months from June's 41-year peak of 9.1%. The dollar index, meanwhile, peaked at a 20-year high of 114.78 in September and has been falling ever since.

Now, it's heading for its biggest quarterly loss since the second quarter of 2017, having shed 4.5% in value. The time may be fast approaching for dollar bears to emerge from hibernation.

3/BLEAK OUT THERE

The International Monetary Fund says the global economic outlook is even gloomier than it was a month ago. Is the pessimism justified? Preliminary readings of business activity in November from a number of economies could answer the question in the coming days.

Manufacturing PMIs for October pointed to a deepening contraction in global industry, with developed markets leading the decline. In most European countries, PMIs are below the 50 marker that separates expansion from contraction -- France was an exception.

Britain is already facing a lengthy recession. Euro zone economic growth has held up better than expected and labour markets remain relatively robust. But the risk of recession is still elevated for a region grappling with an energy shock and higher costs for anything from financing to wages.

4/ZEROING IN ON CHINA

The Chinese central bank's pledge to step up supportive policy measures are in focus, though policymakers kept benchmark lending rates steady for a third straight month on Monday. Some had expected a cut in the five-year loan prime rate (LPR), though no change suggests the bank remains wary of stoking further yuan weakness by easing monetary conditions.

Stocks and industrial metal markets had cheered signs of pro-growth initiatives, from help for the beleaguered property market to, crucially, an easing of choking zero-COVID policies.

But the COVID outlook remains murky. Noises from Beijing are that ""life-saving"" measures are essential, which argues against making too much of a two-day reduction in quarantine times. Students in schools across several Beijing districts buckled down for online classes after officials called for residents in some of its hardest-hit areas to stay home.

Other regional central banks will also be setting rates. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is tipped for a super-sized 75 basis point hike on Wednesday, while the Bank of Korea is seen tightening again, but possibly only by a quarter of a point.

Qatar has much riding on the tournament passing off smoothly - hoping to affirm Doha's place on the global stage and for an economic boost.

With Black Friday Ahead, Investors Look to US Consumer Stocks

NEW YORK—As the most important shopping period of the year approaches, some investors are betting shares of beaten-down consumer stocks will benefit if inflation keeps falling and retail sales stay strong.

Consumer discretionary stocks, a group whose members run the gamut from Amazon.com Inc. and automaker Tesla Inc. to retailer Target Corp., have been walloped by surging prices, with the S&P 500’s consumer discretionary sector falling nearly 33 percent for the year to date compared with a nearly 17 percent fall for the broader index.

Yet recent data has shown signs that inflation may be ebbing in the face of stronger-than-expected retail spending, raising cautious optimism that the economy could avoid a recession or experience only a mild downturn. Investors poured a net $1.05 billion into consumer discretionary stocks in the past week, the sixth-largest weekly inflows since 2008, data from BofA Global Research showed.

The upcoming Black Friday, the day after the Thanksgiving holiday and traditionally one of the year’s biggest shopping days, may give investors greater insight into the extent that consumers are opening their wallets.

“There’s some questions as to how strong the consumer really is, so this will be a tricky holiday season,” said Edward Yruma, an analyst at Piper Sandler. “Everybody is watching the strength of the consumer and so far the consumer has held.”

Yruma is bullish on retailers Nordstrom Inc. and Target. He believes, however, it may be too early to bet on the sector as a whole since inflation remains high by historical standards while many on Wall Street fear the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy tightening may bring on a recession.

To be sure, consumer stocks have had more than their fair share of woes this year. Target shares plunged on Tuesday after the company warned of “dramatic changes” in consumer behavior that were hurting demand. Amazon.com, the world’s biggest online retailer, said on Oct. 27 it was preparing for slower growth because “people’s budgets are tight” due to inflation.

The companies’ shares are down 29.6 percent and 43.5 percent year-to-date, respectively. While retail sales in October were strong, data suggests that subprime auto loan delinquencies are increasing and higher-income shoppers are starting to trade down, Morgan Stanley economists said in a note on Friday.

“The consumer has been a pillar of strength this year, but as rates keep rising and the labor market slows, consumers will have no choice but to pull back on spending,” the firm’s economists wrote. The bank’s analysts are underweight the consumer discretionary sector.

Others, however, see reasons to remain bullish—even in the face of a potential economic downturn.

“Recession fears are so priced in to this group,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group. “If we have a mild recession … they will do very well from here on out.” He is betting shares of retailers, hotels, and restaurants will outperform the rest of the sector in the coming year.

Some companies’ lower valuations may also give investors wiggle room if the economy slows, said Bobby Griffin, an analyst at Raymond James. His firm has a strong “buy” on shares of Home Depot Inc., which are trading at a 15 percent discount to their historic forward price-to-earnings multiple.

“We’ve had this fear of inflation all year and the consumer has held up pretty well so far,” he said.

At the same time, signs of consumer strength could also be a red flag to the inflation-fighting Fed, bolstering the case for the central bank to push forward with the monetary policy tightening that has pressured markets and drained risk appetite this year.

Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance, believes signs that consumers are not being affected by rising rates could lead to a higher-than-expected peak in the Fed’s rate hiking cycle.

“We’re skeptical the worst is behind us,” he said.

4b6d8581-aece-4ec1-af1b-3e133dacc25a,"The housing market has cooled off in a hurry as mortgage rates hit new highs.

But home prices aren't going to fall far, according to David Kelly of JPMorgan Asset Management.

He says that a mix of high rates and high prices means limited appreciation for housing.

The housing market has gone from white-hot to cooling fast, and it's not coming back any time soon.

David Kelly, the chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, wrote in a recent note to clients that the dramatic increase in mortgage rates is likely to dampen real estate investing for years. While rates will come down eventually, it might not bring that much relief.

""The first genuine relief on mortgage rates may have to wait for the end of 2023 when the Fed may begin to take back some of its rate hikes,"" he said. ""Even then, we do not expect any return to the 4% average mortgage rate seen between 2009 and 2021.""

In less than a year, rates have surged from a little above 3% to almost 7% a few weeks ago. Kelly says that's taken the average monthly mortgage payment from about $1,200 to $2,000. That's an enormous change that has priced a lot of people out of the housing market, which helps explain the recent decline in foot traffic by prospective buyers.

Adding to the complications, the spread between Treasury bond rates and mortgage rates has increased, which creates another tiny barrier to affordability.

While a big drop in demand should lead to lower prices in theory, Kelly says that probably won't happen here. Factors like slow population growth and very low vacancy rates will support prices before they get too much lower. Meanwhile, homebuilders have responded to rising rates by cutting back on construction.

That means even when sales have slowed further, it's not necessarily going to be easy to find bargains in the housing market. All of that makes for a very challenging outlook for people who want to buy homes as an investment and a source of future wealth.

""Limited housing supply will probably prevent a collapse in prices,"" Kelly said. ""Both today and likely for some years to come, investors might be well advised to buy a home for lifestyle but consider financial assets for investment returns.""

Kelly estimates that in the fourth quarter of this year, housing starts will plunge 28% from a year ago and sales of already-built single-family homes will fall 30%. That's enough to have a noticeable effect on the economy.

""We estimate that the decline in home sales and home building will directly reduce real GDP by 0.6% in the year ended in the fourth quarter of 2022 and 0.2% over the following year,"" he said, adding that will also affect sales of home furnishings and other goods.

That's a problem for an economy that's slowing and might barely avoid a recession next year. Kelly told Insider this month that he thinks there's a 60% chance of a recession in 2023.

""Combined with weakening net exports, continued fiscal drag and growing corporate caution, the housing slump could help tip the economy into recession in 2023,"" he wrote."
3ddcba7d-0d31-4c6e-a515-f0c6035f92fa,"The stock market won't see a sustained rally until the Fed starts to cut interest rates, JPMorgan said.

""As long as central banks raise rates or keep them at current high levels, we believe assets will be rangebound,"" the bank said.

The Fed will need to see a combination of three things to start cutting interest rates, according to JPMorgan.

The stock market won't see a sustained rally until the Federal Reserve begins to cut interest rates, and it has no reason to cut them unless a combination of three factors occurs, JPMorgan said in a Monday note.

The S&P 500 has surged 14% from its mid-October low, but more and more investors are growing increasingly concerned that the jump is nothing more than a bear market rally that will give way to more downside as the Fed gears up for another interest rate hike next month.

""As long as central banks raise rates or keep them at current high levels, we believe assets will be rangebound with a more pronounced downside risk,"" JPMorgan's Marko Kolanovic said.

Instead, the Fed needs to cut interest rates for the stock market to mount a sustained rally that could give way to new highs.

Kolanovic said the Fed could cut rates at some point next year, but only if a combination of factors materializes, including increased unemployment, declining inflation, and ""something breaking in financial markets.""

In its bid to tame elevated inflation, the Fed has already raised rates by 375 basis points so far this year, and it's expected to hike rates by another 50 basis points at its December FOMC meeting. Investors expect a follow-on rate hike of 25 basis points in January, before the Fed ultimately pauses its rate hikes to see where the economy stands.

And a resilient economy means the likelihood of interest rate cuts is far off, according to JPMorgan.

""As an increase in unemployment is not likely to happen very soon, markets will be on edge between waiting for better inflation data, slowing economy and earnings, and rising risks of a financial accident,"" Kolanovic said.

But an economic recession that materializes in late 2023 could be the final straw that causes the Fed to ease financial conditions via interest rate cuts and a pause or reversal in its balance-sheet reduction program.

""We believe the drag from an anticipated 500 basis points Fed tightening will build and last week we incorporated a mild recession into our forecast at the end of next year. However, recessions are disruptive events that normally reflect the interaction of Fed tightening with shocks and the response of a vulnerable private sector. This recipe is not yet in place and it is unlikely that recession will take hold as we turn into the New Year,"" Kolanovic wrote.

Until then, investors shouldn't put too much stock in a stock market rally unless the Fed gives signs that it's going to pivot away from tightening and towards easing financial conditions."

25974f44-f36a-472a-a2b4-664efdd9cdf4,"(Bloomberg) -- Long before Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX cryptocurrency empire collapsed this month, it already was on the radar of federal prosecutors in Manhattan.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, led by Damian Williams, spent several months working on a sweeping examination of crypto currency platforms with US and offshore arms and had started poking into FTX’s massive exchange operations, according to people familiar with the investigation.

The focus was on compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act, the people said. Authorities have used the law, requiring financial institutions take steps to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing, to go after crypto platforms that allegedly falsely claimed that they don’t serve US customers. Bahamas-based FTX operated one of the world’s largest international crypto exchanges, as well as a separate and much more limited venue called FTX US that said it complies with the act.

It’s unclear whether prosecutors in Manhattan reached any conclusion in their probe before FTX -- valued at nearly $32 billion in a January financing -- collapsed, sending the crypto market into a dive and raising questions about the accuracy of its pledges to safeguard customer assets. That put the federal investigation into a new trajectory, the people said.

Representatives for the US attorney’s office and FTX declined to comment.

The months-long sweep shows FTX’s sprawling operations were raising questions even before billions of dollars in financial ties between the exchange operator and Bankman-Fried’s Alameda Research Ltd. investment arm alarmed investors and led his empire to unravel.

Story continues

Prosecutors and regulators including the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission are now seeking help from new FTX Chief Executive Officer John J. Ray III, who took over as part of its bankruptcy proceeding and is navigating what he described as “a complete absence of trustworthy financial information.”

Last week, Ray told the bankruptcy court in a filing that his team had found loans of more than $1 billion made by Alameda to Bankman-Fried and other executives. The filing also alleged software was used to conceal the use of customer funds. Whether any such conduct broke laws will be left to prosecutors. So far, they haven’t accused anyone of wrongdoing.

Long known for its prowess in tackling complex financial crimes, the US attorney’s office in Manhattan has handled the lion’s share of the government’s crypto cases since digital assets came into vogue a decade ago. That includes a half-dozen in the year through October, roughly double the number brought by other Justice Department offices in that period, an analysis of federal dockets shows.

The office benefits from longstanding working relationships between its prosecutors and FBI and SEC investigators, as well as its location in the nation’s largest financial hub. Funds passing through Wall Street, or an email exchange with one of the city’s many firms, can help give prosecutors there an edge in claiming jurisdiction.

Many securities laws were enacted in the 1930s, long before digital currencies came along, forcing investigators to structure their cases with special care, said Samson Enzer, a former prosecutor in SDNY’s Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Force. He worked on the first prosecution tied to an initial coin offering when prosecutors were just starting to question whether securities laws applied to the asset class.

“We had to think a lot of these issues through, and you’re going up against well-resourced defendants,” he said. “You have to consider what arguments they might make. How do we persuade a court?”

Wire fraud

Federal investigators have used a variety of laws to go after crypto platforms.

Southern District prosecutors invoked the Bank Secrecy Act in 2020 against senior employees at the Seychelles-based crypto platform BitMEX, which allegedly allowed more than $209 million of transactions with known dark-net markets. BitMEX argued it didn’t need anti-money laundering or know-your-customer policies in part because it didn’t have US customers and wasn’t registered in the US. But clients circumvented the platform’s attempts to block IP addresses in the US, according to a government sentencing memo filed in federal court.

The loss of customer funds at FTX means authorities will examine whether the exchange misled clients about how their assets would be held, former prosecutors said. To prove wire fraud, investigators would have to show someone at FTX did so for gain using a wire, such as a phone call, email or text.

The FTX bankruptcy case will aid prosecutors in figuring out what documents exist to subpoena. Investigators will also seek communications between employees, whether that’s via email, Slack, Signal or WhatsApp, as well as testimony from witnesses, said Anand Sithian, a former federal prosecutor now at Crowell & Moring.

“What is going to be hard when you issue a subpoena to financial institutions it can take 30, 60, 90, days to process,” Sithian said. “Here if you send a subpoena, I don’t know that the company, FTX, would have that ready. They might need to recreate that.”

The exchange owes about $1.45bn to its top 10 creditors, it said in a court filing over the weekend, without naming them. The largest creditor is owed $226m.

The collapse of FTX rocked the cryptocurrency industry and reduced the paper fortune of its 30-year-old founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, from more than $15bn to almost nothing in a matter of days.

FTX and its affiliates filed for bankruptcy in Delaware on 11 November, leaving an estimated 1 million creditors, although the extent of the losses is not yet fully known because of alleged poor record-keeping. The company said on Saturday that at least 101 companies around the world were part of the bankruptcy proceedings.

The exchange was the second biggest in the world until concerns over its solvency sparked a surge in withdrawals, which exposed that it did not have assets notionally worth billions of dollars that it claimed.

The company, which has been taken over by bankruptcy experts, said on Saturday it had launched a strategic review of its global assets and was preparing for the sale or reorganisation of some businesses, with the investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners hired. A hearing on FTX’s first-day motions is set for Tuesday morning before a US bankruptcy judge, according to a separate court filing.

FTX on Sunday warned that cryptocurrency stolen in the final stages of its collapse was being transferred to other exchanges. The allegedly stolen cryptocurrency was worth $270m on Sunday, according to analysts tracking the transactions. FTX asked other exchanges to help to return the assets to the bankruptcy court.

FTX had gained the backing of prominent investors including venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, and a series of well-known hedge fund managers. It also paid for celebrity endorsements from the likes of the American football star Tom Brady and the comedian Larry David.

The company has appointed as its chief executive John Ray III, a restructuring expert who previously oversaw the bankruptcy of Enron, one of the most notorious and largest corporate frauds in US history. In a filing with the Delaware bankruptcy court, he wrote: “Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here.”

Speaking on Monday, a deputy governor of the Bank of England said the implosion of FTX showed the need to bring crypto within the regulatory framework.

“While the crypto world … is not at present large enough or interconnected enough with mainstream finance to threaten the stability of the financial system, its links with mainstream finance have been developing rapidly,” Jon Cunliffe told a Warwick Business School event.

“We should not wait until it is large and connected to develop the regulatory frameworks necessary to prevent a crypto shock that could have a much greater destabilising impact,” he added."

John Ray III, the new CEO of embattled cryptocurrency platform FTX, labeled the firm's collapse ""unprecedented"" on Thursday.

Ray was appointed CEO last week, after Sam Bankman-Fried gave up control of the company amid its collapse.

A 'complete failure of corporate controls'

""Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here,"" Ray said in a bankruptcy court filing in the US state of Delaware.

Ray has 40 years of experience in the corporate world and oversaw the liquidation of the bankrupt energy firm Enron in 2001. He sharply criticized the leadership style of his predecessor Bankman-Fried and said there was a lack of financial oversight of the company in the Bahamas, where it is headquartered.

""From compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad, to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals, the situation is unprecedented,"" Ray continued.

Ray said corporate funds of the FTX Group were used to buy homes in the Bahamas and other items for employees. He said debtors had managed to secure ""only a fraction"" of digital funds that had been lost amid the bankruptcy process.

Bankman-Fried has denied rumors that he fled the Bahamas for South America Image: Craig Barritt/Getty Images

Bankman-Fried has not yet commented on Ray's allegations in the court filing. Earlier this week, Bankman-Fried spoke to US news outlet Vox via Twitter, where he disparaged regulators and expressed regret about filing bankruptcy.

Thursday's court filing revealed that Bankman-Fried's attorneys and father convinced him to declare bankruptcy. Bankman-Fried's father, Joseph Bankman, is a law professor at Stanford University, where he specializes in tax policy.

What caused FTX's collapse?

FTX's collapse was triggered by reports that Bankman-Fried had used consumer deposits on the platform for trading on his hedge fund, Alameda Research. Crypto outlet Coindesk reported on November 2 that much of Alameda's assets were tied in FTX's signature coin, FTT, raising concerns about the unusually close relationship between the two companies.

The Coindesk report led to unease among investors, with Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao announcing on November 7 that he would sell all of his company's FTT tokens. This sparked a several-day bank run at the company, causing it to fold.

Binance then backed out of a deal to buy FTX, adding to the company's woes.

The liquidity crisis has caused Bankman-Fried's net worth to evaporate. The crypto mogul was worth $23 billion (€22.2 billion) at one point.

FTX had partnerships with Major League Baseball and credit card company Visa.

The controversy has resulted in calls for greater oversight of crypto exchanges. FTX is currently being investigated by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), along with police in the Bahamas.

We’re now around two weeks out from the report that took down FTX, strongly suggesting that its financial foundation was built on a shell game it played with sister-firm Alameda Research using its FTT Token. That news touched off a series of events that led to FTX’s bankruptcy at the end of last week.

This week, other companies are starting to fall, and it may take a long time for them to stop falling. As we have documented in recent years, Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX were among the most prolific investors in crypto companies on the planet. Beyond Bankman-Fried’s status as a “rescuer” of fallen crypto companies like Voyager Digital, he also was an active venture capital and private equity investor.

Consolidation coming

Now, all of those investments are coming unwound. Just this week, after news that the FTX rescue of Voyager has been rendered void, Genesis has stopped withdrawals. After halting withdrawals last week, crypto lender BlockFi appears to be preparing for bankruptcy. These firms are just the tip of the iceberg.

Rather than a period of relative stability, the tide is now going even further out in the crypto universe, and a much smaller cohort of firms are going to emerge unscathed.

What’s worse, with a full bankruptcy impacting such a large, complex firm, the fallout will stretch over a very long period of time, said Daniel Shamah, co-head of the bankruptcy litigation group at international law firm O’Melveny.

“Bankruptcy court is a fishbowl,” said Shamah. “Every decision FTX made in recent weeks will be highly scrutinized by a litany of players – committees, potentially an examiner or a trustee, other investors – with a range of tools at their disposal. Expect this to be a long, expensive process that will take years to play out.”

Mud on a trusted face

Even worse is the loss of trust in FTX and Bankman-Fried, who were seen by some as reliable and stable entities, if not out-and-out saviors of the crypto space. FTX and its founder were among the most recognizable and outspoken faces in the industry.

What advisors and clients need now from the digital assets space is a trusted partner, someone they can work with. Crypto exchanges will need to diversify their revenue streams to create more stability during crypto downturns, according to Suneet Muru, an analyst on the thematic intelligence team at GlobalData. This demand for more diversification puts pressure on young, technology-driven companies, many of which are still trying to define, develop and scale their businesses.

“FTX’s bankruptcy will be a classic example of ‘short-term pain, long-term gain’. It will deflate the crypto market cap over the next few months, but will force exchanges to realign their business models toward effective risk management. Now more than ever, exchanges must demonstrate how they differ from banks and keep far less of their own cryptocurrencies on their books.”

Warning signs were there

Not everyone trusted FTX. Digital Asset Research, a provider of institutional data, insights and research for the crypto space, never passed FTX as a “vetted” exchange and never placed it on its own list of trusted actors.

Some of the reasons FTX failed to pass DAR’s muster included opacity, weak KYC/AML controls and its unusual relationship with Alameda research.

LevelField Financial CEO and founder Gene Grant was also wary of FTX long before the CoinDesk report.

“The yellow caution lights were flashing for FTX for some time,” said Grant. “The world loved the story of a brash young man taking on the world, building an empire, and creating a firm from nothing. The problem is that financial services companies are not the same as other companies, and the qualities that make a great leader are those that are less flashy: trustfulness, safety and risk mitigation.”

While much of the world was enthralled by Bankman-Fried's ability to move billions to fund and bailout others in the digital assets space, Grant was concerned with FTX’s origin story, which had its roots in a quasi-illegal arbitrage crypto trade in South Korea, and that Alameda Research was purportedly named under false pretenses to secure bank accounts for the company.

Sam Bankman-Fried surely isn’t the only person in the crypto universe who has built a mostly positive reputation by playing it loose with regulators. While many in the financial services industry scoff at the stringent regulations placed upon them by state, federal and industry agencies, failure to follow those rules should be taken as a huge red flag in and of itself.

A company that plays it fast and loose with regulators may be willing to do the same with investor money."

“From compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad, to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals, this situation is unprecedented,” he added.

Alameda Research, the trading arm of Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto empire, loaned him and other companies under his control $3.3 billion, according to documents filed as part of FTX's bankruptcy proceedings.

A loan of $1 billion went directly to Bankman-Fried, the filing said, while $2.3 billion went to Paper Bird Inc., which he owns a majority stake in. Other employees at FTX also received loans from Alameda, including $543 million to head of engineering Nishad Singh and $55 million to head of FTX digital markets Ryan Salame.

The bankruptcy filing included numerous stunning revelations about FTX. The new chief executive, who oversaw the liquidation of scandal-ridden Enron, said he was stunned by the mishandling of corporate finances. FTX under Bankman-Fried's leadership kept little to no records, and it was warned in the filing that any financial statements made previously cannot be relied on.

Cash flows from Alameda to other ventures controlled by Bankman-Fried is the central focus of allegations of mishandling customer funds. FTX CEO John J. Ray III said in the bankruptcy filing that ""never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here."""
4a4ea6bc-7275-4839-976f-0ea4bb88f733,"A new bankruptcy filing, first reported by CNBC, shows that FTX’s corporate funds were used to purchase homes in the Bahamas among other personal items. The details arise less than a week after the now infamous crypto exchange filed for bankruptcy — a decision that founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried said he regrets.

FTX’s new CEO, Enron wind-down veteran John J. Ray III, said in the filing that he never in his career had “seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here.”

“From compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad, to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals, this situation is unprecedented,” Ray said in the filing.

The document states that corporate funds of the FTX group were used to purchase homes and other personal items for employees and advisers. Ray added that “certain real estate” was recorded in the personal names of employees and advisrrs, and “there does not appear to be documentation for certain of these transactions as loans.”

The newly installed chief executive makes it clear that he’s not blaming all FTX employees for the potential mishandling of funds. “Although the investigation has only begun and must run its course, it is my view based on the information obtained to date, that many of the employees of the FTX Group, including some of its senior executives, were not aware of the shortfalls or potential commingling digital assets.” If that possible lack of blame extends to the real estate transactions is not clear.

He adds that current and former employees are some of the people most hurt by FTX, and that “these are many of the same people whose work will be necessary to ensure the maximization of value for all stakeholders going forward.”

FTX’s downfall began last week after Binance backed out of a deal to acquire the crypto exchange as a result of a due diligence process. News reports that FTX was mishandling funds and under investigation soon bloomed into the company filing for bankruptcy.

Story continues

Bankman-Fried, meanwhile, claims that he is still hoping to raise an $8 billion lifeline for the company.

“Everyone goes around pretending that perception reflects reality, it doesn’t,” Bankman-Fried said in a Twitter conversation with Vox reporter Kelsey Piper earlier this week. “Some of this decade’s greatest heroes will never be known, and some of its most beloved people are basically shams.”"
b8c7b661-59b2-4088-9736-1484cc017d20,"Missing Money, Crypto Houses, and Emoji Payments: Here’s the Most Batshit Revelations From FTX’s Latest Bankruptcy Filing

Once upon a time, the cryptocurrency exchange FTX was a jewel of the web3 world. Now, in the span of a week, its reputation has transformed from shooting star to sinking ship. After admitting to mismanaging large amounts of customer money, the exchange’s founder and CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried (also known by his initials “SBF”) ignominiously stepped down, and the company filed for bankruptcy. Now, as the dust settles and the air clears, the adults in the room are trying to pick up the pieces and figure out just how screwed the company and all its investors are.

A recent bankruptcy filing, revealed Thursday by the exchange’s new CEO, John Ray III, may help with that. While the document provides additional context on what’s been happening with the imploding exchange it also provides some entertainment because, whoo boy, it is totally insane.

The filing reveals the inner workings (or lack there of) of the exchange, giving a peek into the bizarre financial practices and decision making that went on under SBF’s leadership. For a company that was once considered to be the rising star (and potential saviour) of the crypto industry, FTX apparently ran itself like a ship of drunken sailors, foregoing common and established record-keeping practices and engaging in a slew of shady and ill-advised behaviour.

“Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here,” wrote Ray in his filing. “This situation is unprecedented.”

That’s truly saying something, given the fact that Ray presided over the restructuring of Enron, after the financial giant famously caved in on itself from corruption in the mid-2000s.

Keep that in mind as you peruse the biggest revelations from FTX’s court filing.

The New CEO Has “No Confidence” in FTX’s Balance Sheets

One of the starkest examples of how crazy the financial situation at FTX was is that Ray apparently thinks the FTX books might be…uh, not quite accurate, to put it kindly. Over and over again throughout the filing, Ray gives a brief rundown of what the company claimed to have in assets at one point or another, before ultimately appending a statement like this:

To my knowledge, none of these financial statements have been audited. Because these balance sheets were unaudited…I do not have confidence in them, and the information therein may not be correct as of the date stated.

According to Ray, the company’s financial records just aren’t trustworthy and it’s not clear whether they contain accurate information or not.

Most of the Company’s Money is Still MIA

What’s worse than not keeping an accurate record of how much money you have? Having most of your money disappear. That is, according to Ray, most of the money that the company was supposed to have just hasn’t been located yet. Ray writes that he has “located and secured only a fraction of the digital assets” that were supposed to have been held by the company.

In other words, a whole lot of money is missing. Part of this is because the company was hacked right after it went bankrupt, allegedly leading to hundreds of millions of dollars in assets being stolen. But FTX was supposedly worth tens of billions of dollars. While it’s still early days, you’d think that all you’d have to do is open up the cold storage and it would be there, right? Instead, we apparently don’t know where most of it is.

FTX Employees Bought Houses with Company Funds

What do you do when you have way too much money? Apparently just start buying properties with company funds. The filing states that FTX employees bought multiple properties using corporate money. Ray writes:

In the Bahamas, I understand that corporate funds of the FTX Group were used to purchase homes and other personal items for employees and advisors. I understand that there does not appear to be documentation for certain of these transactions as loans, and that certain real estate was recorded in the personal name of these employees and advisors on the records of the Bahamas.

Alameda Research Gave Out Billions in Loans to SBF, Others

Photo: Craig Barritt, Getty Images

Alameda Research, the hedge fund set up by SBF that secretly shared much of the money from FTX, gave out billions of dollars in loans — including to SBF himself. The bankruptcy filing from Thursday notes that many of those loans are now outstanding. In one case, the document notes “one [loan was given] to Mr. Bankman-Fried, of $US1 ($1) billion.” Another loan of $US543 ($754) million was given out to the Nishad Singh, the co-founder of FTX.

Staff Used Self-Deleting Messages to Discuss Decisions

Photo: Tero Vesalainen, Shutterstock

FTX apparently kept very few records of internal communications and, thus, the paper trail that would’ve helped explain what the company was doing and why is quite thin. Instead, most of the employees appear to have communicated via chat applications that were programmed to auto-delete. Ray writes:

One of the most pervasive failures of the FTX.com business in particular is the absence of lasting records of decision-making. Mr. Bankman-Fried often communicated by using applications that were set to auto-delete after a short period of time, and encouraged employees to do the same…

Not sketchy at all!

The Company Had No Cash Management System

Photo: VIKTORIUS-73, Getty Images

For most companies, a money management system is a pretty typical thing to have. They’re useful for tracking corporate cash flows — helping record the details for everybody the company is paying, how much it’s paying them, when, why — that sort of thing. According to the recent bankruptcy filing, however, FTX just really did not try to do any of that stuff. I guess when you have an ungodly amount of money the attitude might be, ehhhh, do we really need to write all this down? The bankruptcy filing reads:

The FTX Group did not maintain centralised control of its cash. Cash management procedural failures included the absence of an accurate list of bank accounts and account signatories, as well as insufficient attention to the creditworthiness of banking partners…

Nice!

Employees Filed for Reimbursement with Emojis

The filing also shares that, under SBF, the company submitted and fulfilled payment requests through a chat application and disbursements were approved with personalised emojis. That’s not exactly standard procedure and Ray writes that FTX did not “have the type of disbursement controls that I believe are appropriate for a business enterprise.”

FTX Didn’t Keep Track of Who Its Employees Were

Among a whole bunch of other things that the company didn’t bother to keep track of, FTX apparently did spend much time keeping track of who was employed with the company. Ray writes that, thus far, the company has been:

“…unable to prepare a complete list of who worked for the FTX Group as of the Petition Date, or the terms of their employment. Repeated attempts to locate certain presumed employees to confirm their status have been unsuccessful to date.”

Crypto Deposited by Customers Wasn’t Recorded on the Balance Sheet and the Company Doesn’t Even Know Who Its Top 50 Creditors Are

Photo: WHYFRAME, Shutterstock

FTX took in a helluva lot of money from crypto depositors over its run, but apparently it didn’t spend any time keeping track of who deposited what. The bankruptcy filing reveals that “balances of customer crypto assets deposited were not recorded as assets on the balance sheet and are not presented,” which seems to imply that the company has no idea how to account for those deposits. Of this news, financial industry analyst Genevieve Roch-Decter writes: “Crypto deposited by customers weren’t even recorded on the balance sheet. Presumably, all crypto assets just went into one central slush fund used for whatever.”

To top it all off, the filing reveals that FTX also has no idea who its top 50 creditors are. In short, the company doesn’t seem to know much of anything."
bb3b6d88-4ef3-46cb-b0df-ae21721e813c,"The Guy in Charge of FTX Bankruptcy Calls Crypto Company ‘A Complete Failure’ of Corporate Controls

Just how bad do you have to be for a 40-year veteran of corporate undoings to call you one of the most faulty, most compromised entities he’s ever seen? John J. Ray III was tapped to handle the chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings of FTX’s multiple major corporate entities. In his latest bankruptcy filing released Thursday, Ray noted that in his 40 years of legal and restructuring experience:

“Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here.”

He cited the companies’ failed system integrity and faulty regulatory oversight. He also noted that FTX had concentrated company control “in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals.”

It’s unclear exactly whom he’s calling “potentially compromised,” but the buck might very well stop at former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. The once-leader in the crypto space has remained out of arms reach in the Bahamas, where his many company holdings were based out of. All the while he’s been trying to somehow repair his image by claiming he’s working hard to reclaim the millions of dollars of users’ funds that were locked in their exchange accounts.

Many of Bankman-Fried’s crypto-centric businesses were under the umbrella of the West Realm Shires, which included FTX US and other U.S.-centric entities. The once-CEO’s crypto hedge funds were led by Alameda Research but that so-called “silo” of corporate entities also included several investment entities. According to Ray, both were essentially controlled by Bankman-Fried with minority interests by FTX co-founder Zixiao “Gary” Wang and director of engineering Nishad Singh.

The latest reports coming out of the FTX debacle have noted Bankman-Fried, who often goes by SBF, had created backchannels that allowed him to secretly funnel $US10 ($14) billion of customer funds from FTX to Alameda, even though they were meant to be separate entities. Previous bankruptcy documents said there could be somewhere around 1 million creditors looking to make something back from this mess.

Ray is a veteran of major corporate bankruptcies and restructurings. As mentioned in a Tuesday Wall Street Journal bio, he handled Fruit of the Loom’s 1999 bankruptcy, but his biggest claim to fame was working through the Enron debacle, recovering billions for creditors from the dungheap of corporate fraud that was the former energy company.

But in an interview with Vox’s Kelsey Piper conducted Nov. 13 and published Wednesday, SBF said he regretted agreeing to bankruptcy in the first place. According to his own words provided verbatim via Twitter DM screenshots, Bankman-Fried argued that he would have been able to right the ship if he still had his hands on the controls, somehow claiming “everything would be ~70% fixed right now” and that “withdrawals would be opening up in a month with customers fully whole.”

He even implied he was pushed toward bankruptcy from Wang and Singh because they were both afraid and feeling “ashamed and guilty.”

That Vox interview makes SBF, the once-herald of “effective altruism,” sound even more like a sociopath who had no idea how poorly he had managed his companies. A handy chart created by Molly White of Web3 is Going Just Great fame shows just how deep the contagion between the FTX fallout had been with other crypto companies. Earlier this week, digital asset lender BlockFi announced it may declare bankruptcy, and on Wednesday crypto lender Genesis and the crypto platform Gemini both halted withdrawals. It’s an open question whether the FTX fallout could sink even more of the crypto economy."

FTX Group has a big hole to fill as it looks for funds to repay customers and creditors during its bankruptcy.

According to a new Chapter 11 filing, recently installed CEO John Ray has been combing through Sam Bankman-Fried's multitude of businesses and divided them into four groups, or silos: WRS, Alameda, Ventures and Dotcom.

""The Debtors have located and secured only a fraction of the digital assets of the FTX Group that they hope to recover in these Chapter 11 Cases,"" the filing said. ""The Debtors have secured in new cold wallets approximately $740 million of cryptocurrency that the Debtors believe is attributable to either the WRS, Alameda and/or Dotcom Silos.""

The $740 million in cryptocurrency doesn't include at least $372 million of unauthorized transfers nor approximately $300 million in FTT tokens minted by an unauthorized source after the bankruptcy filing.

The asset picture looked much different before FTX's collapse.

Elsewhere in the filing, assets across the four silos showed ""crypto assets held at fair value"" totaled more than $4 billion as of September 30. In addition, US dollar-denominated stablecoins totaled more than $1.1 billion across the silos.

Meanwhile, founder Bankman-Fried, who resigned as CEO last week, previously has said the company held $5.5 billion in ""less liquid"" crypto tokens.

The filing gives perhaps the most comprehensive view yet of FTX since the exchange's downfall, amid federal probes over potential mishandling of client funds.

Still, it noted that ""the main companies in the Alameda Silo and the Ventures Silo did not keep complete books and records of their investments and activities,"" and Ray cautioned throughout that he doesn't have confidence in FTX's numbers, which may not be correct."

The names, addresses and other information about the claims was redacted by the court.

Bahamas-based FTX filed for bankruptcy on November 11 after the exchange acknowledged that it had used customer funds to cover bad bets by Bankman-Fried's trading arm, Alameda Research.

Since it went into bankruptcy, the lawyers tasked with sorting through the aftermath have described in court filings a company that had little risk controls and would use company funds to pay for personal purchases of its employees.

While there they spotted an opportunity to make money selling tickets to boat parties. The pair earned a 10 Euro commission for every ticket they sold.

With no set wage or guaranteed income it motivated the pair to go out there and work endlessly as their earning potential was uncapped. And the rewards were such that the pair decided to return the following year.

Jack said: ""When we came back to the role the following year, we decided to put posters up around the area, offering ticket-selling jobs to new workers. We explained the role, interviewed and trained them and offered them five Euros for every ticket sold.

""The commission was 10 Euros, but as we were offering training and giving them tips on where it was best to sell, we kept five Euros for every ticket sold by all our team members. Looking back, this was surreal as we had up to 15 people coming to our daily meetings, some of them 10 years older than us, and we were earning five Euros for every ticket they sold without us having to go and do the work ourselves. We didn't really do anything special, we just had the courage to take a risk and give it a go!’

The side hustle was just the first of Jack's money-making moves which have seen him go from those early commissions through to running a £1m business in Billingham. And as today's cost of living crisis is putting more and more households under financial stress he is now offering his tips on how to boost incomes.

‘Side hustle’ has become a household term these days, with many people trying to launch their own source of secondary income to help make ends meet. Google searches for ‘side hustle’ have increased by 58% in the last year, and with the Bank of England reporting that the UK is heading towards a massive recession, the desire to build multiple revenue streams isn’t going to go down any time soon.

Jack, Co-Founder of luxury loungewear brand Snuggy, told how he experimented with a range of successful side hustles and businesses before finding major success with the hooded blankets which are keeping Brits warm over the winter. He shared his story with money-saving community LatestDeals.co.uk.

He told how he had worked in a range of areas before Snuggy. He said: ""I owned an events hire company, a car air freshener brand and more recently, I was part of a hot tub company that built high-quality spas in customers' gardens. This was something no one in Europe was offering at the time.

""I have always been focused on making money. I had a paper round from the age of 11 up until I was about 14. I used to get up every morning at 6am and ride 10 miles on my bike, delivering papers for an hour, to earn just £12 a week. I genuinely believe having that sort of work ethic from such an early age is so valuable.

""I could make a long list of side hustles that I did when I was young. Some of them got me banned from eBay and other selling platforms! They aren't things I brag about or particularly like speaking about, but the goal was always the same, to make extra money.""

Jack’s Top 5 Questions To Ask When Evaluating A Product 1. Who is my customer? Who do I think will be most likely to buy this product and why? 2. Can I offer something different from the competition? Maybe undercut them on price, make the product bigger or thicker, or add an element to it? 3. Is there room for me to make healthy profit margins after factoring in all costs? Try to at least double your money. 4. Am I going to be breaking any laws regarding trademark infringement or design rights to another company? 5. Can I expand on this product to introduce other relevant products further down the line?

Jack, who runs Snuggy with his friend Joel and Joel's dad John, shares a good starting point for those wanting to explore making money online: ‘Alibaba is my go-to for starting any business or side hustle. It’s great to browse even if you don’t have an idea yet. For anyone that doesn't know what this is, it's a wholesale platform that you can browse through to find products to buy in small or large quantities. You contact the manufacturers directly and speak to them about prices, minimum order quantities, packaging, shipping, etc.

""If you can find a product that is selling well in the UK and also find a supplier who can provide it at a competitive price, then take a punt, try and negotiate a low minimum order quantity to start with so you minimize the financial risk & place an order. There are pages and pages of “trending products” on the site that you can search through and give yourself some inspiration from. Once you have an idea, get chatting with a couple of the manufacturers & don’t be afraid to ask lots of questions.

""In the early stages of sourcing products from Alibaba, I always used to look for small ones that I thought would sell well and wouldn’t cost a lot to ship from China. The shipping and freight side of it can often put people off as it’s a bit of an unknown territory. However, really small products can give you a bit more flexibility in using air freight, sea freight or even railway.

""Finding a good product to sell on eBay or Amazon without being flooded out with competition can take a while. I would look for a 'best-selling' product or a product with a lot of reviews. Have a look at the negative reviews on the product and take those points into account when launching the same product. You don't have to invent something new; just focus on improving something old.

""Amazon and eBay are great marketplaces to test if a product will sell or not. It is a lot easier to start there as opposed to starting a brand and trying to bring in your customers through advertising.""

(Image: LatestDeals.co.uk)

Jack shared his tips for those who are beginning to think about side hustles alongside their 9-5: ""Start local - find a service or a product that might be of interest to your local area and make it something that you can do on a weekend or for a couple of hours after work.

""It doesn't have to be something you are passionate about, it can be anything - making cakes, jet-washing driveways, dog walking and so on. This starting point will give you an understanding of how to treat customers, gain sales and earn money outside of your 9-5. Use social media to comment, like, message people and generate interest in what you are doing; it's free!

""Another tip would be, do not worry about what people might think. The biggest barrier people face when starting a business or side hustle for the first time is: 'Oh, I wonder what they will think about me if I do that, what if it fails’ and so on.

Jack Griffiths, is the co-Founder of the luxury loungewear company Snuggy, which is making a whopping £1 million a year.

But the savvy side hustler experimented with a range of successful side hustles and businesses before finding major success with the hooded blankets.

Now he has shared his top tips and tricks for those wanting to make money online.

Jack told LatestDeals.co.uk: “I have been working solely on Snuggy for the last three years, and all of my time is dedicated to growing this brand.

“For anyone thinking about getting involved in business, the story of Snuggy shows what taking a risk can do for you.

“When we started the business, we had no plan or long-term goals. We wanted to make some quick money over winter. Within the first few weeks, we sold a shedload of products, much to our surprise.

“What’s more, our customers wanted to know where to get more, if they could get them in different colours, and so on. It kept on snowballing, and we quickly realised we had a good opportunity to run with the wind and grow something big.

But it hasn’t always been smooth-sailing for Jack - he has always been focused on making money and has explored a variety of different side hustles in his time.

He explained: “When my friend Joel and I were 18, we went on holiday to Magaluf and saw an opportunity to make money selling tickets to boat parties.

“We found a way to take advantage of the way the process worked. We earned a 10 Euro commission for every ticket we sold, and there was no set wage or guaranteed income.

“As you get paid according to what you earn, we were motivated to go out there and work endlessly as our earning potential was uncapped.

“When we came back to the role the following year, we decided to put posters up around the area, offering ticket-selling jobs to new workers. We explained the role, interviewed and trained them and offered them 5 Euros for every ticket sold.

“The commission was 10 Euros, but as we were offering training and giving them tips on where it was best to sell, we kept 5 Euros for every ticket sold by all our team members.

“Looking back, this was surreal as we had up to 15 people coming to our daily meetings, some of them 10 years older than us, and we were earning 5 Euros for every ticket they sold without us having to go and do the work ourselves.

""We didn't really do anything special, we just had the courage to take a risk and give it a go!”

I have always been focused on making money.

But ticket selling isn’t the only business Jack has been involved in, as he continued: “I owned an events hire company, a car air freshener brand and more recently, I was part of a hot tub company that built high-quality spas in customers' gardens. This was something no one in Europe was offering at the time.

“I have always been focused on making money. I had a paper round from the age of 11 up until I was about 14. I used to get up every morning at 6 am and ride 10 miles on my bike, delivering papers for an hour, to earn just £12 a WEEK.

""I genuinely believe having that sort of work ethic from such an early age is so valuable. I could make a long list of side hustles that I did when I was young”.

If you are looking to start your own online side hustle and aren’t sure where to start, Jack has shared his top tips.

He added: “Alibaba is my go-to for starting any business or side hustle. It’s great to browse even if you don’t have an idea yet. For anyone that doesn't know what this is, it's a wholesale platform that you can browse through to find products to buy in small or large quantities. You contact the manufacturers directly and speak to them about prices, minimum order quantities, packaging, shipping, etc.

“If you can find a product that is selling well in the UK and also find a supplier who can provide it at a competitive price, then take a punt, try and negotiate a low minimum order quantity to start with so you minimise the financial risk & place an order.

You do not need to jump ship completely and quit your job straight away.

“There are pages and pages of “trending products” on the site that you can search through and give yourself some inspiration from. Once you have an idea, get chatting with a couple of the manufacturers & don’t be afraid to ask lots of questions.

“In the early stages of sourcing products from Alibaba, I always used to look for small ones that I thought would sell well and wouldn’t cost a lot to ship from China. The shipping and freight side of it can often put people off as it’s a bit of an unknown territory. However, really small products can give you a bit more flexibility in using air freight, sea freight or even railway.

“Finding a good product to sell on eBay or Amazon without being flooded out with competition can take a while. I would look for a 'best-selling' product or a product with a lot of reviews.

“Have a look at the negative reviews on the product and take those points into account when launching the same product. You don't have to invent something new; just focus on improving something old.

“Amazon and eBay are great marketplaces to test if a product will sell or not; it is a lot easier to start there as opposed to starting a brand and trying to bring in your customers through advertising”.

If you are someone that doesn’t want to take the plunge and quit your day job, but are wanting to start a side hustle in your spare time, Jack has shared his top tips.

He advised: “Start local - find a service or a product that might be of interest to your local area and make it something that you can do on a weekend or for a couple of hours after work. It doesn't have to be something you are passionate about, it can be anything - making cakes, jet-washing driveways, dog walking and so on.

“This starting point will give you an understanding of how to treat customers, gain sales and earn money outside of your 9-5. Use social media to comment, like, message people and generate interest in what you are doing; it's FREE!

“Another tip would be, DO NOT worry about what people might think. The biggest barrier people face when starting a business or side hustle for the first time is: 'Oh, I wonder what they will think about me if I do that, what if it fails’ and so on. If you stay in your head, you’ll never get anywhere.

“Limit the risks where possible - if you have an idea for a business, but you are putting it off because you have a full-time secure job, get started on your idea in your spare time. You do not need to jump ship completely and quit your job straight away.

“Start your business as a side hustle; just get started in your spare time. You only need to decide whether to quit your job when business is going so well that you run out of time and it makes sense financially.

“Be prepared to sacrifice parts of your social life to start a side hustle. The saying goes, 'If it was easy, everyone would be doing it'. Most people don't want to make the sacrifices needed to pursue a better lifestyle”."

He told news.com.au: ""I got quite fortunate, then that allowed me the financial freedom to start developing products without that risk.""

His business ideas - including a door stop firm and an automated CD generator - did not come with the success he had hoped for, however.

But after a string of disasters, Mr Sellar, 39, got lucky when he noticed people at the beach trying to cover their faces with t-shirts.

It inspired him to crate a tent-like face shield made a reflective material, able to fold down and be put in a bag.

He launched the product, Shader, in 2018 and at first thought the idea was a fail too.

Mr Sellar said: ""It started really slow. The first week we barely sold any – we thought this wasn’t working.

“Then all of a sudden it went absolutely crazy.”

The product started being shared on Facebook and became popular - until the pandemic hit and people stopped going outside.

But as Mr Sellar's original product was made of wood, he decided to use the pandemic to have a rethink.

He created a version that was lightweight, sleek and easy to carry.

It meant transportation costs were lowered too - and after restrictions lifted businesses started to boom again.

He now rakes in £28,000 every week and hopes to launch the product in the US next year.

b074b52b-5695-4935-a09e-38c616aac601,"Silvergate Capital (SI) shares fell Friday morning in a sign that FTX’s rapid unraveling continues to rattle investors.

On Thursday, Silvergate CEO Alan Lane tried to assuage investors that market volatility precipitated by FTX’s collapse would not affect the crypto banker’s business.

“Suffice it to say, whether deposits are up or down, we have the liquidity and the capital ratios to support the volatility,” said Lane at the Oppenheimer Blockchain & Digital Assets Summit.

But his message seemed to fall flat as the company’s stock price fell almost 10% on Friday. More broadly, shares of Silvergate Capital have nosedived 85% since last year’s crypto bull run.

Hours after Lane’s remarks, crypto prime brokerage FalconX announced it would not be using Silvergate SEN Leverage, which enables institutional investors to trade any asset on-platform with leverage collateralized by bitcoin or U.S. dollars, “out of an abundance of caution.” It will also not be using the crypto banker to make wire transfers.

Last Friday, Silvergate announced that it has no outstanding loans or investments to FTX and clarified that FTX is not a custodian for any of its bitcoin-collateralized SEN Leverage loans. FTX does have at least $1 billion in deposits with Silvergate, but the bank says that represents less than 10% of its total deposits from all digital asset customers.

Both institutional and retail investors have been on edge since FTX’s collapse as they attempt to anticipate the effects of a third market-disrupting contagion on the crypto market and the crypto industry at large. The first two contagions were precipitated by the Terra-Luna collapse, in May, and Three Arrow Capital’s implosion, in June, respectively.

Marc Cohodes, an early critic of FTX, says FTX’s deposits with Silvergate are still a sizable percentage of the banker’s overall deposit base. On Tuesday, Cohodes told Hedgeye that he’s shorting Silvergate, noting the size of FTX’s deposits with the bank is a huge red flag.

dd7d00ee-1b23-40b3-abab-e91fa016e87c,"Summary Hunt says tax rises, spending curbs needed to fight inflation

""I have tried to avoid anything that damages long-term growth""

But little in budget to help growth in short term

UK only G7 economy yet to recover pre-pandemic size

Tough reforms needed to speed up growth - IFS















LONDON, Nov 18 (Reuters) - British finance minister Jeremy Hunt says higher taxes and curbs on spending are the price that must be paid to allow the economy to grow in future, but his new budget offers little immediate help to the businesses that must lead any recovery.

Hunt, reminding lawmakers of his own past as an entrepreneur in marketing and publishing, made accelerating economic growth a priority in his budget speech to parliament on Thursday.

But most of his measures - ranging from heftier social security and value-added tax bills for employers, windfall taxes on energy firms and fewer incentives for research and development - are likely to do the opposite, at least for now,

And Hunt and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had already told businesses they will face a hefty increase in tax on their profits from April.

Britain is badly in need of a growth fillip. It is the only Group of Seven economy yet to recover its pre-COVID size as it struggles with one of the highest inflation rates among rich countries, a shortage of workers, and barriers to trade with the European Union thrown up by Brexit.

In media interviews on Friday, Hunt dismissed criticism - some of it from within his own Conservative Party - that he was smothering growth, saying the expected hit to Britain's economy was less severe than the slowdown forecast for Germany.

He highlighted higher spending on education and his plan to build on Britain's highly ranked universities and its track record in innovation to foster a new Silicon Valley.

""This is an amazing country with extraordinary prospects and we're going to grip those prospects and make sure that in the medium term and the longer term this really does become the most prosperous and successful country in Europe,"" he told BBC radio.

But the journey is likely to be tough for British businesses.

The Office for Budget Responsibility, which provides the forecasts that underpin the government's budgets, said on Thursday it estimated the economy was already in recession and would shrink by 1.4% in 2023.

It also cut its growth forecast for 2024 to 1.3% before a better couple of years thereafter with growth at 2.6% and 2.7%.

The OBR said the 6-percentage-point rise in the corporate tax rate from April would hit investment, lowering the potential output of Britain's economy by 0.2% at the end of its five-year forecast period, and a bit more after that.

It said Hunt's plan to cut public investment from 2024 would probably weigh on productivity growth - key to an economy's long-term prospects - beyond its five-year forecasts.

SLOW GROWTH

Britain's medium-term sustainable growth rate is just 1.75%, the OBR estimated. That was unchanged from March, but now relies more on immigration - a sensitive topic for some voters - and less on business investment, with productivity also weaker.

Recession, higher interest rates, energy prices and taxation would combine to stifle investment, the OBR said.

The Confederation of British Industry, representing employers, welcomed a freeze in the business rates tax on commercial properties and the government's decision to stick with major infrastructure projects in nuclear power and rail.

But a freeze in the threshold for paying social security contributions for staff and the windfall taxes were ""the sharpest stings in the tail,"" the CBI's chief economist, Rain Newton-Smith, said.

""Businesses will think there's more to be done on growth,"" she said.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank advocates reforms to free up Britain's glacial system for construction permits and improve vocational and further education, and a redesign of business taxes to promote investment.

""Doing them isn't easy, though. There are reasons why previous governments have shied away,"" IFS Deputy Director Carl Emmerson said, adding that the full pay-off in areas like education would take decades.

Pressed on Friday about the slow growth outlook, including the impact of Brexit, Hunt said he was confident that frictions to trade with the EU would be fixed.

""I have tried to avoid anything that damages long-term growth,"" Hunt told the BBC.

For some analysts, there are still big questions about how he will boost growth beyond hastening a decline in inflation, which threatens to hit Britons with the biggest falls on record in their living standards this year and next.

J.P. Morgan economist Allan Monks said the OBR's lowered expectations for future productivity improvements were still higher than anything seen sustainably in Britain for 14 years and its forecasts for population growth also looked ambitious.

""The hope is that some good news turns up on growth and means that part of the planned fiscal consolidation will not need to happen,"" Monks said in an email to clients.

""This is certainly possible, for example if gas prices dropped more quickly than expected. But the OBR's longer-term forecasts still strike us as optimistic.""

LONDON, Nov 18 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund's managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, said she had spoken with British finance minister Jeremy Hunt on Friday to welcome his latest plan for 55 billion pounds ($65 billion) of budget tightening.

""It strikes the right balance between fiscal responsibility and protecting growth and vulnerable households,"" Georgieva said in a brief statement on social media.

The IMF had criticised Hunt's predecessor, Kwasi Kwarteng, for previous budget plans in September which included 45 billion pounds of unfunded tax cuts.

Those plans led to market turmoil, pushing sterling to a record low against the U.S. dollar, forcing the BoE to intervene in the bond market and ultimately costing the job of the British prime minister at the time, Liz Truss.

Georgieva said Hunt's proposals - which see taxes rising almost immediately, but delay most spending cuts until after 2024 - were an appropriate response at a time when the economy faced a challenging situation.

""In a call with Chancellor Hunt today, I welcomed (Britain's) Autumn Statement prepared at a difficult time for the UK economy, against strong global headwinds,"" she said.

British inflation is at a 41-year high of 11.1%, and its Office for Budget Responsibility estimates the economy is now in recession and that households this year will suffer their biggest drop in real incomes since records began in the 1950s.

Hunt's plan represents tax rises and spending cuts equivalent to 2% of gross domestic product by the 2027-28 financial year.

LONDON (AP) — Britain’s Conservative government on Friday defended its decision to hike taxes for millions of working people in the “squeezed middle” class as it tries to shore up an economy battered by double-digit inflation and the reckless tax-cutting of recently ousted Prime Minister Liz Truss.

An emergency budget announced by Treasury chief Jeremy Hunt on Thursday includes 25 billion pounds ($30 billion) in tax hikes, including higher income tax for middle and top earners and steeper local household taxes. The Treasury acknowledged that the moves will take taxes as a share of national income to its highest level since World War II.

The combination of high inflation – predicted to be 9.1% for 2022, largely driven by soaring energy costs from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – and stagnating salaries means a 7% decline in U.K. living standards over the next two years, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government’s fiscal watchdog.

“The truth is, we just got a lot poorer,” Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said.

“We’re in for a long, hard, unpleasant journey,” he added, with “high borrowing, high debt, high tax and public spending under strain.”

Hunt reversed the billions of pounds in unfunded tax cuts announced by his predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng less than two months ago – a package that spooked financial markets, sent the pound plunging to a record low against the U.S. dollar and forced emergency intervention from the Bank of England.

Hunt also renounced the central principle touted by Kwarteng and Truss: that lower taxes are the key to economic growth.

“Sound money matters more than low taxes,” he said. “None of this is easy, but it’s the right thing to do.”

The emergency budget largely postponed public spending cuts until 2025 – after the next national election — and promised more money for key areas including education and health. Hunt also included help for British society’s most vulnerable, raising pensions and welfare benefits in line with inflation and boosting the minimum wage by 9.7%.

But millions of people in the U.K. face higher energy bills in the spring, when the government plans to cut back on support that has capped the average household’s utility bill at 2,500 pounds ($3,000) a year – more than double what it was a year ago. Bills are expected to increase to 3,000 pounds ($3,575) a year on average.

Hunt said the steps he was taking meant a predicted recession would be “shallower” than it otherwise would have been.

But some Conservatives grumbled that Hunt was abandoning the right-of-center party’s longstanding commitment to low taxes. And Friday’s headlines made bleak reading. “Carnage” was the Daily Mirror’s front-page verdict. The Metro blared “You’ve never had it so bad,” while the generally Conservative-supporting Daily Mail said accusingly: “Tories soak the strivers.”

Consumer affairs expert Martin Lewis said the worst is still to come for many people.

“Next spring, we are going to have this perfect storm of energy bills going up, cost of living continuing to rise and energy bills at their peak,” Lewis told radio station LBC. “My concern is what do we do to get people over that hump.”

Some Britons are worried but willing to give Hunt and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak – who took office last month after Truss was forced to resign over her botched budget – the benefit of the doubt.

“Things seem a lot calmer,” London resident Jo Thornton said. “I mean, it couldn’t have got any worse. So, fingers crossed. Rishi has my backing, I think he’s doing a good job. So, yeah, I wish him luck.”"

8579ac3d-2018-4ab7-8295-b343d08cd6ab,"LONDON (AP) — Millions of people across Britain face higher taxes and energy bills after the government on Thursday announced an emergency budget focused on restoring the country’s financial credibility and bolstering an economy battered by soaring inflation.

Treasury chief Jeremy Hunt unveiled a 55 billion-pound ($65 billion) package of tax increases and spending cuts designed to demonstrate that Britain is committed to paying its bills after his predecessor spooked financial markets by proposing tax cuts without saying how they would be paid for.

Hunt sought to cushion the blow by pledging to protect the most vulnerable, announcing that he would increase welfare benefits and state pension payments in line with inflation and help low-income residents with their energy bills. The government will also maintain investment in energy and infrastructure projects to boost economic growth, he said.

Even so, the government's fiscal watchdog warned that Britons face a painful 7% fall in living standards over the next two years.

“The British people are tough, inventive and resourceful. We have risen to bigger challenges before,’’ Hunt told the House of Commons. “We aren’t immune to these headwinds, but with this plan for stability, growth and public services, we will face into the storm.’’

Hunt and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who took office less than a month ago, face the challenge of tackling inflation and a growing deficit while helping millions of people slammed by a cost-of-living crisis as Russia’s war in Ukraine pushes up food and energy prices.

That task was made more difficult by former Prime Minister Liz Truss, who in September announced 45 billion pounds ($53 billion) in unfunded tax cuts that sent the pound to a record low against the U.S. dollar, boosted government borrowing costs and forced the central bank to intervene to stabilize bond markets. Truss was forced to resign six weeks after taking office.

A biggest criticism was that Truss’ policies were introduced before being reviewed by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, a mistake Hunt and Sunak took pains to avoid.

The agency said Hunt’s proposals would help slow inflation, boost economic growth and rein in government spending over the next five years.

Even so, soaring prices will cut real wages and living standards by 7% over the next two years, even as the government spends an additional 100 billion pounds on support programs, the OBR said in its analysis of the budget and the state of the economy.

“This type of contraction has never been recorded in Britain’s postwar history,” said Barret Kupelian, a senior economist at PwC.

Declining incomes, rising interest rates and a drop in home prices will tip the economy into a recession lasting more than a year from the third quarter of this year through the middle of 2023, the OBR predicted. A recession is an extended period of economic contraction, often defined as two consecutive quarters of shrinking output.

Britain doesn’t have an independent body that declares recessions like in the U.S. and Europe, which use other data like rising unemployment and job losses in their assessments.

The OBR said U.K. unemployment is likely to rise to 4.9% in the third quarter of next year from 3.5% now. Inflation, which reached a 41-year high of 11.1% in October, will fall sharply over next year, dropping below zero in the middle of the decade before returning to the Bank of England’s 2% target in 2027, it predicted.

The grim economic picture is weighing on government finances, reducing tax revenue, driving up welfare spending and increasing borrowing costs. As a result, the OBR estimates that government borrowing will jump by a third to 177 billion pounds, or 7.1% of economic output, in the current fiscal year.

Borrowing will begin dropping after that, declining to 2.4% of gross domestic product in the 2027-28 fiscal year. That means government debt will rise to a 63-year high of 98% of GDP over the next three years before it begins to decline, the OBR forecast.

In an effort to close the gap, Hunt said he would ask “more from those who have more” and lower the threshold for the highest tax bracket — 45% — by almost 25,000 pounds a year, costing high-earners about 1,200 pounds annually.

The government also will freeze the income levels at which taxpayers move into higher tax brackets, effectively raising taxes for hundreds of thousands of workers as inflation pushes up their wages.

“This, along with a double whammy of high inflation and higher taxes could mean a potential pay cut rather than a pay rise,” said Faye Church, a chartered financial planner at Investec Wealth & Investments.

The government also bowed to public pressure to increase taxes on the huge profits of energy producers. Hunt raised the windfall tax on oil and gas companies to 35% from 25% and extended it to March 2028. Electricity firms will have to pay a new temporary levy of 45%.

Hunt said the taxes would raise a combined 14 billion pounds next year.

He promised to protect public spending on key areas such as health and education as well as investment in energy and infrastructure projects. He delayed major spending cuts until 2025 — after the next general election — and deferred key decisions such as whether to stick to the previous government’s promise to increase defense spending to 3% of economic output.

Pensioners and people on welfare benefits will see their payments increase in line with inflation, while millions of workers on minimum wage will get a 9.7% increase in April, Hunt said.

Millions of households face higher energy bills, however, when a price cap rises from 2,500 pounds a year for the average household to 3,000 pounds in April.

Hunt said he would soften the blow by increasing support payments for low-income families and those with disabilities.

Rachel Reeves, economy spokeswoman for the opposition Labour Party, said the budget would leave Britain in a “doom loop where low growth leads to higher taxes, lower investments and squeezed wages, with the running down of public services.”

Among those who are looking to the government for help is Magdelena Prosenic, a single mom of two young children who was waiting in line at a community food pantry in south London.

For 5 pounds, people can buy 20 items of fresh fruit, vegetables and essential items like tinned beans and pasta. But eggs, which have shot up in price, are in high demand, and there are only enough for those who come early.

“We are on benefits, but it’s hard to provide for two children without help,” Prosenic said Wednesday. “The kids need fruit, they need nappies and formula.”

Anna Sjovorr-Packham, who runs the pantry, said the numbers of families buying food from them is creeping up “slowly but steadily.” And the cold winter months are coming, when families need to spend more on heating.

“I think there was once an idea that people who access food pantries may need the service as a last-case scenario — there may be a stigma about the type of person,″ she said. “But now the pantries are definitely utilized by everybody.”"

The emergency budget largely postponed public spending cuts until 2025 – after the next national election — and promised more money for key areas including education and health. Hunt also included help for British society’s most vulnerable, raising pensions and welfare benefits in line with inflation and boosting the minimum wage by 9.7%.

But millions of people in the U.K. face higher energy bills in the spring, when the government plans to cut back on support that has capped the average household’s utility bill at 2,500 pounds ($3,000) a year – more than double what it was a year ago. Bills are expected to increase to 3,000 pounds ($3,575) a year on average.

Hunt said the steps he was taking meant a predicted recession would be “shallower” than it otherwise would have been.

LONDON (AP) — Britain’s Conservative government on Friday defended its decision to hike taxes for millions of working people in the “squeezed middle” class as it tries to shore up an economy battered by double-digit inflation and the reckless tax-cutting of recently ousted Prime Minister Liz Truss.

An emergency budget announced by Treasury chief Jeremy Hunt on Thursday includes 25 billion pounds ($30 billion) in tax hikes, including higher income tax for middle and top earners and steeper local household taxes. The Treasury acknowledged that the moves will take taxes as a share of national income to its highest level since World War II.

The combination of high inflation – predicted to be 9.1% for 2022, largely driven by soaring energy costs from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – and stagnating salaries means a 7% decline in U.K. living standards over the next two years, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government’s fiscal watchdog.

“The truth is, we just got a lot poorer,” Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said.

“We’re in for a long, hard, unpleasant journey,” he added, with “high borrowing, high debt, high tax and public spending under strain.”

Hunt reversed the billions of pounds in unfunded tax cuts announced by his predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng less than two months ago – a package that spooked financial markets, sent the pound plunging to a record low against the U.S. dollar and forced emergency intervention from the Bank of England.

Hunt also renounced the central principle touted by Kwarteng and Truss: that lower taxes are the key to economic growth.

And they walked up on stage and shook hands with all their new colleagues. It was all very cordial, lots of polite smiles...the tone very much was ‘we can be grownups and get on with it. There’s a big job here to do at AGL, and we can unify’.”

Tony: “Don’t you love it when a CEO says ‘we are disciplined, we will not overpay’ and here’s an offer on the table at $25 a share. And here we are not that long afterwards, and it’s $28 a share. So, they’ve really lifted this to get it over the line.”

James: “I’m going to disagree here Tony, I reckon this is a bargain. I reckon BHP has almost got this on the cheap. I reckon, in the long-term, copper demand is only going to go up with the energy transition, I reckon this will prove to be a bargain.”

1f49f6a5-db44-4c67-a4f6-d269a05581c3,"One younger reader surveyed by The Age said: “Are we in a never-ending cycle of politicians kicking the can down the road when it comes to debt?” Another reader in their 60s said: “I wouldn’t try to reduce the debt, but rather make sure that the borrowings are used to provide valuable community infrastructure, which in turn boosts employment and wealth.” Standard & Poor’s uses a different accounting method to assess the financial position of governments than that preferred by federal and state treasury departments. The rating agency places a greater emphasis on cash flow and the gross debt borne by governments and all public funded agencies. Under this accounting method, Victoria is heading towards a tax-supported debt of $195 billion by mid-2026, nearly double that of Queensland.

The state’s after-capital account balance – the money it has to borrow to bridge the difference between its cash inflows and outflows – is currently running at about a third of total revenue. The current level (31 per cent) is expected to halve next financial year. But there are significant risks that could jeopardise that. Walker said this was the worst ratio S&P had recorded at any time for an Australian government. Walker said the deficit was caused by three factors: a 60 per cent growth in public sector wages overseen by the Andrews government in its pre-pandemic years; the fiscal shock delivered by the COVID crisis and the state’s protracted lockdowns and the size of the government’s “Big Build” infrastructure program. The cost of servicing those loans is forecast to soak up 6.5 per cent of total government revenue, compared with 4.5 per cent for NSW.

The official outlook for the budget this financial year has been downgraded twice in recent weeks. At the end of last month, Treasury’s mid-financial year budget update showed the deficit deteriorated by a further $1.8 billion in 2022-23 to $9.7 billion, despite higher-than-expected payroll and land taxes. Then Treasury’s pre-election budget update last week added another $500 million to that, taking the deficit prediction to $10.2 billion. RMIT public policy emeritus professor David Hayward said the state government had ramped up borrowing to save lives and protect businesses during the pandemic and was now banking on the idea that Victoria’s large deficits would shrink as the economy recovers. Premier Daniel Andrews and Opposition Leader Matthew Guy are both banking on economic growth to power Victoria out of its fiscal hole. Credit:Eddie Jim Although the budget predictions support this plan, Hayward said the election campaign had complicated the fiscal situation because of the substantial new spending promised by both major parties. According to the limited data published by the Parliamentary Budget Office, the Coalition has promised $30 billion in new spending and Labor about $10 billion. Hayward said a more careful analysis of the figures suggested the Coalition had been outspending Labor at a ratio of slightly more than two to one.

The election costings of both parties will be published next week in the final days of the campaign. Treasurer Tim Pallas said the Parliamentary Budget Office figures suggested the opposition’s only plan was to revert to Kennett-era austerity and cuts. “Matthew Guy’s Liberals have no plan other than to cut and close what matters to Victorians,” he said. So far, neither major party has pledged significant new revenue or savings measures to offset their new spending pledges. Instead, both Labor and the Coalition parties are banking on economic growth to repair the state’s budget over the long term. On Wednesday, Premier Daniel Andrews defended his government’s record on borrowing, saying it was necessary to weather the pandemic and meet the state’s infrastructure needs.

“We have got to keep building our way out of these difficult times and that is exactly that Labor has a plan to do,” he said. Opposition Leader Matthew Guy, in an interview with The Age earlier in the campaign, similarly rejected the need for either spending cuts or tax increases to repair the budget. We are focused on growth-led recovery,” he said. “We will not achieve economic growth by a 1990s economic strategy.” State Treasurer Tim Pallas. Credit:Jason South The opposition has promised to legislate a “debt cap” to put a ceiling on future borrowings and Guy claims his promise to scrap the government’s signature project – the Suburban Rail Loop – represents a significant budget saving. This is challenged by Walker’s analysis. He said the opposition’s decision to redirect about $8.7 billion currently earmarked for the rail project into building more hospitals would aggravate rather than ease the fiscal pressure.

“They have promised no new taxes, the question is how are they going to fund the operating side?” Walker said. “If you build more hospitals you are going to increase your employee expenses by billions of dollars.” Shadow treasurer David Davis insisted the opposition’s plan to rein in future spending by cutting major projects would work. He pointed out that 45 per cent of recurrent health costs were met by the Commonwealth, and said the Coalition’s plan to refurbish some existing hospitals would require minimal extra recurrent spending. “The Liberals and Nationals recognise the challenge and have developed a long-term economic plan,” Davis said. Health economist Stephen Duckett estimates that every dollar spent building a hospital requires an additional 50¢ a year to run it. Using this rule of thumb, Hayward calculates that Labor will need to find an extra $3 billion a year and the Coalition an extra $4 billion to run the new hospitals they are promising they build.

“The additional challenge for the Coalition is that they want to legislate a debt cap and they do not want to raise taxes,” RMIT’s Hayward said. “That is a budget time bomb, which has been planted just at that point in time when spending growth needed to slow down because we are effectively at full employment.” Walker said a Coalition win on November 26 would require S&P to conduct a “wholesale stocktake” of the state’s fiscal position. Loading S&P stripped the state of its AAA credit rating at the peak of the COVID crisis, but in June this year held its AA rating stable on the assumption that the state’s finances were structurally sound and after-capital deficits would improve. “Underpinning our ‘AA’ rating is our belief that economic growth is recovering and that the state’s economy remains structurally wealthy and diverse,” it’s ratings assessment noted."

2685962a-62db-4f01-93cf-b730fddd7bc6,"All that sounds pretty dire, but in the world of economics, it can depend on your perspective. No one is saying the state government cannot pay its bills, but the pandemic did force it, mostly for good reasons, to dramatically lift its borrowings to financially support people and the business community during extended lockdowns.

This week, credit rating agency Standard & Poor’s revealed that, after the government’s infrastructure program is taken into account, Victoria’s bottom line is the worst the agency has encountered in an Australian jurisdiction, and it is deteriorating.

In dollar terms, the pre-election budget update revealed that state spending would exceed revenue by $10.2 billion this financial year. As a sign of how difficult the government is finding it to balance the books, it forecast a $7.9 billion deficit in May, then changed it to $9.7 billion in the mid-financial-year budget, released less than two weeks before the latest, $10.2 billion, estimate. That’s a $500 million readjustment in a fortnight.

The fiscal alarm bells are ringing in the state of Victoria, but the question is, how concerned should we be? Victoria has the highest debt (in proportional terms) of all the states. According to the Treasury, net debt is expected to hit 20.4 per cent of gross state product by the end of this financial year. Before the pandemic, it was about 5 per cent.

So how bad is it really? Economist Chris Richardson puts it this way: “It is not broken, but it does need a degree of fixing.” He also had some advice as the state heads to the polls: “Whatever you do, don’t have an election campaign that pretends it doesn’t [need fixing].”

That is precisely what our political leaders, from both parties, are doing.

This contradicts one of the concern of readers of The Age, who, through our Victoria’s Agenda program, called for an adult discussion about controlling the deficit and beginning to reduce debt. “Are we in a never-ending cycle of politicians kicking the can down the road when it comes to debt?” asks Mr Bon, a 25 to 34-year-old from St Kilda. Another reader says: “Taxes must increase to pay for increased government services.”

With Labor well ahead in the polls, you would think it best placed to keep its spending in check or propose sensible tax reform. And yet, the Andrews government has made hundreds of election promises at a total cost of more than $10 billion at a time when net debt is expected to be $165.4 billion by the middle of 2026, or 24.8 per cent of the state economy. The Coalition has made new announcements worth at least twice as much as Labor’s, though they are partially offset by its promised $8 billion saving from scrapping the first stage of the Suburban Rail Loop. The Greens have also pledged spending without any sign of restraint.

What is also not openly discussed is the ongoing costs that will be incurred from promises made. This is particularly true in health, where both parties are battling it out over hospital upgrades and new facilities. Health economist Stephen Duckett estimates that every dollar spent building a hospital requires an additional 50¢ a year to run it. RMIT public policy emeritus professor David Hayward believes this means Labor will need to find an extra $3 billion a year and the Coalition an extra $4 billion to run the new hospitals they are promising."

A powerful subcommittee in the House of Representatives is seeking internal documents and communications from Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX to understand how the crypto exchange collapsed so suddenly and what is being done to recover customer funds.

FTX, formerly one of the most trusted brands in crypto, filed for bankruptcy last week and announced the resignation of Bankman-Fried, its 30-year-old CEO who lost a fortune.

In a Friday letter, Democratic Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, chairman of the Oversight Committee’s Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy, said he is “extremely troubled” by the FTX bankruptcy and the “potentially significant harm” it will cause to American consumers and investors.

Krishnamoorthi is requesting detailed information on the liquidity crisis facing FTX, the sudden decision to declare bankruptcy and what the company plans to do to “ensure that every single dollar is returned to American consumers who placed their trust in your company.”

The subcommittee, which had already launched an investigation into the crypto industry in August, asked for information and documents by December 1, including all internal documents and communications since 2021 related to FTX’s liquidity problems, balance sheet, customer funds, cryptocurrency holdings, money owed to customers and handling of customer funds.

“FTX investors and the American people demand answers,” Krishnamoorthi said.

Neither FTX nor a lawyer representing Bankman-Fried responded to a request for comment.

The letter cited revelations by newly-installed FTX CEO John J. Ray, who in court filings this week described a “complete failure” by the crypto company to maintain financial controls. Ray said the failures at FTX eclipse even that of Enron, the infamous company whose liquidation he oversaw in the early 2000s.

Krishnamoorthi said he’s “distressed” comments Bankman-Fried has made since the FTX bankruptcy, including an interview with Vox this week where the former FTX boss said he “didn’t mean” to “do sketchy stuff,” but that “each individual decision seemed fine and I didn’t realize how big their sum was until the end.”

Bankman-Fried was a face of the crypto industry and had emerged as a white knight for struggling companies. He was also a leading campaign contributor to Democrats during the 2022 election cycle.

Earlier this week, Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Dick Durbin demanded FTX and Bankman-Fried turn over a trove of documents that will shed light on the collapse, including balance sheets and details on bailouts given to other crypto firms."
46c01571-4ad9-4ded-a9e0-355b6438bd12,"It is pretty clear from all the reports now flowing about the way FTX operated that its management was shambolic and arguably incompetent, its risk-management illusory, its bookkeeping erratic at best and its protection of its clients’ funds non-existent. Indeed the co-mingling of client funds held on the FTX platform with Bankman-Fried’s own hedge fund, Alameda Research – it appears that billions of those dollars were handed over the Alameda to essentially gamble on crypto assets so that Bankman-Fried could try to climb out of a hole within Alameda’s balance sheet – speaks to something far worse than an absence of systems to segregate customer funds from the company’s own operations. As contagion spreads through the sector – other entities are experiencing liquidity and potentially solvency issues as investors flee – the interconnectedness and vulnerability to “runs” of some of the larger participants is becoming apparent. The collapse of FTX will lead to much-needed change. Credit:Getty The fact that, as is the case with a lot of the traded crypto assets, much of the “value” in the FTX and Alameda balance sheets was attributable to digital tokens that Bankman-Fried essentially created out of thin air, speaks to the downside potential of the leverage – financial and structural – in key segment of the crypto sector and the scale of the potential losses investors could face. Its chaotic and unpalatable.

In some jurisdictions regulation is already on the drawing boards. The European Union’s “Markets in Crypto Assets” legislation has been drafted and approved but has yet to be enacted. Here, after a comprehensive Senate inquiry last year, the federal government plans to introduce legislation next year. In the US there is ongoing wrangling over how intrusive any regulation should be and which regulator – the Securities and Exchange Commission or (as Bankman-Fried favoured and lobbied and donated aggressively for) the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. That reflects the tension between regulating crypto entities as if they were mainstream financial institutions (in which case it would be the SEC chosen as the primary regulator) or using a minimalist approach (the CFTC) to try to avoid choking the sector’s entrepreneurial spirit and potential.

In all the key jurisdictions the thrust of their proposals is similar, albeit not the same, and draws on their experiences in regulating conventional financial institutions. Loading The Senate’s recommendations effectively focus on regulating the crypto exchanges. They would need to be licensed, meet minimum capital adequacy standards, be audited, would have to segregate customers’ funds from their own, be subject to the anti-money laundering and “know your customer” requirements and their key staff would be vetted under the “responsible person” regime. The proposed EU legislation would be more extensive and more intrusive but has similar emphases on customer protection, custodial arrangements and anti-money laundering provisions. Drawing on what has been learned from the FTX experience – and other collapses, hacks and frauds in the sector – it is clear that more transparency is required if investors are to be given their own ability to assess the stability of the organisations to which they trust their funds.

That’s not by itself a perfect solution. We have that in traded security markets, where the companies are subject to disclosure regimes, are audited, are scrutinised by professional analysts and investors and scandals still emerge. It is, however, a starting point. It might also help what are in many cases very immature businesses led by quite inexperienced people more focused on their IT systems than financial risk-management. Bankman-Fried is a 30-year-old who had no grasp of his own balance sheet. Others in the sector are urgently commissioning their own audits, largely to reassure investors and lenders but also, one suspects, to reassure themselves in an environment where the underlying assets – crypto assets – is extremely volatile and hundreds of millions of “value” has evaporated. If FTX’s collapse means regulation that can bring more sunlight to bear on crypto markets and impose some core investor protections will be brought forward, that would be a good thing for investors and the credibility of the digital assets sector more broadly. External audits and regulatory oversight are essential pieces of any regulatory architecture, albeit that experience with conventional companies says they provide no guarantees.

Segregation of customer funds should be another non-negotiable. Customer funds held by exchanges or other trading entities need to be held in trust and their use monitored by an authorised custodian to avoid what has occurred in FTX. It is not clear that the use of FTX client monies to essentially gamble within Alameda is even illegal, given that FTX is registered in the Bahamas. That suggests some thought might also have to be given to how to regulate offshore-based entities operating within regulated jurisdictions and probably leads towards eventual international harmonisation of regulatory efforts. The anti-money laundering and “know your customer” requirements that are common in proposed regulatory frameworks are an attempt to remove the anonymity that cloaks and facilitates some of the sector’s less legitimate activities. They oughtn’t impact legitimate activity. The immaturity and volatility of traded crypto assets is such that no level of regulation will insure against losses or malpractices but centuries of regulatory experience in traditional markets doesn’t do that anyway."
99dcb87d-7185-4717-8ffa-6bc36cfdbe74,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Lawmakers plan to investigate the failure of FTX, the large crypto exchange that collapsed last week and filed for bankruptcy protection, leaving investors and customers staring at losses that could total in the billions of dollars.

The House Financial Services Committee said Wednesday that it expects to hear from Sam Bankman-Fried, the 30-year-old founder and former CEO of FTX, who was previously hailed as a hero in the crypto community but now faces potential civil and criminal charges related to FTX's collapse.

The panel also expects to get testimony from FTX representatives, other crypto exchanges including Binance, Bankman-Fried’s hedge fund, Alameda Research, and others at a December hearing.

“The fall of FTX has posed tremendous harm to over one million users, many of whom were everyday people who invested their hard-earned savings into the FTX cryptocurrency exchange, only to watch it all disappear within a matter of seconds,” committee chairperson Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) said in an emailed statement.

FTX filed for bankruptcy protection Friday, sending shockwaves through the cryptocurrency industry, which has seen an enormous amount of volatility this year, including a sharp decline in the price of bitcoin and other digital assets.

But the sheer size of FTX's collapse highlights the massive market risks inherent in the growing crypto industry. Billions of dollars of wealth may have been destroyed in a few days. The circumstances have prompted investigations by the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission.

“We must get to the bottom of this for FTX’s customers and the American people,” ranking member Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) said. “It’s essential that we hold bad actors accountable so responsible players can harness technology to build a more inclusive financial system.”

Bankman-Fried has testified in Congress before, saying at a Senate Agriculture Committee hearing on the risks presented by digital assets in February that crypto firms should address risks to “ensure against substantial or catastrophic losses that could lead to existential threats against their own firm, thereby imperiling the assets of their customers.”

In March, President Joe Biden issued an executive order directing the Treasury Department and other agencies to study the impact of cryptocurrency on financial stability and national security.

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said during several hearings on the Hill this year that more government regulation is needed to police the proliferation of cryptocurrency, due to risks posed to financial markets.

On Wednesday Yellen said “the federal government, including Congress, also needs to move quickly to fill the regulatory gaps the Biden Administration has identified.”

Dollar Gains Fizzle Out as Traders Reassess Risks From Poland

TOKYO/LONDON—The dollar on Wednesday traded just above multi-month lows against most majors as flows that had supported the safe-haven currency slowed after Joe Biden said a missile that caused an explosion in Poland may not have been fired from Russia.

NATO-member Poland and Ukraine said on Tuesday the blast that killed two on the Polish side of their border was likely caused by a Russian-made rocket, raising concerns of an escalation in the war.

However, Biden said the weapon was probably not fired by Russia, although the investigation was ongoing.

Russia denies it was responsible for the explosion. NATO ambassadors will hold an emergency meeting on Wednesday with a news conference due around 11.30 GMT.

The euro was last 0.47 percent higher at $1.0399. It was heading back towards the four-and-a-half month high of $1.0481 it touched a day earlier after U.S. producer price inflation was below expectations, reinforcing bets that last week’s cooler-than-expected consumer price inflation was not a one-off.

The European common currency was then knocked off that high, falling as low as $1.028 after news of the explosion in Poland sent traders to the safety of the dollar, which also caused falls in equities.

Kim Mundy senior currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia said the euro would take its direction from the dollar and was “susceptible to another fall if there is a ratcheting higher in geopolitical tensions”.

“Geopolitical risks continue to hang over currency markets and are likely to remain a key driver of volatility,” she said.

Away from geopolitics, slowing U.S. inflation, if sustained, should mean the U.S. Federal Reserve can slow or even pause the aggressive rate hikes that have supported the dollar this year.

British inflation in contrast is continuing to rise, hitting a 41-year high in the 12 months to October, data released on Wednesday showed, though sterling looked beyond this to trade on the day at $1.1871.

Simon Harvey, head of FX analysis at Monex Europe, said the muted reaction was primarily because the CPI data was in line with the BoE’s expectations, but “the overall shift in cross-asset risk conditions due overnight also means focus for GBP traders is outside of UK specific developments.”

Britain will announce a new budget on Thursday in which finance minister Jeremy Hunt is expected to announce tax hikes and spending cuts. The pound fell to a record low of $1.0327 in September after Hunt’s predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng announced a package of unfunded tax cuts.

The dollar was 0.2 percent firmer on the Japanese yen at 139.63 influenced by a rise in U.S. long-term Treasury yields during Tokyo trading as haven demand eased, but still near Tuesday’s two-and-a-half-month low.

The greenback was also down 0.15 percent on the Swiss franc at 0.9418, near Tuesday’s seven-month low, and the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six main peers, was 0.24 percent lower at 106.26.

Retirement Tip of the Week: If you haven’t checked the allocation of your investments recently, do so now to make sure that the makeup of your portfolio will keep you on track for your goals. If your portfolio breakdown is off, it’s time to rebalance.

It’s natural for asset allocations, which is how a portfolio is invested among various types of investments, to shift during market volatility — suddenly, what was once a 60/40 portfolio divided between stocks and bonds could be 50/50 or 70/30. Asset allocation is an important factor in getting a person to their goals, and the wrong mix could set savers back.

Rebalancing is important any year, especially after a year like 2022, when investors have faced unnerving news around volatility, inflation and interest.

But keep in mind that these portfolios are meant to be long-term, and should have been invested in a way that will weather the ups and downs of the market for long-term goals, said Matthew Gelfand, a certified financial planner and executive director of Tricolor Capital Advisors.

“Rebalancing should occur when asset classes wander outside their allocation ranges,” he said. For example, a portfolio that was invested 65% in stocks and 35% in bonds and has a 3% tolerance would mean that portfolio could still function well if stocks were to become anywhere between 62% and 68% of the portfolio. Outside of those ranges, the portfolio would be rebalanced. (The tolerance limit can be more than that — you should consider consulting with a financial planner or a professional at the firm managing your retirement account.)

Investors with target-date funds have portfolios that are automatically rebalanced, since those investments are tied to an estimated retirement year (such as 2055, or 2060) and therefore tick more conservatively as the years go on. Clients of financial planners may also have someone who is already checking accounts and periodically rebalancing portfolios. Employer-sponsored retirement plans, like a 401(k), might also have features that include automatically rebalancing, such as on an annual or quarterly basis.

Still, it never hurts to check. And it’s good practice to schedule that portfolio check-up yourself. The new year is a great time to do it, said William Parrott, a certified financial planner and chief executive officer at Parrott Wealth Management. “January is an excellent time to rebalance investment accounts because all the dividends and capital gains have been credited to the account,” he said. Other experts say that checkup could even be performed semi-annually, or quarterly.

There’s a stark difference between rebalancing and active investing, so if you’re changing your portfolio too much, you’re “speculating, not investing,” said Larry Luxenberg, a certified financial planner and principal at Lexington Avenue Capital Management.

Retirement plans are often a “set it and forget it” type of account. “The main thing is to put together a good portfolio and then leave it alone to do its work,” Luxembourg said. “Only a major disruption in the markets or big changes in personal circumstances should prompt more frequent changes.”

Rebalancing an investment portfolio is the process of making sure the proportion of asset types in your portfolio reflects your goals. It builds on two tenets of investing, diversification and consistency. It’s a necessary process because various securities rise and fall at different rates so that over time the asset allocation you chose when you created your portfolio will change. Consider working with a financial advisor on rebalancing. Here’s an overview of why, how and when to rebalance your portfolio.

What Is Rebalancing?

Rebalancing is the act of switching up your investments to get back to the asset allocation you’re most comfortable with. Your asset allocation is the mix of securities you have in your portfolio based on your risk tolerance, goals and timeline. For example, if you’re very risk-averse, it’s best to have mostly bonds and cash in your portfolio.

There are two reasons to rebalance. One is to restore the proportion of asset types you designed your portfolio to have. Another is to modify that proportion because your investment goals have evolved and you want your portfolio to now reflect those newer choices.

Sometimes it’s not necessary for you to rebalance because it’s being done for you. If you have a target date fund, for example, the fund managers will do that for you. Some investment accounts, like 401(k)s may have an automatic rebalancing feature. Put in your percentages of asset allocation and it will keep that portion of your portfolio rebalanced for you.

How to Rebalance Your Portfolio

Once you make your initial investments, they will either gain or lose. They will also generate income in the form of interest and dividends. As these changes occur over time, the initial asset allocation you chose will change. You may reinvest your dividends. You may add money to your top-performing investments, hoping to reap the benefit of dollar-cost averaging as they increase in value. Maybe you will follow the investing principle of buy low, sell high and add money to your lower-performing investments if they have a history of being good performers.

As you add money to your investments and reinvest dividends, your portfolio will no longer have the same asset allocation. If you had a 50/50 plan in place for stocks and bonds, those percentages will become gradually skewed. At the end of your first year of investing, you may have 60% stocks and 40% bonds, quite a bit off from your initial asset allocation plan.

How Often Your Portfolio Should Be Rebalanced

Investment securities in a shopping cart

There is no set amount of time for rebalancing that works for everyone. In the example above, it’s clearly time for portfolio rebalancing. You will either need to sell some of your higher-performing stock or add money to the fixed-income portion of your portfolio to get your asset allocation back to the original 50/50 that you were comfortable with. This will shield you from more risk than you want since your portfolio is now heavy on equity securities. Rebalancing will get you back to your risk preference, initial investment goals and time horizon.

Many investors decide when to rebalance by choosing a rebalancing threshold, a percentage that represents how far the asset allocation of your investment portfolio has strayed from your plan. Will you rebalance if your asset allocations are 1% off? Or will you wait to rebalance when they’re 5% or 10% off? Those are questions you’ll have to answer based on your personal circumstances.

Another way to decide when to rebalance is to simply do it on a regular basis. You can decide to rebalance periodically, such as quarterly or every other month. Or you can rebalance a couple of times a year.

The Cost of Rebalancing

Before you buy or sell any securities, you’ll need to make sure you can afford to rebalance. Can you cover the fees you might have to pay upfront for purchasing a new asset or selling off one you currently have? It’s also a good idea to look at the expense ratio of the securities you’re interested in. That tells you what percentage of your assets are going toward management fees.

Besides the financial consequences of rebalancing, you’ll need to remember that the process could be somewhat time-consuming. It’ll take longer than a few minutes to finish, so you’ll need to make room in your schedule to rebalance.

Don’t Forget About Taxes

As you rebalance, you’ll need to pay attention to how it might affect your tax bill. Selling profitable investments can trigger the capital gains tax, either short- or long-term. But luckily, you can minimize your tax bite by selling off assets that have experienced a loss and replacing them with others.

If you decide to use this strategy, known as tax-loss harvesting, it’s important to tread carefully. If you replace a stock 30 days before or after selling one that’s almost identical to it, you’ll break the IRS’s wash-sale rule. If that happens, you won’t be able to use the loss to offset any of your gains until you sell off the similar shares later on.

Bottom Line

It’s important to rebalance your portfolio on a regular basis in order to adhere to your tolerance for risk, investment goals, and desired time horizon. Otherwise, your portfolio will gradually veer from your chosen path. If you want to change your asset allocation at some point, you can do that, but it should be planned and your own choice.

Portfolio rebalancing may not be a good idea this year. You may want to avoid it altogether.

I’m referring to the process of bringing each asset’s portfolio weight back into line with its assigned weight. That involves selling marginal portions of assets that have performed better than average and buying additional shares of assets that have lagged. Though you can rebalance at whatever frequency you desire, investors most commonly do so in December.

Rebalancing seems like an utterly obvious and unobjectionable thing to do. After all, if you didn’t ever rebalance, then over time your best-performing asset would grow as a share of your portfolio and eventually come to dominate it. In that event, your portfolio’s risk would increase far beyond what you desire.

One consequence of rebalancing being so obvious, however, is that few ever stop to wonder whether there are better or worse ways to go about it. That’s unfortunate, since there very much are times you would want to avoid it—and this year may be one of them.

Read: Your 401(k) has had a wild year — how to know when it’s time to rebalance

According to various researchers, three preconditions must be true before rebalancing stands a good chance of improving your performance. Here’s how this year-end stacks up against those preconditions:

Uncorrelated assets

The first precondition is that the assets in your portfolio must to at least some extent be uncorrelated, meaning that some will be performing better when others are performing poorly. While this is generally true for stocks and bonds, it is not this year, since bonds have performed just as poorly as stocks.

Consider what your portfolio allocation would be today if you began this year with 60% allocated to the stock market and 40% to bonds. Assuming you invested in total-market index funds, your current allocation would be 59.4% in stocks and 40.6% in bonds. That’s not a big enough deviation from your portfolio’s default allocation to make it worth your while even bothering with rebalancing.

Mean reversion

Another precondition making rebalancing worthwhile is that your portfolio’s assets are mean reverting. In other words, after above-average performance in a given period, an asset will tend to be a below-average performer in the subsequent period—and vice versa.

The opposite of mean reversion is momentum or trend following. And to the extent these contrary conditions exist, rebalancing actually makes matters worse, because by doing that you will be periodically investing more in your losing asset(s) just as they are poised to lose even more.

The third precondition is related to the second: The mean reversion must occur at the same frequency of your rebalancing. So even if mean reversion exists, rebalancing near the end of the year would still not be a good idea unless the assets your portfolio owns tend to mean-revert annually in December.

% of all years since 1793 in which asset rose Following years in which asset rose, % of time asset rose in subsequent year Following years in which asset fell, % of time asset rose in subsequent year Bonds 73.5% 79.4% 57.4% Stocks 69.5% 71.8% 64.3%

Do the stock and bond markets satisfy these second and third preconditions? I am struck by how few investors have ever asked this question, much less attempted to answer it.

The data in the accompanying table are the beginning of an answer to this question. Notice that it’s a mixed picture for both stocks and bonds. On the one hand, the odds of either asset rising in a given year decline if they have also fallen in the prior year as well. That’s not what you’d hope to see if you’re counting on mean reversion. On the other hand, notice that the odds of rising in that second year are still greater than 50%.

An even more revealing measure is to focus on stocks’ performance relative to bonds. Since 1793, stocks have outperformed bonds in 56.2% of the years. Following years in which stocks underperformed bonds, stocks the subsequent year beat bonds 57.6% of the time. That 1.4 percentage point increase reflects an awfully modest reversion to the mean.

Strategic Rebalancing

There may be a way forward, however, according to a study co-authored by Campbell Harvey, a finance professor at Duke University, and three researchers at London’s Man Group. They call their suggested solution “Strategic Rebalancing.”

The key to their approach is to not rebalance at preset intervals, but only when the assets in your portfolio are not exhibiting momentum or trend-following behavior. To the extent your losing assets remain in a well-defined downtrend, you would not rebalance.

To be sure, there’s no surefire way of pinpointing these downtrends. But the researchers report that you don’t have to be perfectly accurate to make Strategic Rebalancing worthwhile. One approach they suggest is to use a moving average crossover model to decide whether the trend is up or down—focusing on two moving averages of different lengths. You would rebalance only when your losing asset’s shorter moving average crosses above the longer one.

Consider, for example, a crossover model based on the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages. According to this particular version of the model, the trend currently remains down for both a total stock market index fund and a total bond market index fund. The 50-day moving average for the former is 7% below its 200-day, and for the latter it is 6% below.

The bottom line? The upcoming year-end period does not meet any of the preconditions that would make rebalancing worthwhile. So don’t bother.

Banks increased their junior ranks in the past two years to manage a deluge of transactions, but are downsizing to cope with an expected lull in dealmaking in 2023. There is also a push to trim expenses because many banks hired senior deal makers in the past year who inked guaranteed bonuses into their salaries before moving shops.

Credit Suisse is planning to reduce headcount by 9000 people globally, in line with a reorganisation taking place under new chief executive Ulrich Korner. Goldman Sachs introduced its annual peer review process – after putting it on ice for two years – to weed out under-performing bankers in September.

Changing of the guard

Credit Suisse bankers from New York to London have braced for lay-offs for months after the Swiss investment bank said it would restructure plans into one focused more on advisory services and less on capital intensive activities like underwriting.

Two managing directors, recently let go in New York, said they’d padded their resumes in advance of being fired. Others started job hunting after Credit Suisse endured million-dollar losses from the Archegos Capital Management scandal, which raised concerns over the bank’s risk management capabilities in 2021. The bank also took a hit when its funds were exposed to Greensill Capital, the supply chain lender, which filed for bankruptcy in April last year.

In Australia, Angelo Scasserra, Credit Suisse’s co-head of investment banking for Australia, will leave next year, the Financial Review’s Street Talk reported on Thursday.

UBS also snagged Veronica Kaufman, who ran local corporate derivatives at Credit Suisse, Street Talk reported this month. Melbourne-based Kaufman will join the Swiss rival in February as an executive director in its Australian capital markets team.

Sprint to the finish

Just as firms trim their teams, Australia’s investment banking divisions are ushering through jumbo-sized transactions to close out 2022.

Morgan Stanley is advising Crescent Capital on a roughly $800 million deal to sell its radiology business PRP Diagnostic to IFM and UniSuper. RBC Capital Markets is advising the buy side, Street Talk reported on November 1.

The IMF Australia Mission’s concluding economic statement for 2022 urged both the RBA and government to tighten monetary and fiscal policy respectively to avoid the significant economic headwinds emerging across the globe.

In what will be unwelcome news to mortgage holders, the IMF not only praised the rapid increases in the cash rate but has called for even more hikes.

“Continued monetary and fiscal policy tightening is needed to rebalance domestic demand and keep inflation expectations well anchored,” the statement said.

“The RBA should continue to raise interest rates.

“Monetary policy needs to be focused first and foremost on keeping inflation expectations well anchored, which clearly points to more tightening in the short term.”

As most of the world continues to grapple with the lasting economic effects of COVID and the ongoing pressures emerging from the war in Ukraine, a global recession looks increasingly likely.

Australia’s growth will slow from a peak of 3.7 per cent in 2022 to an expected 1.7 per cent in 2023/24 on the back of increasing interest rates, diminishing global export demand, continued inflation and declining housing prices.

The IMF also pointed to a risk in higher interest rates not converting into a stemming of demand, with household savings “still elevated”.

But the IMF has forecast Australia is likely to avoid the same economic headwinds battering the UK, Europe and the US.

“Between the slowing global growth and some still-resilient domestic buffers, Australia is on a narrow path for a soft landing,” it said.

The global financial agency also recommended the government’s fiscal policy should work cooperatively with the reserve bank.

It suggested the government continue “near-term fiscal restraint” while avoiding un-targeted cash splashes to alleviate cost of living pressures – all in a bid to drive down domestic demand.

“Fiscal support to address cost-of-living pressures should be temporary and well-targeted to help those in need, so that broader demand stimulus is avoided,” it continued.

“The budget’s streamlining of spending … should help avoid adding to aggregate demand pressures.

“In addition, saving of expected revenue overperformance and judicious implementation of the budget’s spending programs, including infrastructure investment, would help in containing demand and inflation.”

Treasurer Jim Chalmers has spruiked his first budget for its “responsible” reply to surging inflation primarily driven by rising energy and food costs.

The October budget forecast a massive jump in tax receipts due to record low unemployment and surging commodity prices.

But the government has boasted its decision to return 99 per cent of the tax upgrades in the first two years compared to the 25-year average of 40 per cent.

Dr Chalmers welcomed the report and the institution’s characterisation of Labor’s budget.

“The IMF confirms that the Budget was responsible, right for the times, and readies Australia for the future,” the Treasurer said in a statement on Wednesday.

“This is a ringing endorsement of the Albanese Government's approach to responsible economic management.

“It highlights the Government’s spending restraint and responsible approach to revenue upgrades won’t add to inflationary pressures in the economy.”"

The International Monetary Fund expects Australia to dodge a recession but has downgraded its expectations for growth next year.

The United Nations agency anticipates growth slowing to 1.7 per cent in 2023 – less than the 1.9 per cent forecast in its world economic outlook released last month.

In its annual health check on the Australian economy, the IMF pointed to Australia’s resilient domestic buffers to economic headwinds, including decent household savings.

“Between the slowing global growth and some still-resilient domestic buffers, Australia is on a narrow path for a soft landing,” the report said.

But Australia is not out of the woods – a larger-than-expected slowdown in China’s growth would put the nation’s exports at risk and higher inflation and wage growth domestically could prompt further interest rate rises from the central bank.

“The decline in housing prices has the potential to accelerate, which can reduce household consumption, with some impact on banks’ balance sheets,” the IMF warned.

The agency urged the Reserve Bank to keep lifting interest rates to cool demand and called on the government to keep spending constrained and targeted.

Treasurer Jim Chalmers said the IMF confirmed the Albanese government had delivered a budget “right for the times” in October.

“The government is returning 99 per cent of the upward tax revisions for the next two years to the budget when the inflation challenge is most severe, and 92 per cent over the forward estimates,” Dr Chalmers said.

“This compares to the former government’s average of around 40 per cent.”

The international agency also weighed in on Australia’s tax reform debate – noting the stage three tax cuts would reduce the personal income tax burden and Australia would be best to double down on “under-utilised” indirect taxes, such property taxes and the goods and services tax.

“Longstanding recommendations include broadening the GST base to limit exemptions for healthcare spending and restricting the capital gains tax exemption for the sale of main residences,” the report said.

The IMF recommended ditching stamp duty in favour of land taxes to promote housing affordability, labour mobility and a more sustainable tax base.

The agency welcomed Australia’s renewed commitment to climate mitigation and said more renewables in the grid would improve the resilience of the electricity sector and insulate the country from price spikes and energy market volatility.

While recognising the political challenges, the IMF said an economy-wide carbon price was the most effective way to cut emissions.

Despite Australia’s resilience to economic turmoil, a new report shows small businesses are starting to suffer.

CreditorWatch’s business risk index found small businesses were three times more likely to be falling behind on payments than big businesses.

Business to business payment defaults also continue to rise at an average rate of 20 per cent each month.

CreditorWatch chief economist Anneke Thompson said the rise in trade defaults, depressed consumer confidence and rising job vacancies all pointed to a slowing economy.

“Instinctively, this seems unwanted, but unfortunately a significant slowdown of the economy is one of the only cures for inflation,” she said.

“The challenge is not allowing small business to suffer the brunt of the impact of a slowing economy, which unfortunately is usually the case.”

The Office for National Statistics said the rate rose to 11.1 per cent from 10.1 per cent in September, putting inflation at its highest level since October 1981. Several economists had expected a rate of around 10.7 per cent.

Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Wednesday he's open to reducing the level of interest rate increases soon, so long as the economic data cooperates. The rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee is set to meet Dec. 13-14. Market expectations are running high that policymakers will approve another rate hike, but this time opting for a 0.5 percentage point, or 50 basis point, move. That would come after approving four consecutive 0.75 percentage point increases. ""Looking toward the FOMC's December meeting, the data of the past few weeks have made me more comfortable considering stepping down to a 50-basis-point hike,"" Waller said in prepared remarks for an event in Phoenix. ""But I won't be making a judgment about that until I see more data, including the next PCE inflation report and the next jobs report."" A basis point equals 0.01 percentage point.

The next PCE inflation report is due on Dec. 1. Investors have grown optimistic that a lower-than-expected increase in October's consumer price index reading is indicative that inflation is cooling. Headline CPI increased 0.4% for the month and 7.7% from a year ago, while the core reading excluding food and energy rose 0.3% and 6.3%, respectively. All the readings were lower than market estimates. The Fed favors the core personal consumption expenditures prices measurement, which rose 0.5% in September and 5.1% from a year ago, as a gauge of rising prices.

Waller said he'll be watching the data closely as he remains suspect that the October CPI readings confirmed a new trend. As a governor, he is an automatic voter on the FOMC. ""Though welcome news, we must be cautious about reading too much into one inflation report. I don't know how sustained this deceleration in consumer prices will be,"" he said. ""I cannot emphasize enough that one report does not make a trend. It is way too early to conclude that inflation is headed sustainably down."" In making his assessment, Waller said he will be looking at three principal data points apart from the broad inflation readings: core goods prices, housing and non-housing services. He said he's seeing encouraging signs on all three fronts but will need to see more and vowed not to be ""head-faked by one report."" ""Like many others, I hope this [CPI] report is the beginning of a meaningful and persistent decline in inflation. But policymakers cannot act based on hope,"" he said. Earlier in the day, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told CNBC that she expects at least another percentage point of rate increases ahead. The Fed's benchmark rate currently sits in a targeted range between 3.75% and 4%."
e251f02b-3046-4beb-91b6-a07088886cc2,"Recent economic data should allow the Federal Reserve to at least consider stepping down the pace of its interest rate hikes at its next meeting in December, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said Wednesday.

“Looking toward the FOMC’s December meeting, the data of the past few weeks have made me more comfortable considering stepping down to a 50-basis point hike,” Waller said, in a speech to an economic forecasters meeting in Phoenix, Arizona.

Waller added that he won’t make a final judgement until he sees more data. The next Fed interest-rate committee meeting is on Dec. 13-14.

So far this year, the Fed has raised its benchmark federal funds rate at a rapid clip – from near zero to a range of 3.75%-4%, including four straight 0.75 percentage point hikes since June.

Earlier this month, Fed officials signaled earlier that they were mulling slowing down the pace of rate hikes.

But at the same time, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters that even at a slower pace, the Fed might move rates higher than the ultimate 4.5%-4.75% range most officials had expected last summer.

In his remarks, Waller said a 50 basis point hike in December would still be a very significant tightening action. With rates now at a level where they are starting to dampen economic growth, the benchmark rate “can still be increased quite rapidly with several 50-basis-point increases, a pretty aggressive path for policy.”

Waller compared the Fed’s policy path to an airplane flight. The first hikes were like a pilot firing the engines to get the plane off the ground. Now the level of rates is closer to cruising speed, the pilot can slow the rate of ascent while continuing to climb.

The Fed governor repeated a comment he first made on Sunday that the smaller-than-expected rise in consumer prices in October was welcome, but was only one data point.

“I don’t know how sustained this deceleration in consumer prices will be,” he said.

“I will not be head-faked by one report,” he said."
6bcf5431-2248-428a-a09f-7de6e18013d4,"The saga of FTX, formerly one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges that fell rapidly into bankruptcy, took a new turn today after Vox published a series of messages with its former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. The erstwhile executive, known in the crypto world as SBF, discussed regulators, ethics and bankruptcy regrets, amongst other issues that have become the de jure conversation in tech since FTX itself immolated.

“Everyone goes around pretending that perception reflects reality, it doesn’t,” SBF said in a Twitter conversation with reporter Kelsey Piper. “Some of this decade's greatest heroes will never be known, and some of its most beloved people are basically shams.”

In the notes, shared in screenshot form by the publication, SBF spoke harshly of regulators, saying that they “make everything worse” and that “they don’t protect customers at all.” Given that SBF’s former company will soon face at least the American Congress, the approach and tone are notable.

His take on regulators is predicated, later messages make clear, on his view that their methods of control are too simplified -- “just ‘do more business’ vs ‘do less business’ and ‘put up more moats’ vs ‘put up fewer moats’” -- which doesn’t distinguish “between good and bad” in his estimation.

The Vox interview spent a good chunk of its time discussing ethics and philanthropy, an unsurprising choice given that SBF was a well-known person in the ""effective altruism"" movement, a method of helping others that focuses on what is practical. SBF was also an active political donor until recently, further keeping him in the media limelight.

Back on the matters most pertinent to TechCrunch, while discussing his own activities, SBF wrote that he “didn’t want to do sketchy stuff [as] there are huge negative effects from it,” adding in a following message that he “didn’t mean to.” Last week, SBF officially stepped down as chief executive of FTX while Enron wind-down veteran John J. Ray III was appointed as the new CEO.

Story continues

In response to SBF’s public statements, although we’re not exactly sure which ones as there are many, Ray published a statement saying that “Mr. Bankman-Fried has no ongoing role at FTX…and does not speak on their behalf.”

Later in the conversation with Vox, SBF brought up CZ, the well-known leader of Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world. CZ and SBF’s dueling Twitter accounts up until, and after, the FTX meltdown centered the attention of the world on their different business approaches, and leverage.

“A month ago CZ was a walking example of 'don’t do unethical shit or your money is worthless,'” SBF Wrote, “now he’s a hero,” later asking if the shift in his view of market perception of CZ was due to his being virtuous, or simply having had the “bigger balance sheet,” leading to CZ winning and not SBF. CZ’s comments about FTX’s native token FTT are viewed by some as a precipitating event in the collapse of the latter exchange; precisely where blame lies is not yet entirely clear, so grains of salt, please.

Interestingly enough, Bankman-Fried tells Vox that his “biggest single fuckup [was] the one thing everyone told” him to do: file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. He thinks if he hadn’t filed for bankruptcy, “withdrawals would be opening up in a month with customers fully whole.”

He adds: “But instead I filed, and the people in charge of it are trying to burn it all to the ground out of shame.” So Vox inquired whether he was suggesting he should’ve just kept trying to raise the $8 billion lifeline. SBF added that he might still get there, but with way more “collateral damage.”

Damage is correct. The impact is still being felt; at the other firms in the crypto trading and investing business or the smaller individuals and businesses that had assets on the platform (pre-bankruptcy). The fall-out even hurts early-stage entrepreneurs, with MIT Media Lab canceling its fellowship that was originally backed by FTX Future Fund.

There are entire chapters, if not volumes to come. And thankfully for those of us observing, and reporting, SBF continues to talk.

88f257aa-e534-48b6-880f-718e1ed25b2d,"U.S. Reportedly Considering Whether to Extradite Sam Bankman-Fried Over FTX Implosion

Sam Bankman-Fried, who was once considered the real ”wunderkind” of the crypto world, is desperately trying to defend his public image despite federal law enforcement investigations closing in.

Bloomberg reported Tuesday that the U.S. and the Bahamas may be looking to put FTX founder Bankman-Fried on a plane so he and Uncle Sam can have a little chat about the massive failure of his crypto exchange. According to three unnamed sources familiar with the matter, federal law enforcement has been talking more and more with Bahamian officials about the possibility of extraditing the 30-year-old crypto founder who often goes by SBF, though the island’s authorities have apparently said he is cooperating with them for the time being.

Bloomberg also noted that Bahamian police interviewed SBF on Saturday, but U.S. officials have yet to get in a room with the young once-multi-billionaire. FTX was once valued at $US32 ($44) billion, but since the start of this crypto calamity nearly all those funds have been squandered.

The Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York are probing FTX over fraud allegations surrounding its collapse. The U.S. attorney’s office declined to comment. Gizmodo also reached out to the DOJ for comment but we did not immediately hear back.

Notably, the Securities and Exchange Commission is separately investigating the failed crypto exchange over whether it was illegally selling securities in the form of crypto.

Bankman-Fried vacated his position as CEO last week at the same time practically all companies associated with the founder declared bankruptcy. Still, that hasn’t stopped him from trying to maintain that, even if some mistakes were made, “all I can do is try,” as he wrote in a Twitter thread Tuesday night.

Well, moreso he needs to desperately try to scrape together enough cash for customers who collectively lost millions of dollars when the exchange stopped processing withdrawals. At the same time, he seems desperate to show that as far as he knew back on Nov. 7, he had more assets than liabilities on the docket.

12) To the best of my knowledge, as of post-11/7, with the potential for errors:



a) Alameda had more assets than liabilities M2M (but not liquid!)

b) Alameda had margin position on FTX Intl

c) FTX US had enough to repay all customers



Not everyone necessarily agrees with this — SBF (@SBF_FTX) November 15, 2022

“Not everyone necessarily agrees with this,” Bankman-Fried added as a caveat, which may be the biggest understatement in the history of crypto. It also contradicts multiple reports from the Financial Times that said that FTX had less than $US1 ($1) billion in liquid assets and $US9 ($12) billion in liabilities by the end of its run, according to a balance sheet reportedly created by SBF Nov. 10. Most of its other remaining assets were illiquid, meaning they had very little value on the open market.

And just a reminder, On Nov. 7 SBF tweeted that “FTX is fine” and that the exchange had enough to cover all client holdings, adding that they “don’t invest client assets (even in treasuries).” Those tweets have since been deleted. Bankman-Fried has been desperately trying to save his image in interviews, but it seems neither authorities or those whose funds were stolen by his exchange seem ready to let him off the hook.

Reports on FTX’s fallout noted that SBF tried to prop up his high-profile trading firm Alameda research with $US10 ($14) billion in FTX customer funds. A new Wednesday report from Reuters based on company documents and interviews with current and former employees revealed that FTX was being used to benefit Alameda, despite both entities ostensibly being separate. Bankman-Fried had reportedly included the same assets on both FTX and Alameda’s balance sheets, and he was even brash enough to show that fact in presentations to investors. The report even notes that one of SBF’s aids “tweaked” accounting software that allowed him to hide the fact he was transferring customer funds between FTX and Alameda.

So he may want to make customers whole, but that may prove a hard bargain considering that court documents released this week show the number of creditors that FTX owes could be over 1 million."

3cdb3d50-0e68-44f4-be29-82f6592776ac,"New York Times Runs Bizarre Softball Article on FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried

FTX filed for bankruptcy on Friday, leaving reasonable people to wonder how a cryptocurrency platform founded in 2019, which reached a valuation of $US32 ($44) billion in 2021, could plummet to zero in such a short time. There’s a new piece in the New York Times which gained exclusive access to FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, but if you’re looking for answers, you’re not going to find it there. In fact, the interview with SBF, as he’s often called, is presented with such a gauzy lens that you have to start wondering what the hell is going on with crypto reporting at the Times.

The new article in the New York Times by David Yaffe-Bellany lays out the facts in ways that are clearly beneficial to SBF’s version of the story and leaves many of his highly questionable assertions without proper context or even the most minimal amount of pushback. The result isn’t to illuminate the shadowy world of crypto. It reads like if the Times had conducted an interview with Bernie Madoff after his ponzi scheme collapsed and ultimately suggested he just made some bad investments.

As one example, take a paragraph near the beginning of the article that quotes SBF’s dealings with hedge fund Alameda Research, the sister organisation of FTX, run by SBF’s sometime romantic partner Caroline Ellison. The paragraph, one of just a few about Alameda, brushes past all the most important facts that have been reported by outlets like Reuters, Bloomberg News, and the Financial Times.

From the New York Times:

Alameda had accumulated a large “margin position” on FTX, essentially meaning it had borrowed funds from the exchange, Mr. Bankman-Fried said. “It was substantially larger than I had thought it was,” he said. “And in fact the downside risk was very significant.” He said the size of the position was in the billions of dollars but declined to provide further details.

SBF’s quote about “borrowing” billions between FTX and Alameda seems to be a wild mischaracterization, if we’re to believe reliable reporting by numerous other outlets, and paints the corporate three-card-Monte as some kind of innocent investment move gone wrong. At least $US4 ($6) billion of FTX funds, including customer deposits, were moved to prop up Alameda, according to Reuters, and that’s just something you can’t do legally.

The billionaire CEO of Citadel, Ken Griffin, explained just today at a conference in Singapore why moving money in this way isn’t allowed in traditional finance.

“There’s no doubt that customer assets were used to make investment decisions in favour of FTX’s shareholders, which didn’t work, at the expense of the customers. That’s not permitted in American broker dealers. You can’t just use your customer assets to go engage in proprietary trading,” Griffin explained in an interview with Bloomberg News.

“That’s a huge no-no. And that’s a good no-no, to be clear, too,” Griffin continued.

As another example, take a paragraph where the Times discusses FTX’s relationship with Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance:

A former investor in FTX, Mr. Zhao still owned a large amount of FTT, a cryptocurrency that FTX invented to facilitate trading on its platform. On Nov. 6, Mr. Zhao announced on Twitter that he was selling the FTT, spooking customers who rushed to withdraw their FTX deposits.

There’s a lot going on in this paragraph but let’s start with the claim that FTT was a cryptocurrency that was “invented to facilitate trading.” That’s a very crypto-industry-friendly way of talking about what was happening. In reality, FTT was created by SBF for the same reason that any other cryptocurrency has been created: as a speculative asset that allows early investors to extract wealth from people who place money into the asset after the price has soared.

The Times piece also mentions Zhao’s announced sale of FTT token last week, without explaining why the sale itself was a problem. Zhao had acquired the FTT coins in a strange way and wanted to offload it. It started when Zhao bought a 20% interest in FTX back in 2019. After Zhao’s relationship with SBF soured in mid-2021, SBF bought out Zhao’s share in FTX for $US2 ($3) billion. But a huge chunk of that $US2 ($3) billion was in FTT, the token invented by SBF. When Zhao announced he was selling all his FTT, $US580 ($805) million worth according to Reuters, the entire house of cards came crashing down.

Earlier in the piece, the Times calls what happened to FTX a “run on deposits,” a characterization that obscures what really occurred. It’s not clear that FTX even had $US580 ($805) million liquid enough to cash out just Zhao’s share in a cryptocurrency token that was only invented three years ago. If you fail to explain what FTT actually was, you can’t understand why it was arguably the largest fraud of the past decade.

FTX held just $US900 ($1,249) million in liquid assets, and its largest single asset was a cryptocurrency called Serum, according to the Financial Times. FTX held $US2 ($3).2 billion worth of Serum, but the market value of all Serum everywhere was just $US88 ($122) million. And you’re never going to guess who created Serum. Much like FTT, Serum was created by FTX and Alameda, according to Bloomberg News. The people behind FTX created their own fake money and they were treating it as though it was real dollars and cents.

But every single explanation in the new Times piece gives both SBF and cryptocurrency more broadly the benefit of the doubt, using the former billionaire’s quotes extensively, and even trying to position his attitude as one of self-reflection rather than ruthless calculation to make himself sound better.

Another excerpt from the Times:

Mr. Bankman-Fried did, however, agree with critics in the crypto community who said he had expanded his business interests too quickly across a wide swath of the industry. He said his other commitments had led him to miss signs that FTX was running into trouble. “Had I been a bit more concentrated on what I was doing, I would have been able to be more thorough,” he said. “That would have allowed me to catch what was going on on the risk side.”

Did SBF “expanded his business interests too quickly” in some way? Did SBF just not “catch what was going on” with the risks he was taking? Or was the entire venture rotten to its core?

Paragraph after paragraph in the Times gives a gentle light to FTX’s extraordinary implosion, explaining that SBF’s “ambitions exceeded his grasp” or speculating that perhaps he was “overly dependent” on a small group of advisors.

And, according to the Times, SBF’s lean staff count wasn’t further evidence that it was all just smoke and mirrors, but rather something to be proud of, along with his charitable contributions:

Mr. Bankman-Fried’s circle of colleagues was bound by a commitment to effective altruism, a charitable movement that urges adherents to give away their wealth in efficient and logical ways. For co-workers outside the clique, it was sometimes difficult to get time speaking with Mr. Bankman Fried, a person familiar with the matter said. And Mr. Bankman-Fried made it a point of pride that FTX had only about a 300-person staff, much smaller than its top rivals, Binance and Coinbase. Even as he kept hiring down, Mr. Bankman-Fried built an ambitious philanthropic operation, invested in dozens of other crypto companies, bought stock in the trading firm Robinhood, donated to political campaigns, gave media interviews and offered Elon Musk billions of dollars to help finance the mogul’s Twitter takeover. Mr. Bankman-Fried said he wished “we’d bitten off a lot less.”

Again, this characterization from SBF makes it sound as if he just overextended himself in an otherwise reputable venture. In reality, SBF had built a house of cards “where each individual card is itself a house of cards,” as Rusty Foster put it yesterday.

Even the glaring conflicts of interest made obvious in the FTX downfall are only pointed out as something that SBF’s “critics” would mention:

FTX and Alameda were closely linked. Alameda traded heavily on the FTX platform, meaning it sometimes benefited when FTX’s other customers lost money, a dynamic that critics called a conflict of interest. In the past, Mr. Bankman-Fried has defended the arrangement, saying Alameda provided crucial liquidity — injections of capital that enabled others customers to complete transactions on the exchange.

And, at the end of the day, SBF just wants to cooperate with investigators and do what’s right for the people who put their money into FTX, according to the Times, which quotes SBF uncritically:

As FTX has crumbled, Mr. Bankman-Fried has been “working constructively with regulators, bankruptcy officials and the company to try to do what’s best for consumers,” he said on Sunday.

To top it all off, the Times article never addresses the fact that FTX was allegedly “hacked” over the weekend to the tune of roughly $US600 ($833) million. Not even a passing mention of this very bizarre thing that will surely have a big impact on the bankruptcy proceedings moving forward.

The Times piece ends with a mention of SBF’s love of video games and his bizarre social media antics over the past two days:

“People can say all the mean things they want about me online,” he said. “In the end, what’s going to matter to me is what I’ve done and what I can do.” He has also found other ways to occupy his time in recent days, playing the video game Storybook Brawl, though less than he usually does, he said. “It helps me unwind a bit,” he said. “It clears my mind.” Shortly before the interview, Mr. Bankman-Fried had posted a cryptic tweet: the word “What.” Then he had tweeted the letter H. Asked to explain, Mr. Bankman-Fried said he planned to post the letter A and then the letter P. “It’s going to be more than one word,” he said. “I’m making it up as I go.” So he was planning a series of cryptic tweets? “Something like that.” But why? “I don’t know,” he said. “I’m improvising. I think it’s time.”

The Times piece has been met with a disgusted reaction on social media, as people try to make sense of how someone who lost literally billions of dollars from FTX users could just be treated as an innocent businessman whose worst crime may have been some bad trades. But the SEC and DOJ are both investigating FTX, according to the Wall Street Journal, so even if the Times has decided to go easy on SBF, at least there’s hope some justice will be served at some point in the future."
4d6721f3-ecad-43a3-b9b6-7b20019bfd24,"FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried says he expanded his business too fast and failed to notice signs of trouble at the exchange, whose downfall sent shock waves through the crypto industry, the New York Times reports.

""Had I been a bit more concentrated on what I was doing, I would have been able to be more thorough,"" the former FTX chief executive said in an interview with the newspaper.

FTX filed for bankruptcy on Friday, one of the highest-profile crypto blowups, after traders rushed to withdraw $US6 billion ($A8.96 billion) from the platform in just 72 hours and rival exchange Binance abandoned a proposed rescue deal.

The US Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are now all investigating how FTX handled customer funds, a source told Reuters.

Bankman-Fried, who is based in the Bahamas, declined to comment on his current location, citing safety concerns, the newspaper said.

When asked whether FTX used customer funds to prop up the trading firm Alameda Research that he founded, Bankman-Fried told the New York Times that Alameda had accumulated a large ""margin position"" on FTX.

""It was substantially larger than I had thought it was,"" he said and added without providing details that the size of the position was in the billions.

Reuters reported last week that Bankman-Fried had secretly transferred $US10 billion of customer funds from FTX to Alameda."
26630db9-4652-4ff1-b89b-b98954981e92,"He’s now attempting to raise $8 billion in financing to make customers whole. What that will look like is anybody’s guess, (Bankman-Fried did not respond to a request for comment). But the sum is far greater than the company, once valued at $32 billion and now going through Chapter 11 bankruptcy, ever raised. SBF has also resigned as CEO."
e34cf568-7dd9-436c-b41a-b99514849eaa,"Until last week, Sam Bankman-Fried - or SBF as he’s become known - was crypto’s poster-child. He was a regular in Washington, DC where he schmoozed journalists, regulators and lawmakers alike. He funded political campaigns and sponsored sports teams ranging from basketball to Formula One. For many, the floppy-haired, 30-year-old once-billionaire wasn’t just the face of his crypto trading firm FTX, he was the face of crypto. But last week, SBJ’s business, which was valued at $32bn at the start of the year, collapsed into bankruptcy and now he is being investigated by regulators and law-enforcement agencies.

On this week’s “Money Talks”, hosts Alice Fulwood and Soumaya Keynes ask whether the crypto phenomenon can survive the loss of a figurehead. They speak with Alesia Haas, the CFO of the second-largest exchange Coinbase. And hear from some of the recipients of SBF’s contributions to the effective altruism movement about what’s next.

An increasing number of retirees are living beyond their means this year, according to a recent survey from the Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI).

More than a quarter (27%) of retirees are ""spending much higher or a little higher than they can afford"" in 2022, the Spending in Retirement Survey said. That’s up from 17% in 2020.

More retirees have also reported increasing their spending since 2020. This year, 27% of respondents said they have increased their essential spending, while 12% reported increasing their discretionary spending. That’s up from 2020, when 23% of respondents said they increased their essential spending and 8% said they increased their discretionary spending.

Meanwhile, 46% of retirees said they decreased either their essential or discretionary spending this year, according to the survey. Of those respondents, 87% said that concerns about inflation led them to cut back – the most common reason listed in the survey.

""Inflation appears to be a major driver of the misalignment between expectations and reality, a double-edged sword that undoubtedly increases actual spending but also reduces spending, likely out of a desire to protect future purchasing power,"" Bridget Bearden, Ph.D., who is a research and development strategist for EBRI, said in a statement.

If you are struggling amid high inflation, a personal loan can help you pay down debt at a lower interest rate, reducing your monthly payments. You can visit Credible to compare multiple lenders and find the best option for you.

SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL COLA INCREASES IN 2023, BUT IS IT ENOUGH FOR RETIREES?

Social Security beneficiaries receive COLA increase for 2023

About 70% of respondents in the EBRI survey said that Social Security is a major source of their retirement income. And that income will increase early next year.

The Social Security Administration (SSA) announced in October that Social Security recipients will see an 8.7% increase in benefits – equating to an average boost of $140 per month – starting in 2023. This will impact roughly 70 million Americans.

The cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) – which is the highest since 1981 – was determined by inflation levels, particularly the Consumer Price Index (CPI). In September, the CPI increased by 8.2% annually, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). In October, the CPI slowed slightly and increased by 7.7% annually.

Though it might seem like a ""raise,"" the COLA increase is meant to help retirees keep up with inflation, Kelly LaVigne, Allianz Life vice president of consumer insights, said in a statement.

""Miscalculating how much you can depend on Social Security benefits can have a detrimental effect on your financial health throughout retirement,"" LaVigne said.

Other ways to save in retirement

Retirees who want to avoid spending more than they can afford without sacrificing their current lifestyle may want to consider these tips.

Cut down on housing costs

For retirees, housing expenses take up the largest percentage of their monthly spending, according to the EBRI survey. Respondents said they spend an average of 30% of their income on housing.

There are several ways that retirees can reduce their housing costs, including downsizing to a less expensive home or moving to an area where the cost of living and property taxes are lower, according to U.S. News & World Report. Retirees who move into a smaller home are also likely to save on utility bills, the outlet reported.

Other ways to cut housing costs include renting out a room or basement apartment, rent out storage space in your garage or shed or reduce landscaping expenses with a low-maintenance yard.

Refinancing your mortgage may also help you – but only if it ends up saving you money in the long run. That usually means lowering your interest rate by at least 1%. And make sure to factor in closing costs as well.

If you’re interested in a mortgage refinance, you can visit Credible to check mortgage refinance rates from multiple lenders without affecting your credit.

Use senior discounts – including on insurance

Another way retirees can save money is to find out if they qualify for senior discounts, according to U.S. News & World Report.

Though many places offer lower prices for seniors, some discounts aren’t publicized, so make sure to ask.

Senior drivers can also ask their auto insurance carrier about discounts on their policy. Some providers offer incentives such as low-mileage discounts, safe driving discounts and discounts from taking additional driving courses.

Pay off outstanding high-interest credit card debt

Credit card debt was the most common type of debt held by retirees, according to the EBRI survey. Forty percent of respondents reported having outstanding credit card debt.

Retirees with high-interest credit card debt may want to consolidate their debt or pay it off with a personal loan at a lower interest rate.

You can visit Credible to compare debt consolidation options and find the best personal loan rates for your financial situation.

Allocating a higher percentage of your salary toward retirement is an effective pathway to grow your savings – and improve your shot at financing your post-work life.

But is that true for investors in their 50s? Can folks in middle age significantly impact their retirement outlook at the eleventh hour of their careers?

To answer those questions, SmartAsset crunched the numbers.

We looked at three sample savers. They all have the same amount saved at age 50, but each makes a different decision about whether to increase savings at that point.

What we found: It’s never too late to ramp up your retirement savings. (And if you’re looking for help planning for retirement, consider working with a financial advisor.)

For a look at the data, read on.

Our Analysis

SmartAsset analyzed three sample retirement portfolios.

In each example, a 50-year-old retiree starts with $61,530, which is the median retirement account balance for folks between the ages of 45 and 54, according to Vanguard’s “How America Saves 2022” report.

All retirees invest pretax money in a diversified fund returning 5% and earn $83,812 pre-tax, which is the median household income for folks between the ages of 45 and 64, according to the Census Bureau’s 2021 1-year American Community Survey. For the sake of simplicity, their household income doesn’t change during the final 15 years of their working lives.

When it comes to saving habits, their behaviors diverge.

Saver A is the least enthusiastic saver. He squirrels away 3% of his $83,812 household income and earns a 3% employer match. That equates to a $419 monthly contribution (including both employee and employer contributions). He doesn’t change his percentage savings rate during the final 15 years of his working life.

Saver B decides to ramp up savings slowly. He starts with a 3% contribution, plus a 3% employer match, then increases his savings by a percentage point each year until retirement. By the time he reaches 65, he is funneling 17% of his income toward retirement. His contributions start at $419 per month and end at $1,397 at 65.

Story continues

Saver C is a super-saver. He directs 20% of his household income to a retirement account starting at age 50 and earns a 3% employer match. That is a $1,606 monthly contribution for 15 years.

Running the Numbers

Saver A, the 3 percenter, is the least aggressive saver. His $419 monthly contribution swells his retirement account to $239,346 by age 65. That’s still more than a quarter million dollars, but his peers saved more.

Saver B, the slow-but-steady saver, sees his retirement account grow to $352,583 by age 65. That’s $113,237 more than Saver A saves, or about 30% more. That difference can help fund a more robust, longer retirement for Saver B.

Saver C, our super-saver, makes up for the lost time. His account reaches $555,063. That’s $200,000 more than Saver B socks away and more than double Saver A’s nest egg. With more savings, Saver C is less likely to outlive his retirement savings. A larger account can also improve his lifestyle in retirement and even augment the odds that he’ll be able to leave a legacy to his heirs.

5 Ways to Save More for Retirement

The numbers show that it’s possible to make a significant difference in your retirement account, even if you don’t start seriously saving until your 50s.

But, of course, it’s easier to talk about saving more than it is to actually do it. Some strategies to get started include these:

1. Think small. If raising your retirement savings from 3% to 20% in a single year is intimidating, start small like Saver B did. Even an increase of a percentage point in your salary per year can have a significant impact on your total savings over time.

2. Bank your tax refund. Small windfalls such as tax refunds can pad out a retirement account and increase your savings percentage for the year.

3. Allocate a percentage of your raise. The savers in this example never got a raise, but imagine the difference if they had one each year. Consider redirecting a percentage of any annual raise or bonus to your retirement savings accounts.

4. Secure your match. Each of these retirees took advantage of their employer’s 401(k) match. Not doing so is like leaving free money on the table. Make sure you’re funneling enough into your account to claim any workplace match.

5. Focus on your strategy. When times get tough, it’s helpful to remind yourself of your strategy and not make gut decisions. A financial advisor may be able to help you identify an investing and saving strategy that produces retirement income.

Bottom Line

The earlier you can start saving for retirement, the better. But if you’re starting late, take note that you can make a difference in your savings by increasing the amount you invest and staying consistent.

Retirement Planning Tips

Planning for retirement can feel like solving a complicated puzzle, but you don't have to go at it alone. A financial advisor can help you put the right pieces together by assessing your needs and connecting you with the services that are right for you. Finding a qualified financial advisor doesn’t have to be hard. SmartAsset’s free tool matches you with up to three financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you. If you’re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.

Social Security plays a critical role in the retirement plans of many. By delaying Social Security beyond your full retirement age, you can increase your benefit up to 8% per year until age 70. SmartAsset's Social Security calculator can help you determine the best time to claim your benefits.

Nov 15 (Reuters) - Michael Barr, the Federal Reserve's top financial regulatory official, on Tuesday said he is concerned about risks from the non-bank sector, including cryptocurrencies, for which the U.S. central bank and other regulators have poor visibility.

""We're concerned about the risks that we don't know about in the non-bank sector,"" Barr said in response to a question during an appearance before the Senate Banking Committee. ""That includes obviously crypto activity, but more broadly risks in parts of the financial system where we don't have good visibility, we don't have good transparency, we don't have good data. That can create risks that blow back to the financial system that we do regulate.""

Barr's remarks came in his first congressional testimony since becoming the Fed's top Wall Street cop over the summer and augmented his prepared comments to the committee that he was keeping a close eye for stresses in the financial system amid a weakening economy.

He had also signaled stiffer oversight of the cryptocurrency arena is in the offing, an issue that has taken on added urgency with the collapse last week of crypto-exchange FTX, which filed for bankruptcy on Friday. Panicked traders had yanked some $6 billion from the platform in 72 hours and a rival exchange abandoned a rescue deal.

Recent events in crypto markets, Barr said in his written testimony, ""while mostly occurring outside the banking sector, have highlighted the risks to investors and consumers associated with new and novel asset classes and activities when not accompanied by strong guardrails.""

""We do not want to stifle innovation, but when regulation is lax or behind the curve, it can facilitate risk taking and a race to the bottom that puts consumers, businesses, and the economy in danger and discredits new products and services with consumers and investors.""

That said, Barr said market regulators were in a better position to provide an initial regulatory framework for the crypto sector.

""The market regulators are ... the first place to start in this space,"" Barr said in response to a senator's question. ""They have existing authorities. We want to make sure those are fully utilized. Some of the activity that was going on in this space was purporting to go on in a way that was designed to evade supervision and regulation. I think we've seen the enormous human costs of that kind of activity.""

QUESTIONS ABOUT CRYPTO CUSTODY

Barr and other top regulators from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency appearing before the committee were pressed by Senator Patrick Toomey, the panel's ranking Republican, for why they have not issued guidance to banks about forming relationships, such as custody services, with crypto firms that could foster greater oversight of the sector.

Toomey voiced concern that the Fed was signaling it may issue guidance to banks wishing to provide custody services for crypto assets to place those assets on their own balance sheets, which would increase their capital requirements. Banks are not required to place other types of custody assets on their own balance sheets.

""Wouldn't this impose a significant cost on banks if they are in fact obligated to put all of the ... crypto custody assets on their balance sheets?"" Toomey asked Barr.

""We've seen banks operate in a pretty cautious way to date. There are very few institutions that are currently seeking to engage in custody activity,"" Barr said. He said his understanding of recent Securities and Exchange Commission accounting interpretations for publicly traded banks was that banks would need to hold capital against crypto assets held in custody in a way not required for traditional custody assets.

""So that differential would impact bank decision making,"" he said.

NOT IN RECESSION BUT ECONOMY SOFTENING

Barr, who is also a monetary policymaker with a permanent vote on Fed interest rate decisions, said a weakening outlook for the economy was another key risk to the financial system as the central bank lifts interest rates to fight inflation that is, in his view, ""far too high.""

""I think that it's the case we are going to see significant softening in the economy,"" Barr told lawmakers, although he declined to offer a specific forecast for how high the U.S. unemployment rate may rise. Later he added, ""there is not a recession right now. We're in a period of slower economic growth.""

Since March, the Fed has raised its benchmark interest rate from near zero to a range of 3.75% to 4.00%, including four straight increases of three-quarters of a percentage point. Rate increases are likely to continue into early 2023, though are seen slowing in their pace from here amid some promising signs that inflation pressures have begun easing.

Still, the tighter financial conditions engineered by the Fed pose risks for banks, Barr said.

""A weaker economy could put stress on households and businesses and, thus, on the banking system as a whole.""

2ba74998-9d12-4c6a-bf66-3cd46008c217,"Treasurer Jim Chalmers last month said the annual cost of stage three had increased by about $1 billion more than expected, though this is largely due to workers paying more after moving into higher tax brackets.

The IMF said Australia was on a narrow path to a soft economic landing, but called for higher interest rates, ongoing fiscal discipline and major tax reform to buttress the economy.

The global lender forecast economic growth to slow from 3.7 per cent this year to just 1.7 per cent in 2023-24, due to higher interest rates, persistent inflation, weakening export demand, and declining housing prices.

And it warned that a deeper plunge in global growth than forecast, more persistent inflation, and a faster-than-expected decline in house prices could push the economy off course.

“Australia is expected to steer clear of a recession, but with significant downside risks,” the IMF said.

The lender called for the Reserve Bank of Australia to continue lifting the cash rate, which has climbed from 0.1 per cent in May to 2.85 per cent this month, with economists forecasting a peak between 3.6–3.85 per cent. It also warned of the need to maintain discipline on government spending.

“The RBA should continue to raise interest rates, and fiscal policy should support it in moderating domestic demand growth through judicious budget execution and saving of any revenue over performance.

“High inflation, the positive output gap, and the very tight labor market necessitate monetary and fiscal policy tightening,” but added that policy needed to remain nimble in the current uncertain environment.

The IMF expects underlying inflation – the RBA’s preferred measure – to remain elevated above 3 per cent until the end of 2024 due to energy and transport costs, as well as due to rising nominal wages.

“Acute pressures on the labor market are likely to continue in the near term, with some upward pressure on wages,” the lender said.

Reform tax, reign in spending

On the fiscal side, the IMF welcomed the Albanese government’s restraint in the October budget, prompting Treasurer Jim Chalmers to label the report a “ringing endorsement” of his first federal budget.

“It highlights the government’s spending restraint and responsible approach to revenue upgrades won’t add to inflationary pressures in the economy... This is a strong endorsement of our economic policies.”

The IMF also reiterated calls to overhaul Australia’s tax system to strengthen economic efficiency and public revenue, and rein in spending on things like the National Disability Insurance Scheme.

Tax reform should include a transition from currently high direct taxes to underutilised indirect taxes, with the regressive impacts mitigated by targeted cash payments to vulnerable households.

Long-standing recommendations from the IMF include broadening the base of the GST and removing exemptions, restricting the capital gains tax exemption for the sale of main residences, and helping states and territories scrap stamp duties in favour of broad-based land taxes.

The IMF also warned major off-budget programs such as the $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund, the Rewiring the Nation Program, and the Housing Australia Future Fund should be “phased judiciously, and, more broadly, a proliferation of such vehicles should be avoided.”

It also said spending growth in the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) – forecast to cost $115 billion a year by the end of the decade – healthcare, and aged care were a risk to fiscal consolidation and reduced capacity for other priority spending.

“Designing reform options to strengthen their efficiency and contain cost growth would help provide space for other priority spending and faster fiscal consolidation to rebuild buffers for future shocks.”"

If investment firm Deutsche Bank's forecasts hold true, Australia will enter a recession next year.

However, the bank has not worked with the accepted definition of ""technical recession"" to produce its forecast.

A recession is traditionally defined as two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth (GDP).

Instead, Deutsche Bank looked at where it believes the unemployment rate is heading.

It expects Australia's unemployment rate will spike higher next year, as the economy slows.

""We expect Australia's unemployment rate to end 2023 at 4.5 per cent, that is, one percentage point higher than the current unemployment rate at 3.5 per cent,"" Deutsche Bank chief economist Phil O'Donoghoe said.

The RBA's unemployment rate forecast for the end of 2023 is significantly below that at 3.7 per cent.

""If our forecast is realised, that would qualify as a recession on our definition, even if — as our forecasts assume – gross domestic product (GDP) avoids two consecutive quarters of negative growth,"" he said.

""We have long considered that 'technical' recession definition singularly unhelpful for Australia.

""From a welfare perspective, a one percentage point rise in the unemployment rate within a year is a far more useful description,"" Mr O'Donoghoe argued.

Labour market economist Leonora Risse disagreed.

She does not think that referencing a large increase in the unemployment rate is reasonable way to measure an economic recession.

""A recession means going backwards,"" Dr Risse said.

""So economists think of recessions as the economy slowing down so much that economic activity is actually declining, and total economic activity is less than it was in the previous quarter.

""Technically we need to see two quarters of consecutive negative growth in GDP for the economy to be officially classified as being in recession.

""It's possible to see a rise in the unemployment rate, but for the economy not to have slowed down to the extent that it's in a recession.""

So, what could drive unemployment higher?

Much depends on how shoppers or consumers respond to the already announced interest rate increases by the Reserve Bank.

""Consumer spending has been supported by past gains in incomes, asset prices and accumulated savings during the pandemic,"" Reserve Bank deputy governor Michele Bullock noted in a speech earlier this month.

""However, these sources of support are being eroded to some extent by high inflation, rising interest rates and falling housing prices, and this is expected to contribute to a slowing in consumption growth from early next year.""

Deutsche Bank's forecasts highlight the economy's dependency on ongoing robust consumer demand.

""At face value, the shock to household financial obligations that is already underway points to significant downside risks to the RBA's consumption forecasts,"" Mr O'Donoghoe said

""But households can draw on pent-up COVID savings to smooth consumption.

""We expect they will do that, the question is by how much?""

One driver of economic growth missing from the economy in recent years has been strong wages growth.

The government is currently trying to pass its industrial relations bill through the Senate.

Part of the bill is a proposal to widen access to multi-employer bargaining — a form of enterprise bargaining that sees employees from within an industry band together to negotiate higher pay.

The Reserve Bank is in the midst of its most aggressive tightening of monetary policy since 1994, lifting official interest rates from 0.1 per cent to 2.85 per cent since May. Markets expect another rate rise at the RBA’s December meeting with the cash rate tipped to reach 3.6 per cent by the middle of 2023.

The fund said the Australian economy had been among the strongest in the developed world, but growth would likely slow next year to about 1.7 per cent because of global and local headwinds."

Recession Unlikely in Australia, Says IMF

The International Monetary Fund expects Australia to dodge a recession but has downgraded its expectations for growth next year.

The United Nations agency anticipates growth slowing to 1.7 per cent in 2023—less than the 1.9 per cent forecast in its world economic outlook released last month.

In its annual health check on the Australian economy, the IMF pointed to Australia’s resilient domestic buffers to economic headwinds, including decent household savings.

“Between the slowing global growth and some still-resilient domestic buffers, Australia is on a narrow path for a soft landing,” the report said.

But Australia is not out of the woods—a larger-than-expected slowdown in China’s growth would put the nation’s exports at risk, and higher inflation and wage growth domestically could prompt further interest rate rises from the central bank.

“The decline in housing prices has the potential to accelerate, which can reduce household consumption, with some impact on banks’ balance sheets,” the IMF warned.

The agency urged the Reserve Bank to keep lifting interest rates to cool demand and called on the government to keep spending constrained and targeted.

Treasurer Jim Chalmers said the IMF confirmed the Albanese government had delivered a budget “right for the times” in October.

“The government is returning 99 percent of the upward tax revisions for the next two years to the budget when the inflation challenge is most severe, and 92 percent over the forward estimates,” Chalmers said.

“This compares to the former government’s average of around 40 percent.”

The international agency also weighed in on Australia’s tax reform debate—noting the stage three tax cuts would reduce the personal income tax burden and Australia would be best to double down on “under-utilised” indirect taxes, such as property taxes and the goods and services tax.

“Longstanding recommendations include broadening the GST base to limit exemptions for healthcare spending and restricting the capital gains tax exemption for the sale of main residences,” the report said.

The IMF also recommended ditching stamp duty in favour of land taxes to promote housing affordability, labour mobility and a more sustainable tax base.

The agency welcomed Australia’s renewed commitment to climate mitigation and said more renewables in the grid would improve the resilience of the electricity sector and insulate the country from price spikes and energy market volatility.

While recognising the political challenges, the IMF said an economy-wide carbon price was the most effective way to cut emissions.

Despite Australia’s resilience to economic turmoil, a new report shows small businesses are starting to suffer.

CreditorWatch’s business risk index found small businesses were three times more likely to be falling behind on payments than big businesses.

Business-to-business payment defaults also continue to rise at an average rate of 20 percent each month.

CreditorWatch chief economist Anneke Thompson said the rise in trade defaults, depressed consumer confidence and rising job vacancies all pointed to a slowing economy.

“Instinctively, this seems unwanted, but unfortunately, a significant slowdown of the economy is one of the only cures for inflation,” she said.

“The challenge is not allowing small business to suffer the brunt of the impact of a slowing economy, which unfortunately is usually the case.”"

SYDNEY, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Australia should continue to tighten monetary and fiscal policy to contain inflation even as its economy is set to slow sharply next year amid a host of downside risks, including falling house prices, the IMF said on Wednesday.

In its annual review, the IMF also welcomed the new Labor government's strengthened commitment to policies to mitigate climate change, though it recommended adoption of carbon price which would be politically challenging.

The agency noted Australia's economic recovery from the pandemic had been one of the strongest in the developed world with growth of 3.7% expected this year.

However, the IMF forecast that to slow to just 1.7% in 2023/2024 given higher interest rates, persistent inflation, weakening export demand, and declining housing prices.

""Between the slowing global growth and some still-resilient domestic buffers, Australia is on a narrow path for a soft landing,"" the IMF report said.

""Continued monetary and fiscal policy tightening is needed to rebalance domestic demand and keep inflation expectations well anchored.""

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has already raised rates by 275 basis points to a nine-year high of 2.85%, and more was needed in the short term the agency said.

It also counselled the government against providing major cost of living support, arguing fiscal plans should stay on a consolidation path in the face of spending pressures.

The IMF's long list of recommendations included a greater shift toward indirect taxation, more spending on infrastructure and steps to boost the supply of housing.

On climate, the Labor government's new commitment on reducing emissions by 43% by 2030 meant Australia was now on the path to reaching net zero by 2050.

""While politically challenging, an economy-wide carbon price is the most effective way to achieve emission reductions,"" the IMF said.

Australia had a carbon price under a former Labor government but that was axed by the Liberal National coalition when it won power in 2013.

ad22d93d-0fde-4b5a-bfac-0115291cee67,"Every week after I finish writing this newsletter, I think: “Next week I’ll try not to devote the whole email to a single topic. Some variety is always nice, and there are so many other things to write about.”

And then everything keeps happening.

Everything kept happening

Sam Bankman-Fried, “SBF”, was one of the good guys of crypto. He was what everyone wanted a crypto billionaire to be.

A young (30 now, but 25 when he founded his crypto hedge fund Alameda Research), visionary (his desire to earn more, he said, was only because it would enable him to donate to good causes), genius (an MIT undergraduate, gifted high-school mathematician, would wow investors on a Zoom call while playing video games in another tab).

SBF cared about doing things right – he worked with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to draw up model legislation for regulating the cryptocurrency sector – and he tried to use his money to improve the world. He promised a billion dollars to the Democratic party, committed to donating vast amounts of his fortune to the “effective altruism” movement, underwrote essay prizes and evangelised for philanthropy. He even managed to keep his good name as the crypto crash started to bite. Where others might have been able to siphon off profit from retail investors, he bought up the shattered remains of consumer-facing non-banks and promised to protect their consumer deposits.

SBF didn’t have a string of failed companies behind him; he hadn’t built his riches by launching dubious assets and riding a speculative wave to wealth. Instead, he’d managed a career that seemed as close to conventional finance as you could get in the crypto industry. Start with a hedge fund: executing smart and cautious trades to spot market behaviour that can be pushed for a profit. His famous first trade was an attempt to close the “kimchi premium”, the persistent difference between bitcoin prices in Korea and America. Profiting is less about noticing it – the differences are plain as day – and more about solving the logistical hurdles: can you get real money from Korea to America, buy bitcoin in the US, sell it at a profit in Korea and repeat it? Can you do it quickly? Can you do it without your accounts being frozen, without being arrested for suspected money laundering and without breaking capital controls?

Then grow your fund until you’re big enough that you can start to make money simply by being the largest player willing to commit big sums to crypto. The hedge fund became famous for “yield farming” – profiting from crypto assets that promise a pseudo interest rate to those who hold them – and scale begat scale. He then launched a crypto exchange, because why gamble in the casino when you can run one? Well two, technically: one exchange in the Bahamas, where trading strategies can be attempted unencumbered by American regulation, and one in the US, where a much stricter set of rules allow crypto novices an on-ramp to the sector, sending cash direct from their bank account.

When you’re running the exchange, you can step even further back from the unseemly coalface of crypto, profiting merely by taking fees from other people, and cashing in on your strong and stable reputation. FTX was, by some measures, the second largest in the world, and although its offshore nature meant it could never claim to be the cleanest of all the options, it stood in contrast to the larger Binance, run by the more pugnacious Changpeng Zhao (another initialism, known as CZ) who seems still to revel in the ungovernable nature of the sector in a way that SBF never publicly did.

But it was a castle built on sand.

‘I fucked up’

From the outside, the crisis started last week, when CZ took to Twitter to lend credence to some rumours that had been doing the rounds. A document, purporting to be the accounts of Alameda, the SBF-founded hedge fund, had leaked. It showed that the hedge fund’s solvency rested, to the tune of several billion dollars, on a token called FTT – the FTX token.

But FTT was just a bet on the solvency of FTX. The token, which was launched and controlled by FTX, was effectively a share in the company: FTX committed to spending a portion of its profits to periodically buy back some FTT, meaning that the richer FTX, the more valuable FTT should be. And the accounts suggested that SBF was printing Disney dollars at one of his companies, and using them to finance the activity of another of them. CZ announced Binance would be selling the FTT, crashing the price of the token in the process.

The short Twitter thread sparked a bank run. On Sunday 6 November, depositors fled to withdraw money from FTX. On Monday, they continued. On Tuesday, the exchange stopped returning funds. The end was in sight. FTX tried to sell itself, turning to Binance and offering a deal that would protect those depositors. But Binance balked, looking at the company’s books and walking from the deal.

In a series of emotional posts on Twitter, SBF said he had “fucked up”. His problem, he claimed, was a liquidity issue, not a solvency one: if someone asks you to repay a loan, and you need a week to sell your house, you are illiquid. If someone asks you to repay a loan, and your house has just fallen into the sea, you are insolvent. All liquidity issues become solvency ones if the crisis is fast enough; if someone asks you to repay a loan in the next five minutes, and you have to sell your house for cash to the first person to walk past your front door, you probably don’t get the full value of your house. The exchange was over. “I fucked up twice,” he wrote.

The billion-dollar hole might be just the beginning

But over the weekend, as the full picture of SBF’s empire emerged, it became clear that the problems did not start this week, nor even this month.

A sprawling group of more than 100 related parties, it will take months to fully unpick what the companies collectively known as FTX did and didn’t own. But one thing that has become clear remarkably early is that they had far, far less than anyone thought.

On Saturday, the Financial Times published a leaked spreadsheet, put together by FTX on Thursday, listing the company’s assets and liabilities. The document showed that the company had less than $1bn in liquid assets, against almost $9bn liabilities, backing up reports from Reuters earlier in the week that SBF had been telling people the company needed $8 to $10bn of inward investment to protect depositors.

The sheet, written in the first person by SBF, was an attempt at vindication, but it just damned the company further. “There were many things I wish I could do differently than I did,” he wrote, “but the largest are represented by these two things: the poorly labelled internal bank-related account, and the size of customer withdrawals during a run on the bank.”

Without the $8bn hole, and without the $5bn withdrawals on Sunday, the company did look as if it was in better shape: with more than 20 times a normal day’s withdrawals on hand, SBF pointed out, rather than the 4 times a normal day that the $8bn hole left, and barely a fifth of what was taken out on Sunday. But other problems were clear. The company’s investments were figments. One of the biggest was a token called Serum, valued at more than $2bn on the sheet. But the total value of all Serum in existence has never broken $200m, and today is a quarter of that.

Instead, the valuation (listed as “less liquid” on the sheet) appears to be a calculation based on the “fully diluted market capital”, effectively, the value of the token plus all future dividends, which wouldn’t be hit for decades. But the value of Serum isn’t simply overinflated on the sheet: it’s a questionable token for FTX to list in a sheet of assets at all. Ultimately, the value of the token rests on the trust of the organisation that has the power to create it. And the keys to mint new Serum are held by FTX.

There’s more to the collapse of FTX, like the “hack” that withdrew half a billion dollars just as accounts were frozen, or the hundreds of millions of dollars withdrawn afterwards due to an order from the Bahamian regulators that the regulators then said didn’t exist, but everything keeps happening, so we’ll cover it as it does.

The one constant in digital assets right now is fear and its latest object is Crypto.com, an exchange whose sponsorship of sports like Formula One racing and the soccer World Cup have popularized its brand.

The anxiety stems from a question that barreled out of the disorderly collapse into bankruptcy of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto exchange FTX: namely, who is really safe? Such worries, well-founded or not, contributed to a $1 billion slide in Crypto.com’s native token Cronos in the past week.

The platform’s Chief Executive Officer Kris Marszalek took pains Monday to reassure customers, saying in a live-streamed briefing that its balance sheet is “very strong” and reserves cover all client assets.

“People are depositing, people are withdrawing, people are trading,” he said. “There is pretty much normal activity, just at a heightened level.”

Hanging over the event was the revelation that the exchange in October accidentally transferred and then recovered almost $400 million of the token Ether. Earlier in the year, Crypto.com sent about A$10.5 million ($7 million) to a woman in Melbourne by mistake and is seeking to get the funds back.

Such twists are harder to stomach when the crypto sector is asking whether retail and institutional investors alike will desert in droves following the chaotic toppling of FTX and its sister trading house Alameda Research.

“Crypto.com appears to be experiencing a high volume of withdrawals, which it is handling without any issues,” said Hayden Hughes, chief executive of social-trading platform Alpha Impact. He added that in the wake of FTX many people are looking to take custody of their own funds.

Story continues

No Loans

Marszalek reiterated that Crypto.com has 70 million users and less than $10 million exposure to FTX. He also said that the Cronos token is never used as collateral for loans. The coin climbed in the wake of the briefing, pushing it to a gain of about 4% in the past 24 hours as of 11:30 a.m. in London, based on CoinGecko data.

The coin is the eponymously named utility token on the Cronos blockchain. Holders of the token enjoy loyalty and usage bonuses like discounted trading fees. Its market value has plunged to less than $2 billion from a peak of more than $22 billion at the height of the digital-asset craze in November last year, according CoinGecko.

Crypto.com, like many other exchanges and investors operating in the sector, has been buffeted this year’s deep rout in virtual coins and is among companies that have reduced their workforce.

The exchange, whose app is available in a range of countries, shot to popularity after an advertising campaign fronted by Matt Damon. Apart from sponsoring motor racing and the FIFA soccer World Cup in Qatar, it also acquired the naming rights for the Staples Center -- home to the Los Angeles Lakers and Clippers -- and restyled it as the Crypto.com Arena.

Marszalek has previously said that he expects to release an audited “proof of reserves” in coming days to show that customer assets are intact. Pledges of such releases are multiplying among crypto platforms in an effort to assuage the doubts plaguing the industry.

Mr Bankman-Fried, alongside his executive team Gary Wang and Nishad Singh, are under the supervision of authorities in the Bahamas, where FTX was headquartered.

Hong Kong’s AAX exchange has suspended trading for 10 days, citing the failure of an unidentified third-party partner.

“The FTX situation has put immense pressure in exchanges everywhere with users nervous about exchange holdings,” Ben Caselin, vice president at AAX, said.

“It’s my observation this can be resolved in a few days, although rebuilding market confidence may take months.”

The crypto industry has suffered several high-profile and damaging events this year.

Most notably, the collapse of a crypto-bank called Celsius triggered a savage selloff in May, with investors reeling from the discovery that Celsius had used customer “deposits” to fund its own risky trades.

When investors caught wind of their money being tied up in complex, high-risk trades, they began to withdraw en masse. The resulting bank run left Celsius bankrupt, and triggered the collapse of a widely used algorithmic “stablecoin” called Terra/Luna.

Collapse of inter-linked businesses

Signage for the FTX Arena, where the Miami Heat basketball team plays, is visible Saturday.

With Terra/Luna supposedly worth $US1 on balance sheets, hedge funds such as Singapore-based Three Arrows Capital struggled to plug the hold left by an asset that had tumbled to $0.

Mr Bankman-Fried’s quant firm Alameda Research is understood to have been heavily exposed to Three Arrows Capital and Celsius.

The collapse of these inter-linked businesses is said to have blown up much of Alameda’s balance sheet and prompted the eventual resignation of then co-chief executive Sam Trabucco.

It is then that Mr Bankman-Fried is understood to have supported Alameda’s balance sheet using funds from the FTX exchange.

The failure of crypto businesses to hold enough assets in reserve to combat a “run”, and the knowledge that customer capital is used for for-profit trading, has prompted deep uncertainty across crypto markets.

Over the weekend, bosses of crypto exchanges tried to tackle the scepticism around their liquidity and began to share their “proof of reserves”.

Alongside many others, Crypto.com published its digital asset addresses, revealing how much and what digital assets it stored on behalf of its customers.

But many observers were quick to point out a suspicious transfer of 320,000 ETH ($US400 million) to a wallet address linked to another exchange called Gate.io in October. The transfer was repatriated back to Crypto.com, but chief executive Kris Marszalek said the transaction was a mistake.

“It was supposed to be a move to a new cold storage address, but was sent to a whitelisted external exchange address,” he said.

Cronos, the token underpinning the Crypto.com business, has fallen 25 per cent in the past 24 hours, and 98 per cent of all transactions made on the Cronos blockchain on Monday were withdrawals.

The sharp price fall followed a tweet on Sunday by Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, chief executive of Binance Global, who appeared to direct his comments at the Singapore exchange.

Second transfer mistake

“If an exchange have to move large amounts of crypto before or after they demonstrate their wallet addresses, it is a clear sign of problems. Stay away.”

But this is the second transfer mistake Crypto.com has made.

In August, Crypto.com launched legal action against Melbourne-based investors Manivel and Thilagavathy Gangadory after the pair spent $10.5 million that had been transferred to them in error.

Instead of a $67 refund, Crypto.com mistakenly sent them $US10.5 million, which they then spent on buying property in Victoria.

Investors were not only spooked by the $US400 million error on Monday but they are also questioning how much exposure Crypto.com has to FTX.

Within Crypto.com’s “proof of reserves”, analysts spotted that it holds about $3 billion in stablecoins in its wallets. A stablecoin is a digital asset supposedly pegged to another asset, such as the US dollar.

But on Monday, those analysts revealed that Crypto.com had sent more than $US1 billion ($1.5 billion) worth of stablecoins to FTX over the past 12 months.

In addition to being an exchange where users can trade digital assets, FTX offered “bridging” services. A crypto bridge connects two disparate blockchains.

Crypto.com tweeted that its chief executive Kris Marszalek would go live on YouTube to answer questions around some transactions on the platform that had sparked speculation and fund withdrawals.

""A lot has happened in the last week and there are a lot of questions which we want to address,"" the exchange said on Monday.

The questions around a transfer of a big chunk of ether tokens last month from Crypto.com to another platform were raised by an user who dug through transactions after the company posted its cold wallet addresses online.

While Marszalek tweeted to say the ether, worth about $US400 million ($A600 million), had been accidentally transferred and was recovered, his comments failed to allay concerns in a market already on edge after the spectacular public collapse of FTX last week.

The Wall Street Journal reported that withdrawals at Crypto.com rose at the weekend after Marszalek's tweet. Twitter users pointed to other transfers between some other smaller platforms and exchanges as possible evidence that they were leaning on each other to shore up reserves.

Bitcoin slid further to below $US16,000, taking losses for the month to 22.5 per cent, while FTX's token was at $US1.60 and down 94 per cent in November. Crypto.com's token cronos has halved in the past week to $US0.06.

Crypto.com is among the top 10 exchanges by turnover globally, but smaller than FTX and market leader Binance. It made headlines in 2021 after it signed a $US700 million deal to rename the Staples Center in Los Angeles as the Crypto.com Arena, and got actor Matt Damon to promote the platform.

Meanwhile, the effects of the collapse of Bahamas-based FTX, which filed for bankruptcy on Friday after a rush of customer withdrawals and a failed rescue deal with rival exchange Binance, continued to affect markets.

The Bahamas securities regulator and financial investigators were investigating potential misconduct over the collapse of FTX, the Royal Bahamas Police Force said on Sunday.

Bloomberg news reported exchange AAX had halted withdrawals.

Visa, the world's largest payments processor, said on Sunday it was severing its global credit card agreements with FTX.

Binance chief executive Changpeng Zhao, meanwhile, tweeted that the exchange had never short-sold FTT tokens.

Zhao abandoned a deal with FTX chief Sam Bankman-Fried last week to buy FTX's non-US assets, precipitating the bankruptcy.

He has since warned of a ""cascading"" crypto crisis and on Monday called for clearer crypto industry regulation."

CryptoSlate Top Stories

Concerns over Crypto.com’s 320,000 ETH transfer to Gate.io, and sluggish withdrawal process raised speculations that Crypto.com may be on the verge of a collapse.

However, the exchange CEO Kris Marszalek in a recent AMA said that the insolvency rumors were false, adding that business activities were going normally. According to Marszalek, Crypto.com’s soon-to-be-published audited proof-of-reserve will verify that the platform is solvent.

On-chain data revealed that Crypto.com transferred 320,000 ETH to Gate.io, shortly before Gate.io published its proof-of-reserves on Oct. 28.

In the wake of the FTX collapse, the crypto community has raised concerns that the crypto exchanges may have intentionally inflated their reserve holdings.

In his defense, Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek said that the funds were mistakenly sent to Gate.io, but was returned immediately.

Huobi Global published its proof-of-reserve on Oct. 13, which showed it held 14,858 ETH in the Huobi 34 wallet. However, shortly after the snapshot was published, WuBlockchain pointed out that 10,000 ETH left the wallet, raising concerns over a “fake reserve snapshot.”

According to Huobi, the hot wallet usually sees inflows and outflows frequently. As such, the 10,000 ETH outflow was not intended to inflate the reserve.

Crypto exchanges Kraken, Coinbase, and Gate.io has moved to publish a comprehensive proof-of-reserve to assure customers of their liquidity.

The proof-of-reserve of the three exchanges disclosed their total liabilities, alongside assets holdings.

Bitcoin maximalist and El Salvador President Nayib Bukele labeled the FTX empire a Ponzi scheme, that was bound to fail. He called out Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) for secretly transferring customers’ funds to Alameda Research.

However, he proclaimed that Bitcoin was designed to prevent Ponzi schemes as transactions are open-source for public verification.

Former Huobi CEO Leon Li has offered to issue a $14 million loan to help a subsidiary of New Huo Technology (Hbit Limited) cover all funds locked up in the bankrupt FTX.

Hbit reportedly has about $$13.2 million of customers’ assets and $4.9 million of its asset locked up in FTX. The $14 million loan from Leon Li will help the exchange compensate all affected users in full.

In the wake of the widespread market contagion caused by the FTX collapse, Binance CEO Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao said that his exchange would launch an industry recovery fund to help strong projects facing financial distress.

Industry experts including Tron (TRX)founder Justin Sun and investor Simon Dixon said they would contribute to the initiative to help good builders and developers recover from the crisis.

FTX executives including Sam Bakman-Fried, Ryan Salame, and Nishad Singh reportedly spent over $68 million to support U.S politicians in their election bids.

Following the FTX collapse, U.S. Congressman Brad Sherman said that the donations were a sinister plan to influence crypto regulation to FTX’s favor.

Sherman called on the SEC to take decisive actions and proffer a clear regulatory framework to prevent shady deals in the crypto industry.

John E. Deaton that the SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s relationship with FTX may have influenced the commission from issuing clear guidelines to regulate the crypto industry.

Deaton went on to argue that former SEC Director William Hinman’s foul play with Ethereum has roped in Ripple with the SEC. Hoskinson moved to dismiss Deaton’s argument stating that a “free pass” on Ethereum’s status has no effect on Ripple’s lawsuit.

In response, Ripple CTO Joel Schwartz said that the SEC’s move to classify Ethereum as a commodity and XRP as a security was unfair.

FTX CEO and Chief Restructuring Officer John Ray said that in efforts to restructure the bankrupt crypto exchange, it will remove all trading and withdrawal functions from the platform, and move all available crypto assets to a new cold wallet.

Founder of the bankrupt FTX empire Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) reportedly leveraged a secret code in its accounting software to transfer some $10 billion to Alameda Research notifying anyone of the transaction.

When questioned about the missing funds, SBF did not provide any clear explanation.

Binance CEO Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao during an AMA on Twitter Spaces said his exchange was not adversely affected by the FTX collapse. He added that Binance adding was working to support some strong projects to recover their losses.

On the way forward, CZ said Binance will work with Vitalik Buterin on his proposed Proof-of-Reserves protocol and establish a global association of key players to cater to the development of the crypto industry.

Market data analyzed by CryptoSlate indicates a shift of asset holdings from centralized exchanges to decentralized exchanges.

According to Bitcoinity data, bitcoin trading volumes across 10 leading centralized exchanges decreased from 182,000 BTC per day on Nov. 9 to 38,000 BTC on Nov. 13.

In contrast, decentralized exchanges saw a spike in trading volume from roughly $2.9 billion on Nov. 7 to $12 billion on Nov. 10.

On-chain data shows that Huobi, Gate.io, and Crypto.com saw most of their Bitcoin balances flow into FTX, in the months preceding the FTX collapse.

At the beginning of October, Bitcoin flows from Huobi to FTX tripled, while Gate.io saw a surge from late October into November before the contagion started.

To curtail insolvency risk playing out on centralized exchanges may retail investors have moved their Bitcoin for self-custody on cold wallets.

According to CryptoSlate analysis, the total BTC balance across exchanges has declined by 72,900 BTC in the last seven days. In addition, over 1 million ETH has also gone into cold wallets, following the FTX fallout.

Research Highlight

Bitcoin’s recent fall to $15,682 led to aggressive accumulation for investors of all classes.

On-chain data analyzed by CryptoSlate reveals that Shrimps (investors with less than 1 BTC) took advantage of the price crash to increase their positions, to a new high of 1 million BTC, while Crabs (investors holding between 1 BTC to 10 BTC) saw their total holdings surge up to 2.8 million.

Sharks (holders of between 10 BTC to 1000 BTC) maximized the FTX-led market crash to accumulate Bitcoin aggressively, making their total holdings reach a new all-time high of 6.9 million.

BTC Whale who hold more than 1000 BTC also took advantage of the cheap BTC price to increase their holdings, though not as much as the Shrimps, Crabs, and Sharks.

Stocks fell on Wall Street Monday, giving back some of their huge gains made last week on hopes the worst of the nation’s inflation may finally have passed.

The S&P 500 fell 0.9%, or 35.68 points, to 3,957.25 after drifting between gains and losses several times through the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.6%, or 211.16, to 33,536.70, and the Nasdaq composite fell 1.1%, or 127.11, to 11,196.22.

The losses follow Wall Street’s best week since June, when the S&P 500 surged 5.9% after encouraging data on inflation sparked speculation the Federal Reserve may ease up on its fusillade of interest-rate hikes meant to get prices under control. Such rate hikes have raised worries about a possible recession, while also dragging down prices for stocks, bonds and cryptocurrencies.

Some analysts have called Wall Street’s recent rally overdone, including a 5.5% surge for the S&P 500 on Thursday alone, saying one report does not mean the coast is clear, even if it was encouraging. Some officials at the Federal Reserve have also urged caution, with Fed Governor Christopher Waller saying the better-than-expected reading on inflation for October “was just one data point” and that “everybody should just take a deep breath.”

Such warnings weighed on stocks Monday, as did a rise in Treasury yields. But the market also got a brief boost after Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard gave comments that investors took as a hint that the steepest of the Fed’s rate hikes may have passed.

“The inflation data was reassuring, preliminarily,” she said. “It will probably be appropriate, soon, to move to a slower pace of rate increases.”

In each of its last four meetings, the Fed has hiked its key overnight rate by a big 0.75 percentage points, which is triple the usual amount. Bets have increased since last week’s inflation report that the Fed’s next move will be an increase of only 0.50 percentage points. While that’s still a big increase relative to history, investors are starving for any indication the Fed may ease up on its rate hikes.

Even before last week's report on inflation, Fed Chair Jerome Powell already said such a dial down in the size of rate hikes may be imminent. But he also said the Fed nevertheless could still ultimately take rates higher than earlier expected, and that it may hold rates at that high level a while to make sure inflation stays under control.

Fed officials have been reiterating how the Fed's campaign against high inflation still looks to be a long one.

“Quit paying attention to the pace and start paying attention to where the endpoint is going to be,"" Waller said. ""Until we get inflation down, that endpoint is still a ways out there.”

Several economic reports due this week could offer more clues about where inflation is heading.

Law firm Slater and Gordon this week reached settlements with Commonwealth Bank (CBA), ANZ and Westpac - which are subject to court approval - to compensate customers for consumer credit insurance they were sold while taking out credit cards and personal loans.

Many customers who were sold the insurance were unlikely to or may have been ineligible to make a claim due to unemployment or pre-existing health conditions or disabilities when they took out the policy.

Slater and Gordon said some customers never consented to buying the policies and others were never told they would be charged for it.

The settlements, which were without any admission of wrongdoing, mean affected CBA customers will receive a share in $50 million from the bank and its insurer Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Limited.

ANZ and insurers OnePath Life, OnePath General Insurance, Zurich and QBE agreed to pay out $47 million, while Westpac and insurers Westpac Life Insurance and Westpac General Insurance reached a $29 million settlement.

Lead plaintiff in the CBA proceedings, Queensland woman Kristy Fordham, says she was sold the loan protection without being asked.

At the time, the single mother-of-four was not working and had been diagnosed with serious health conditions including chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia.

This made her ineligible to claim the main benefits of the policy, but she says she had no idea she was not covered by the policy.

She says she was told by a bank employee there was no guarantee her loan would be approved unless she took out a $25-a-month insurance policy.

“We were all so vulnerable or else we wouldn’t have needed loans from them in the first place, yet they took advantage of that, in my opinion,” Fordham said.

“It was behaviour that they made a lot of money from, so it’s about time those of us affected get compensated.”

Slater and Gordon senior associate Alex Blennerhassett said the win was one way people could take on big corporations.

“Taking on the big banks was never going to be easy but we are pleased that we have been able to resolve these group proceedings and that eligible customers will benefit,” Blennerhassett said.

Banks respond

ANZ said it had reached an agreement to settle the class action brought against it in 2020.

“The class action is against a number of parties, including ANZ, and relates to the sale of three consumer credit insurance products,” ANZ said.

“ANZ will contribute $42 million to the settlement, which is covered by provision held at September 30, 2022. The settlement is without admission of liability and remains subject to court approval.”

Westpac said the class action related to the sale of policies prior to 2019.

“The settlement amount is $29 million and remains subject to approval by the Federal Court of Australia,” it said.

“Westpac has not sold consumer credit insurance products since 2019.”

A CBA spokesperson said if the court approves the $50 million settlement, members will be able to register for the settlement distribution scheme.

“The settlement distribution scheme will determine if individual group members are entitled to recover a share of the settlement sum, after accounting for any deductions which may be approved by the court, such as legal fees charged by the applicant’s lawyers,” the said.

CBA said the class action relates to consumer credit insurance for credit cards and personal loans sold between January 1, 2010 and March 7, 2018.

The Commonwealth Bank (CBA), ANZ and Westpac will be ordered to dole out the eye-watering compensation to customers lumped with consumer credit insurance (CCI) that they neither wanted or could benefit from.

The insurance was frequently bundled in with personal loans or taking out new credit cards but those buying it were often unaware that they could not benefit from it because of unemployment or medical conditions.

Some customers were not even told the insurance was optional or that would be charged for it.

Slater and Gordon will contact those eligible for a share of the compensation.

Lead plaintiff in the CBA proceedings Kristy Fordham was sold Loan Protection without requesting it.

The single mother-of-four was told her personal loan would not be approved if she did not pay the $25-a-month insurance policy.

This was despite her being ineligible to make a claim against the insurance because she didn't have a job and suffered multiple medical conditions, including fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia.

'It was behaviour that they made a lot of money from, so it's about time those of us affected get compensated.'

Customers of Commonwealth Bank (CBA), ANZ and Westpac will receive their share of more than $126 million after a successful class action lawsuit over the sale of junk insurance.

Slater and Gordon said the settlement was reached over consumer credit insurance (CCI) that was sold to customers when taking out credit cards or personal loans.

The three settlements, which are still all subject to court approval, are expected to result in up to 1 million CBA, ANZ and Westpac customers being eligible to receive compensation for CCI they were sold.

Many customers may have been ineligible or were unlikely to be able to make a claim because they were already unemployed or had pre-existing health conditions or disabilities when they took out the insurance, Slater and Gordon said.

Some may have never provided their consent to purchase the policies, were not informed that the insurance was optional and/or were not informed that they would be charged for it.

During the banking royal commission, Slater and Gordon also initiated a class action against NAB and MLC over its CCI policies on behalf of 50,000 customers. A $49.5 million settlement was reached in November 2019.

Slater and Gordon Class Actions senior associate Alex Blennerhassett said the settlements were without admission of any wrongdoing.

“Class actions are one way people can take on big corporations, including Australia’s Big Four banks.”

Bank customers eligible for a share in the settlements will be contacted by Slater and Gordon. They do not need to contact the firm.

Up to one million ANZ, Westpac and Commonwealth Bank customers will share in settlements worth $126 million after being sold consumer credit insurance of little use.

Without admitting any wrongdoing over the sale of insurance when customers took out credit cards or personal loans, CBA has agreed to pay $50 million, ANZ $42 million and Westpac $29 million.

A $5 million payment is being made by QBE Insurance regarding policies sold in relation to ANZ products.

The settlements remain subject to court approval and follow similar action against National Australia Bank in 2019 which netted 50,000 customers $49.5 million.

Lawyers Slater and Gordon said many of the banks’ customers were unlikely to be able to make a claim because they were already unemployed or had pre-existing health conditions or disabilities.

Some never provided their consent to purchase the policies, were not informed that the insurance was optional, or were not told they would be charged for it.

Lead ANZ plaintiff Tracey Reilly, from Queensland, was sold ANZ Credit Card Protection policies without consenting, but when she came to make a claim was told she was ineligible because she had pre-existing symptoms that were later diagnosed as cancer.

“I’m glad this has been completed with a great result,” she said.

“Now at least people can have a portion of what they paid returned to them, as some people are going through a rough financial time, so every dollar will help.”

Lead Westpac plaintiff Roger Kemp, from Western Australia, could not recall taking out his Flexi Loan Repayment Protection insurance but was also ineligible when the opportunity came to make a claim.

(Reuters) -Three of Australia's 'big four' banks settled separate class action lawsuits for A$126 million ($84.51 million) with Slater & Gordon, who took the banks to court two years ago over sale of credit insurance products, the companies said on Monday.

Law firm Slater & Gordon in 2020 filed class action lawsuits against Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corp, and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group on behalf of around one million customers.

The lawsuit alleged the entities and associated parties made customers believe their policy payments were ""compulsory or provided value to them"", as well as misled or were deceptive in conduct over selling or issuing policies with no value, the law firm said.

CBA, the country's biggest lender, said the settlement involves other defendants including Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society (CMLA) and AIA Australia Ltd, who would together pay A$50 million to their customers if court approves the sum.

ANZ, along with QBE Insurance, and OnePath Life and OnePath General Insurance, indirect units of Swiss firm Zurich Insurance Group, will pay a total of A$47 million to their customers under the settlement, with ANZ contributing A$42 million, Slater & Gordon said.

Westpac would pay A$29 million, subject to court's approval.

Up to one million ANZ, Westpac and Commonwealth Bank customers will share in settlements worth $126 million after being sold consumer credit insurance of little use.

The CBA has agreed to pay $50 million, ANZ $42 million and Westpac $29 million, without admitting any wrongdoing, over the sale of insurance when customers took out credit cards or personal loans.

A $5 million payment is being made by QBE Insurance regarding policies sold in relation to ANZ products.

The settlements remain subject to court approval and follow similar action against National Australia Bank in 2019 which netted 50,000 customers $49.5 million.

Lawyers Slater and Gordon said many of the banks' customers were unlikely to be able to make a claim because they were already unemployed or had pre-existing health conditions or disabilities.

Some never provided their consent to purchase the policies, were not informed that the insurance was optional, or were not told they would be charged for it.

Lead CBA plaintiff Kristy Fordham, from Queensland, was sold loan protection without requesting it despite not working at the time and suffering from serious health conditions, making her ineligible to claim.

""I believe the bank knew full well that we couldn't benefit from their products, but they deliberately sold them to us anyway,"" she said.

""We were all so vulnerable or else we wouldn't have needed loans from them in the first place, yet they took advantage of that, in my opinion.""

Lead ANZ plaintiff Tracey Reilly, from Queensland, was sold ANZ Credit Card Protection policies without consenting but when she came to make a claim was told she was ineligible because she had pre-existing symptoms that were later diagnosed as cancer.

""I'm glad this has been completed with a great result,"" she said.

""Now at least people can have a portion of what they paid returned to them, as some people are going through a rough financial time, so every dollar will help.""

Law firm Slater & Gordon in 2020 filed class action lawsuits against Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corp, and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group on behalf of around one million customers.

The lawsuit alleged the entities and associated parties made customers believe their policy payments were ""compulsory or provided value to them"", as well as misled or were deceptive in conduct over selling or issuing policies with no value, the law firm said.

CBA, the country's biggest lender, said the settlement involves other defendants including Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society (CMLA) and AIA Australia Ltd, who would together pay A$50 million to their customers if court approves the sum.

ANZ, along with QBE Insurance, and OnePath Life and OnePath General Insurance, indirect units of Swiss firm Zurich Insurance Group, will pay a total of A$47 million to their customers under the settlement, with ANZ contributing A$42 million, Slater & Gordon said.

Westpac would pay A$29 million, subject to court's approval.

2ca0911f-a42e-49d0-a607-6371f5e7c175,"“So everybody should just take a deep breath and calm down,” Waller said. “We’ve got a ways to go.”

The market will no doubt file all this under “he would say that” and go about its business. Indeed, the ASX 200 rose 0.4 per cent in early trade, pushing it well above 7000 points. This followed Friday’s strong lead from Wall Street, where a second day of gains took the S & P 500’s two-day rally to 6.5 per cent.

Unspoken warning

But while Fed officials are loath to comment too much on market movements, investors would be wise to take note of Waller’s pointed reference to the market rally that occurred in July, which was sparked by comments from Fed chairman Jerome Powell that interest rates were approaching neutral.

That rally, Waller said, “led to a loosening of financial conditions that we were trying not to do” and ultimately forced Powell to deliver his ultra-hawkish speech in Jackson Hole in August, and the Fed to continue to ram through four straight 0.75 percentage point rate increases, including one earlier this month.

The unspoken warning to investors was clear: if you get too excited now, then you’ll only make our jobs harder.

Waller, who was nominated by former US president Donald Trump, is also a member of the Fed’s Open Market Committee that sets the Fed’s official rate. That he was prepared to acknowledge that the Fed was too far behind the curve when it started to raise rates in March, he also seemed pleased with the way its tightening cycle has gone.

“What’s impressed me to no end is that it hasn’t broken anything. For all the talk of crashing the economy and breaking the financial markets, it hasn’t done that,” he said.

Most economists and strategists have decided the peak of US inflation is behind us.

“We’ve got [the Fed funds rate] to kind of a good level, and we got it there fast, and we didn’t break anything. And if we can start seeing some inflation coming down, then that’ll help guide us on how much faster and how high we have to go on rates.”

Of course, the Fed’s efforts haven’t broken inflation in any major way either; Waller said Thursday’s night 7.7 per cent reading for the US CPI was “enormous” and reiterated Powell’s point that the pace of rate increases was now far less important than the ultimate peak of this tightening cycle, and how long rates need to stay elevated.

That’s a fascinating question. Clearly, most economists and strategists have decided the peak of US inflation is behind us, including Bank of America’s uber bear Michael Hartnett. But he is less confident of the bull market narrative for 2023, that the Fed can be done with rate rises by the middle of next year, and start cutting before next Christmas.

Inflation is coming down, Hartnett says, but it will remain above the range we’ve seen for the past two decades, giving the Fed little room to move.

Waller wouldn’t give that sort of forward guidance, but his message was clear: everything still depends on the path of US inflation, and it’s still far too high."
dc032034-24a0-4f16-aaff-440ad38c5dcd,"Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said “we’ve still got a ways to go” before the US central bank stops raising interest rates, despite good news last week on consumer prices.

At the same time, policymakers can start considering whether to downshift their speed after four straight hikes of 75 basis points, and the Fed is considering a 50 basis-point hike at the next meeting in December or the one after that, Waller said.

“These rates are going to stay -- keep going up -- and they’re going to stay high for a while until we see this inflation get down closer to our target,” Waller said Monday at a UBS Group AG conference in Sydney. “We’ve still got a ways to go. This isn’t ending in the next meeting or two.”

The comments echoed remarks this month from Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other colleagues who said interest-rate increases were far from over but the speed could possibly slow soon.

Waller has been one of the US central bank’s more hawkish policymakers advocating for tighter policy to cool price pressures.

Inflation needs to keep going down

Data last week showed US consumer prices cooling by more than expected in October, with the consumer price index rising 7.7% from a year earlier versus 8.2% the month before.

That hardened bets by investors that the Fed would raise rates by 50 basis points in December, according to pricing in futures markets, with the benchmark rate peaking around 4.9% in mid-2023.

“It’s good finally that we saw some evidence of inflation starting to come down,” Waller said. “We’re going to need to see a continued run of this kind of behavior on inflation slowly starting to come down before we really start thinking about taking our foot off the brakes here.”

The Fed raised interest rates by 75 basis points on Nov. 2 for the fourth straight meeting to a 3.75% to 4% target range and said ongoing increases will be needed as it fights the highest inflation in 40 years.

Powell told reporters after the decision that recent disappointing data suggests rates will ultimately need to go higher than previously expected, while indicating the central bank could moderate the size of its increases as soon as December.

Officials in September forecast rates would reach 4.4% by the end of this year and 4.6% in 2023 -- implying a half-point hike in December and a final quarter-point move next year. They will update their quarterly projections next month.

Dr Waller was thought to be a dove when appointed to the Fed’s board of governors by former president Donald Trump in 2019 but his voting record has been one of the more hawkish on the committee that sets interest rates for the world’s largest economy.

The Federal Reserve has increased rates at one of the fastest paces in history from near zero in April to between 3.75 per cent and 4 per cent in November.

He was asked to explain why markets interpreted the November statement that hinted at a slower pace of rate increases as dovish, only for Fed chair Jerome Powell to say that rates would need to go higher than expected to force a retreat from risk assets.

Focus on the end point

Dr Waller said the Fed knew that it would face a challenge explaining that even as it signalled it would slow the pace of interest rate increases from 75 basis point to 50 basis point increments, it was not softening its stance.

“I can’t speak for the chair but as I watched the press conference, that was the signal – to quit paying attention to the pace and start paying attention to where the end point is going to be.”

Dr Waller said that real-interest rates were still relatively low, citing policy models, such as the Taylor Rule that would suggest the Fed Fund rate should be about 6 per cent to 7 per cent.

“If your real rates are not even in restricted territory yet, it’s hard to say that you’re going too far too fast.”

He added that he was also “impressed” that the rapid pace of rate increases had not broken financial markets.

“I’ve just been amazed to watch rates go up almost 400 basis points in about seven months, eight months and the markets haven’t collapsed. We don’t have a financial crisis or anything along those lines.”

“We’ve got to have a good level, and we got it there fast, and we didn’t break anything. If we can start seeing some inflation coming down that will help guide us on how much faster and how much higher we have to go on rates.”

But by the same token, Dr Waller says labour markets had stood up to the sharp rate increases.

“We’re certainly not breaking anything in the labor markets in terms of unemployment.”

Dr Waller said markets were predicting inflation to fall in 2023 which would result in significant real interest rate tightening because of the combination of low inflation expectations and high policy rate.

He added that there was “nothing to worry about” in the housing market as rate increases had only caused a retracement of the surging property valuations after the pandemic, and most buyers were still in positive “healthy gain territory.”

351ca806-7e93-4697-b4eb-b3f58bec4bfd,"Hong Kong CNN Business —

Chinese authorities are making their biggest effort yet to end a crisis in the country’s vast real estate sector that has weighed heavily on the economy over the past year.

Shares of China’s biggest property developer Country Garden soared as much as 52% in Hong Kong after Beijing on Friday unveiled a 16-point plan that significantly eases a crackdown on lending to the sector.

Key measures include allowing banks to extend maturing loans to developers, supporting property sales by reducing the size of down payments and cutting mortgage rates, boosting other funding channels such as bond issues, and ensuring the delivery of pre-sold homes to buyers.

“In essence, policymakers told banks to try their best in supporting the property sector,” according to Larry Hu, chief China economist for Macquarie Group.

Tao Wang, chief China economist at UBS, described the package of measures as a “turning point” for China’s property sector. Along with other policies announced earlier this year, it could inject more than 1 trillion yuan ($142 billion) into real estate, she estimated.

Chinese developers listed in Hong Kong jumped 11% on average on Monday, leading the broader market higher. Longfor Properties — another top developer — jumped 17% while shares of Dexin China, a Hangzhou-based developer, skyrocketed by 151%.

The rescue package is viewed by many analysts as the strongest signal yet from Chinese authorities that a two-year crackdown on the sector is now over. In August 2020, the government began trying to rein in excessive borrowing by developers to curb runaway house prices.

The problems escalated last year when Evergrande — the nation’s second largest developer — defaulted on its debt. As the property sector crashed, several major companies sought protection from their creditors. The cash crunch meant that work on many pre-sold housing projects across the country was delayed or suspended.

The crisis entered a new phase this summer when angry home buyers refused to pay mortgages on unfinished homes, roiling financial markets and sparking fears of contagion. Since then, authorities have tried to defuse the crisis by urging banks to increase loan support for developers so that they can complete projects. Regulators have also cut interest rates in a bid to restore buyer confidence.

But the property slump persisted, as buyers backed away from the market because of the weak economy and strict Covid curbs. In October, sales by the 100 biggest real estate developers contracted 26.5% from a year ago, according to a private survey by China Index Academy, a top real estate research firm. So far this year, their sales have fallen by 43%.

Along with a strict zero-Covid policy that has squeezed manufacturing and consumer spending, the property woes have dragged on China’s economy. In the third quarter, China’s GDP grew by 3.9% from a year earlier, putting overall growth for the first nine months at just 3%, far below the official target of 5.5% set in March.

While welcoming Friday’s measures, analysts remained cautious about the impact it would have on buyer confidence.

“The property market has yet to show signs of recovery,” said Nomura analysts in a research report on Monday, adding that the latest measures may have “little direct impact” on stimulating home purchases.

“Beijing’s﻿ zero-Covid strategy, despite some latest fine tuning, will continue to weigh on the property sector,” they added."
72698b9a-dba5-4751-93c0-7a9d48246149,"













HONG KONG, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Chinese property stocks and bonds soared on Monday as the market cheered Beijing's ""most comprehensive"" support measures aimed at boosting liquidity in the sector in its latest attempt to stabilise a key pillar for the world's second-largest economy.

The package, which sources say lays out multiple financing measures for the cash-strapped industry, was hailed by analysts as a ""turning point"" with one even describing it as the equivalent of ""soaking rain after a long drought"".

China's property sector, which accounts for a quarter of the economy, has struggled with defaults and stalled projects, hitting market confidence and weighing on growth.

Previous efforts by policymakers to help ease the cash crunch have done little to bolster the property market.

The plan comes nearly a month after Chinese President Xi Jinping secured his third term at the helm of the ruling Communist Party at a time when the economy faces a series of headwinds including China's zero-COVID strategy, a property slump and global recession risks.

""We see property being much less of a drag to GDP (gross domestic product) growth in 2023,"" said Tao Wang, chief China economist at UBS Investment Bank Research.

The Hang Seng Mainland Properties Index (.HSMPI) jumped more than 13.5% to close at a two-month high, with the share prices of many Chinese property developers posting double-digit gains.

Country Garden (2007.HK) rallied 45.5% to hit an over three-month high. Logan Group (3380.HK), KWG Group (1813.HK), Agile Group (3383.HK) and R&F Properties (2777.HK) all rose more than 30%.

A dollar bond of defaulted Yango Group due 2023 rose 1.787 cents on the dollar to 2.712 in early trade, according to data from Duration Finance. Powerlong Real Estate's April 2025 bond was traded at 9.275 cents, 3.055 cents higher than Friday. Their bonds also surged onshore.

Two sources told Reuters on Sunday a notice to financial institutions from the People's Bank of China (PBOC) and the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) outlined 16 steps to support the property sector, including loan repayment extensions.

PBOC and CBIRC have not responded to Reuters' requests for comment.

Meanwhile, the CBIRC on Friday issued a notice allowing commercial banks to issue letters of guarantee to real estate firms for escrow pre-sale housing funds.

AILING PROPERTY MARKET

Citi said the package signals a major shift in regulators' policy stance on developers, from ""imposing restrictions"" to ""providing support"", and ""rescuing projects, but not developers"" to ""rescuing both developers and projects"".

The notice ""introduced by far the most comprehensive set of support measures for the ailing property market,"" it said.

Jefferies estimated the package, together with other recent policies, would inject around 1.3 trillion yuan ($183.83 billion) credit into the property sector, largely covering private developers' public bonds and trust products due to mature by end-2023.

Last week, the National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors said it would widen a programme to support about 250 billion yuan worth of debt sales by private firms, including property developers.

Some investors remained cautious about the impact of the latest policy, however, as regulators have already made many attempts to revive the property sector and the macro environment remains weak amid the country's COVID restrictions.

China's property sector has slowed sharply this year as the government sought to restrict excessive borrowing by developers.

The clampdown has triggered falls in property sales and prices, bond defaults and the suspension of housing construction, angering homeowners which have threatened to stop mortgage payments.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Chinese property stocks and bonds soared on Monday as the market cheered Beijing's ""most comprehensive"" support measures aimed at boosting liquidity in the sector in its latest attempt to stabilise a key pillar for the world's second-largest economy.

The package, which sources say lays out multiple financing measures for the cash-strapped industry, was hailed by analysts as a ""turning point"" with one even describing it as the equivalent of ""soaking rain after a long drought"".

China's property sector, which accounts for a quarter of the economy, has struggled with defaults and stalled projects, hitting market confidence and weighing on growth.

Previous efforts by policymakers to help ease the cash crunch have done little to bolster the property market.

The plan comes nearly a month after Chinese President Xi Jinping secured his third term at the helm of the ruling Communist Party at a time when the economy faces a series of headwinds including China's zero-COVID strategy, a property slump and global recession risks.

""We see property being much less of a drag to GDP (gross domestic product) growth in 2023,"" said Tao Wang, chief China economist at UBS Investment Bank Research.

The Hang Seng Mainland Properties Index jumped more than 13.5% to close at a two-month high, with the share prices of many Chinese property developers posting double-digit gains.

Country Garden rallied 45.5% to hit an over three-month high. Logan Group, KWG Group, Agile Group and R&F Properties all rose more than 30%.

A dollar bond of defaulted Yango Group due 2023 rose 1.787 cents on the dollar to 2.712 in early trade, according to data from Duration Finance. Powerlong Real Estate's April 2025 bond was traded at 9.275 cents, 3.055 cents higher than Friday. Their bonds also surged onshore.

Two sources told Reuters on Sunday a notice to financial institutions from the People's Bank of China (PBOC) and the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) outlined 16 steps to support the property sector, including loan repayment extensions.

PBOC and CBIRC have not responded to Reuters' requests for comment.

Meanwhile, the CBIRC on Friday issued a notice allowing commercial banks to issue letters of guarantee to real estate firms for escrow pre-sale housing funds.

AILING PROPERTY MARKET

Citi said the package signals a major shift in regulators' policy stance on developers, from ""imposing restrictions"" to ""providing support"", and ""rescuing projects, but not developers"" to ""rescuing both developers and projects"".

The notice ""introduced by far the most comprehensive set of support measures for the ailing property market,"" it said.

Jefferies estimated the package, together with other recent policies, would inject around 1.3 trillion yuan ($183.83 billion) credit into the property sector, largely covering private developers' public bonds and trust products due to mature by end-2023.

Last week, the National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors said it would widen a programme to support about 250 billion yuan worth of debt sales by private firms, including property developers.

Some investors remained cautious about the impact of the latest policy, however, as regulators have already made many attempts to revive the property sector and the macro environment remains weak amid the country's COVID restrictions.

China's property sector has slowed sharply this year as the government sought to restrict excessive borrowing by developers.

The clampdown has triggered falls in property sales and prices, bond defaults and the suspension of housing construction, angering homeowners which have threatened to stop mortgage payments.

Private data released earlier in November showed home prices in 100 cities dropped for a fourth month in October, while property sales by floor area fell about 20% year-on-year.

""At the end of the day, the rebound of home sales is still needed for an ultimate industry comeback,"" said James Wong, portfolio manager at GaoTeng Global Asset Management Ltd.

Li Gen, CEO of Beijing BG Capital Management Ltd, which specialises in credit investment, said developers that have not defaulted would benefit the most, but the help would be ""less meaningful"" for offshore property bonds as it remains unclear how offshore financing could be enhanced.

Citi said the package should also help bank shares as it eases investors' concern on developers' credit risk.

Banks with higher exposure to developers including Ping An Bank, Industrial Bank and China Merchants Bank, would particularly benefit, Citi added.

United States

US consumer inflation expectations in the short and long run increased in early November, while sentiment retreated to a four-month low amid rising borrowing costs.

Consumers expect prices will climb at an annual rate of 3 per cent over the next five to 10 years, up from 2.9 per cent in October and the highest in five months, the University of Michigan’s preliminary November survey showed Friday. They see costs rising 5.1 per cent over the next year, compared to last month’s 5 per cent.

The sentiment index dropped to 54.7, worse than all forecasts in a Bloomberg survey, from 59.9 in October.

“Continued uncertainty over inflation expectations suggests that such entrenchment in the future is still possible,” Joanne Hsu, director of the survey, said in a statement.

Nov 14 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets from Jamie McGeever.

Asian markets kick off the trading week on Monday, with investors probably still reeling from what was one of the most dramatic weeks in recent market history.

The week ahead surely won't be anywhere near as volatile.

Just to recap, weaker-than-expected U.S. inflation figures for October on Thursday sparked a dramatic repricing of the Fed's policy path next year, slamming the dollar and fueling a huge rally in stocks, risk assets, and bonds.

The two-year Treasury yield plunged 30 basis points on Friday, its biggest fall since 2008; the Nasdaq was up 8% on the week; and the dollar was down 4%, amazingly, its fourth biggest weekly decline since the era of free-floating exchange rates began over 50 years ago.

Oh, and if that wasn't enough, the crypto universe was plunged into complete chaos after the dramatic multi-billion dollar collapse of crypto exchange FTX and fall from grace of its 30-year old founder Sam Bankman-Fried.

If investors can zoom out a little and put the crypto circus to one side, they may take the view that last week did indeed mark a fundamental shift: inflation has peaked, the Fed and other central banks will not tighten as much, and the dollar has turned.

A more bearish analysis might also note that next year is likely to be marked by recession across much of the world as the lagged impact of recent tightening finally hits. Cooling inflation and less aggressive tightening will not necessarily mean risky assets do well.

As market participants regroup, reassess, and re-position, the week ahead is packed with the regular flow of economic data and policymaker speeches.

There is also the face-to-face meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Bali on Monday. It's safe to say relations between the two superpowers are frosty, so any sign of thawing could add to the positive market sentiment spilling over from last week.

A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a bigger contraction of 0.5 per cent in gross domestic product in the third quarter.

The Bank of England said last week that Britain's economy was set to go into a two-year recession if interest rates rose as much as investors had been pricing.

Even without further rate hikes, the economy would shrink in five of the six quarters until the end of 2023, it said.

In September alone, when the funeral of Queen Elizabeth was marked with a one-off public holiday that shut many businesses, Britain's economy shrank by 0.6 per cent, a bigger fall than a median forecast for a 0.4 per cent contraction in the Reuters poll.

But gross domestic product data for August was revised to show a marginal 0.1 per cent contraction compared with an original reading of a 0.3 per cent shrinkage, and GDP in July was now seen as having grown by 0.3 per cent, up from a previous estimate of 0.1 per cent.

The weak economic outlook provides a tough backdrop for next week's budget statement by finance minister Jeremy Hunt.

Responding to Friday's data, he repeated his warnings of tough decisions on tax and spending in order to repair Britain's public finances and the government's credibility on economic policy after Liz Truss's brief spell as prime minister.

""I am under no illusion that there is a tough road ahead - one which will require extremely difficult decisions to restore confidence and economic stability,"" Hunt said in a statement.

""But to achieve long-term, sustainable growth, we need to grip inflation, balance the books and get debt falling. There is no other way."""

Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said: “Interest rate rises and the prospect of the Bank of England raising them even further could exacerbate the stalemate in the UK housing market, causing more pronounced cutbacks in spending. In addition, a turn to a more austere fiscal policy expected from next week’s Autumn Statement could contribute to prolonging any downturn.

Prime minister Rishi Sunak is facing a huge challenge as he tries to stabilise the UK economy. (PA)

The UK has taken an unwelcome step towards what the Bank of England has warned could be its longest recession in 100 years as the country continues to battle soaring inflation.

On Friday, it was announced the economy had shrunk by 0.2% between July and September with declines in manufacturing, retail and the bank holiday for the Queen's funeral all taking its toll.

In a bid to get surging prices back under control and reduce the cost-of-living crisis, the central bank has been raising interest rates, which increases the cost of borrowing and encourages people to save instead of spend.

The Bank's chief economist Huw Pill says there is ""still more to do"" to tackle persistent inflation, after the base rate of interest was raised to 3% last week - the single biggest rise since 1989.

There is a chance it could raise rates again in December, despite this potentially worsening a prolonged recession expected to grip the UK.

So what do these dire economic warnings actually mean? Here, Yahoo News UK explains how people's everyday lives will be affected.

What is a recession?

A recession is period of significant economic decline, with lower industrial production or business activity and rising unemployment.

This doesn't apply to very short periods, and most economists use the definition of two consecutive quarters of falling Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the value of all goods and services a country produces.

Recessions may last for as little as a few months, however they can also be very persistent and can stretch for years.

Is the UK in a recession?

Britain is not officially in a recession yet, but it is approaching one, with GDP estimated to have fallen by 0.3% in the three months to August, according to the Office for National Statistics.

Story continues

The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee has warned the UK economy faces a ""challenging outlook"" as it approaches a ""prolonged recession"".

It cites a number of factors behind this including a huge hike in energy prices contributing to inflation, which is currently at 10.1% and putting pressure on households.

An overview of how the UK economy is performing (Yahoo News UK/Datawrapper)

The UK economy shrank 0.3% in August 2022 (Yahoo News UK/Flourish)

The committee says GDP is projected to continue to fall throughout 2023 and 2024, as high energy prices and materially tighter financial conditions weigh on spending.

It wasn't that long ago that the UK was last in a recession, with the economy tumbling in 2020 during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

As hospitality venues and shops were forced to close to stop the spread of the virus, hundreds companies went out of business and many people lost their jobs, as the UK's GDP fell by 20.4% between April and June 2020.

What does that mean for me?

The UK entering a recession is likely to mean more job losses, as people spend less money and businesses struggle to stay afloat.

Currently unemployment is at 3.5% - its lowest rate since 1974 - but the Bank of England predicts it to rise to 6.5% in the next two years.

The number of people placed into permanent jobs by recruitment agencies has fallen for the first time in 20 months, according to new research by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation.

A survey of 400 recruiters found many mentioned that heightened economic uncertainty had led some employers to reassess their recruitment plans, while candidate shortages also affected hiring plans.

With companies trying to keep their costs down, they are less likely to offer pay rises or promotions, even though many people may be seeking them to cope with rising inflation.

The cost of living crisis means many Britons are already feeling a squeeze on their standard of living, an a recession is likely to make this worse for many people.

Currently, the Bank expects inflation to fall back from the middle of next year towards the 2% target in two years' time.

To make matters worse, chancellor Jeremy Hunt is set to announce at least £35 billion in cuts as he seeks to plug a black hole in the Treasury's finances, so people can also expect cuts to public services.

The recessions of the early 80s and early 90s were characterised by large falls in employment and contributed to income inequality, so the same is likely to happen again as people lose their jobs.

Average pay is falling when adjusted for inflation (Yahoo News UK/Flourish)

Head of Education, Skills and Productivity at KPMG, Claire Warnes, added: “The looming recession is clearly impacting the UK jobs market.

""Employers’ caution in hiring combined with fewer available candidates has resulted in the number of permanent placements falling for the first time in nearly two years.

“Now more than ever, it’s essential that we focus on upskilling the workforce to support and boost economic recovery when it comes.

""The jobs market will bounce back, particularly if we invest in the skills of the workforce across all sectors of the economy.”

Meanwhile over five million households are set to see their monthly mortgage bills increase sharply over the next two years, by an average of around £3,900, according to the Resolution Foundation.

The think tank's research director James Smith said: ""Everyone will be affected by prolonged double-digit inflation, but poorer households will be hit hardest by the surge in food prices and energy bills.

“This provides a sobering backdrop for the Autumn Statement, where the Government will need to both calm the markets, while also protecting households from the worst of the cost-of-living storm.”"

Gross domestic product fell 0.2 per cent in the three months to September, meaning Britain is the only Group of Seven economy that has yet to fully recover from the pandemic, with output 0.4 per cent below pre-COVID levels.

The Bank of England has projected the UK will enter a recession at the end of the year. AP

In September alone, GDP dropped 0.6 per cent, reflecting an extra public holiday for the Queen’s funeral and the period of national mourning leading up to it. It was the second consecutive month of contraction.

Consumer spending and business investment both fell during the quarter, the Office for National Statistics said on Friday.

26d71b68-9db7-4485-aac9-36e0373c9142,"Britain's economy is forecast to shrink next year, finance minister Jeremy Hunt has said as he outlined how he and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will raise taxes and cut spending to repair the public finances, despite a grim outlook.

The new forecast is for gross domestic product to contract by 1.4 per cent next year compared with a projection for growth of 1.8 per cent in the previous outlook published in March by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).

Since then, Britain's economy has come under strain from an inflation rate now above 11 per cent, a slowing global economy and political and severe financial market volatility during Liz Truss's brief term as prime minister.

Hunt said the OBR forecasts laid out ""starkly the impact of global headwinds on the UK economy"" as he started a speech to parliament on Thursday.

The OBR forecast gross domestic product would grow by 1.3 per cent in 2024 and by 2.6 per cent in 2025, Hunt said, compared with its previous forecasts for growth of 2.1 per cent and 1.8 per cent respectively.

Hunt and Sunak have said they will restore investor confidence in Britain after the failed ""Trussonomics"" experiment with unfunded tax cuts that sent the pound to an all-time low against the US dollar, threatened chaos in the housing market and forced Truss to quit after just 50 days in Downing Street.

Hunt said the OBR judged that Britain - where high inflation is creating a cost-of-living crisis - is already in recession. It is the only Group of Seven nation yet to recover its pre-pandemic size, having previously suffered a decade of near-stagnant income growth.

Hunt said on Thursday he would freeze income tax allowances until 2028 and was lowering the threshold above which the 45 per cent top rate of income tax is paid to STG125,140 from STG150,000.

""Even after that, we will still have the most generous set of tax-free allowances of any G7 country,"" Hunt told parliament.

He had warned of more pain in his budget statement in the days leading up to Thursday's announcement.

Hunt also said the government would increase a windfall tax on oil and gas firms and extend it to power generation firms as he seeks to raise money to plug the hole in the public finances.

He said the levy would be increased to 35 per cent from its current rate of 25 per cent. It would also apply to electricity generators with a levy of 45 per cent being applied from January 1.

Hunt has said he can only slow the rise in borrowing costs if he can show investors that Britain's STG2.45 trillion debt mountain will start to fall as a share of economic output.

Critics have warned against a return to the kind of tight controls on spending pursued by the ruling Conservative Party for much of the past 12 years, saying it will hurt already stretched public services and the lives of millions of households, deepening the expected recession in the process."

The UK economy contracted by 0.2% in the latest quarter, as soaring prices hit businesses and consumers, putting the country on the brink of recession.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed that gross domestic product (GDP) shrank between July and September thanks to the sharp cost of living crisis, soaring inflation, and rising interest rates.

This was down from 0.2% growth in the previous three months, with the economy still 0.4% smaller than it was before the COVID-19 pandemic began.

However, the contraction was better than economists predicted, as they had previously forecast a fall of around 0.5% over the period.

In September alone, the British economy shrank by 0.6% as growth was affected by the bank holiday for Queen Elizabeth’s state funeral. Some businesses closed or operated differently on this day, the ONS said.

GDP fell 0.6% in September. Chart: ONS

The overall quarterly fall was driven by manufacturing, which saw widespread declines across most industries.

Services were flat overall, but consumer-facing industries fared badly, with a notable fall in retail. Services output fell 0.6% in September, following growth of 0.1% in August and 0.5% in July.

Production output fell by 1.5% between July to September — the fifth consecutive quarter of contraction, while construction output rose by 0.6%, a slowdown from the previous quarter, driven by a rise in new orders in the quarter.

“I am under no illusion that there is a tough road ahead — one which will require extremely difficult decisions to restore confidence and economic stability. But to achieve long-term, sustainable growth, we need to grip inflation, balance the books and get debt falling. There is no other way,” chancellor Jeremy Hunt said.

“While the world economy faces extreme turbulence, the fundamental resilience of the British economy is cause for optimism in the long run.”

Watch: How does inflation affect interest rates?

A surge in UK energy bills this year has hit disposable incomes, which in turn has left households with less to spend on goods and services. The rise in energy bills has also put pressure on businesses across the country.

The crisis is expected to deepen over the winter months amid double-digit inflation, rising interest rates and household energy bills climbing higher again in October.

The Bank of England (BoE) has already warned that the looming recession will be the longest on record. A technical recession is when a country’s economy shrinks for two quarters in a row.

Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Wealth Club, said: ""Were it not for the disruption caused by the Queen's funeral — during which many businesses shut — it's just possible the UK economy could have scraped a positive performance in Q3.

""But despite that perhaps surprisingly strong result, the Q3 GDP announcement is full of warning signs. Inflation is squeezing consumer spending, inward investment has fallen and supply constraints are restricting activity in the manufacturing and construction sectors.

""The mini-budget turmoil only kicked in right at the end of the period — and that is likely to have left Q4 off to a poor start.

He added: ""With consumers battening down the hatches for a tough winter and the government proposing substantial tax rises and spending cuts, we think the economy will shrink again in Q4 — officially pushing the UK into recession.""

The weak economic outlook will now make for some difficult decisions in next week's budget.

Alpesh Paleja, CBI lead economist, said: ""A weaker growth outlook and persistently high inflation will make for some difficult decisions on economic policy. The Autumn Statement must learn the lessons of the 2010s: fiscal sustainability and lifting trend growth are both immediate priorities.

""Alongside reassuring markets and protecting the most vulnerable, the government should safeguard capital spending and investment allowances to drive private sector growth.""

The numbers: The Australian sharemarket held steady on Monday, down just 0.16 per cent at close, despite a positive start off the back of news that China would relax some of its COVID-19 restrictions.

The S&P/ASX200 was 11.70 points lower, to 7146.30 at close, with healthy gains by the big miners responsible for holding the index stable.

The lifters: Champion Iron, Core Lithium and Fortescue Metals were some of the best performing stocks of the day, jumping 12.92, 11.68 and 10.08 per cent respectively."
174fee09-af89-4e5e-a43b-85ca02dcc4b6,"SINGAPORE: The dollar firmed on Monday as sentiment soured after China said it is sticking with its strict COVID restrictions, quashing hopes of an imminent reopening in the world's second-largest economy which had earlier fired a broad rally in riskier assets.

China said over the weekend that it will persevere with its ""dynamic-clearing"" approach to COVID-19 cases as soon as they emerge, giving little indication it would ease its outlier zero-COVID strategy nearly three years into the pandemic.

The dollar gained 0.55% on the Chinese offshore yuan to 7.2141, while the risk-sensitive Australian and New Zealand dollars were also among the biggest losers, both falling nearly 1% in early Asia trade.

The Aussie was last down 0.7% at $0.6426, while the kiwi fell 0.6% to $0.5893.

The two currencies were huge beneficiaries of a broad rally on Friday - rising nearly 3% - as speculation that China could soon end its COVID restrictions gathered pace and buoyed risk appetite.

""People are kind of thinking there's going to be an eventual opening... but it's not obvious to me that there's an imminent reopening due, and I think it's kind of premature,"" said Alvin Tan, head of Asia FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets.

The economic impact of China's zero-COVID policy was again highlighted in trade figures released on Monday, which showed exports and imports unexpectedly contracted in October, the first simultaneous slump since May 2020.

Elsewhere, sterling edged 0.3% lower to $1.1340, while the euro slipped 0.1% to $0.9949, erasing some of their roughly 2% jump on Friday.

""Any rally in the Aussie, as well as the other currencies, will likely prove short-lived, given China is still very committed to its approach to the COVID outbreaks,"" said Carol Kong, a currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA).

Against the Japanese yen, the dollar was up 0.32% at 147.14.

Investors were also assessing Friday's U.S. jobs report which showed that firms added a more-than-expected 261,000 jobs in October and hourly wages continued to rise, evidence of a still-tight labour market.

But hints of some easing of market conditions, with the unemployment rate rising to 3.7%, fuelled hopes that the much sought after Fed pivot could be on the horizon, capping the dollar's gains.

Against a basket of currencies, the U.S. dollar index last stood at 111.02. It had lost almost 2% at the end of last week.

""It was, overall, a pretty mixed report,"" said CBA's Kong. ""Judging by market reaction, investors really focused on the lift in unemployment rate, and that might have led to market participants scaling back their expectations on the Fed funds rate.""

Four Federal Reserve policymakers on Friday also indicated they would still consider a smaller interest rate hike at their next policy meeting.

Fed funds futures now show that markets are pricing in a 69% chance of a 50-basis-point rate hike at the Fed's December meeting, with the next key data point being Thursday's U.S. inflation figures. - Reuters"

BEIJING (AP) — Asian stock markets followed Wall Street lower on Thursday ahead of a U.S. inflation update that will likely influence Federal Reserve plans for more interest rate hikes after elections left control of Congress uncertain.

Hong Kong’s market benchmark fell by more than 2%. Shanghai, Tokyo and Sydney also declined. Oil prices edged lower.

Wall Street’s benchmark S&P 500 index lost 2.1% as investors watched vote-counting from Tuesday’s congressional elections to see whether Republicans take control, possibly leading to changes that can unsettle markets. Investors were rattled by the crypto industry’s latest crisis of confidence and weaker profit reports from The Walt Disney Co. and some other companies.

Forecasters expect U.S. government data Thursday to show surging inflation eased in September but stayed near a four-decade high. That might reinforce arguments by some Fed officials that rates have to stay high for an extended period to slow economic activity and extinguish inflation.

“There are upside risks” of higher inflation than expected, said Michael Every of Rabobank in a report. “If so, expect more market pain.”

Investors worry rate hikes this year by the Fed and central banks in Europe and Asia to cool inflation might tip the global economy into recession.

The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong tumbled 2.3% to 15,980.61 and the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo shed 1.2% to 27,391.00. The Shanghai Composite Index gave up 0.5% to 3,034.21.

The Kospi in Seoul declined 0.5% to 2,412.93 and Sydney’s S&P-ASX 200 sank 0.4% to 6,971.90. New Zealand and Jakarta gained while Singapore and Malaysia declined.

On Wall Street, the S&P 500 declined to 3,748.57, erasing most of its gains from a three-day rally leading up to Election Day.

Disney sank 13.2% for the largest loss in the S&P 500 after reporting quarterly results that fell short of analysts’ expectations.

Facebook parent Meta Platforms rose 5.2% after saying it will cut costs by laying off 11,000 employees, or about 13% of its workforce. It is down nearly 70% for the year.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2% to 32,513.94. The Nasdaq composite tumbled 2.5% to 10,353.17.

Republicans were within nine seats of the 218 needed to control the House of Representatives as votes still were being counted in some states. Control of the Senate depended on races in Nevada and Arizona that hadn’t been decided.

The outcome will determine how the next two years of President Joe Biden’s term play out. Republicans are likely to launch a spate of investigations into Biden, his family and his administration if they take power. A GOP takeover of the Senate would hobble the president’s ability to appoint judges.

Also Wednesday, cryptocurrencies fell amid worries about the industry’s financial strength after a big player, Binance, called off a deal to buy troubled rival FTX. That at least temporarily ended hopes for a bailout after FTX users scrambled to pull out their money.

Bitcoin fell 14% from a day earlier to $15,900. That is down 77% from last year’s high of $69,000.

Traders hope indicators that show U.S. housing sales and other activity weakening might prompt the Fed to back off plans for more rate hikes. Fed officials have said rates likely will be kept elevated for an extended period until inflation is extinguished.

Forecasters expect Thursday’s data to show inflation decelerated to 7.9% in September from the previous month’s 8.3%. However, prices were expected to rise 0.6% compared with August, accelerating from July’s 0.1% increase.

Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices to show a clearer trend, is expected to accelerate to 6.5% from August’s 6.3%. That suggests costs of rent, medical services, autos and other goods and services still are rising in response to strong demand.

Traders expect the Fed to raise rates again next month but by a smaller margin of one-half percentage point after a series of 0.75 percentage-point increases. The Fed’s key lending rate is a range of 3.75% to 4%, up from close to zero in March. A growing number of investors expect it to exceed 5% next year.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which helps dictate rates for mortgages and other loans, fell to 4.08% from 4.13% late Tuesday. The two-year yield, which tends to more closely track expectations for Fed action, dropped to 4.60% from 4.66%.

In energy markets, benchmark U.S. crude shed 8 cents to $85.75 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the price basis for international oil trading, lost 3 cents to $92.62 per barrel in London.

The dollar gained to 146.16 yen from Wednesday’s 145.56 yen. The euro declined to $1.0024 from $1.0073."

US stocks soared as much as 4% early Thursday after October's CPI report showed a decline in inflation.

The annual US inflation rate was up 7.7% in October, which was below economist estimates of 7.9%.

The 10-year US Treasury yield plunged 20 basis points as expectations of a Fed pivot grow.

US stocks soared as much as 4% early Thursday after the October consumer price index showed a cooldown in inflation, potentially giving the Federal Reserve some breathing room in its current interest rate hiking cycle.

The CPI rose 7.7% on an annual basis, below economist estimates for a rise of 7.9%. On a monthly basis, it climbed 0.4% in October, below estimates for a rise of 0.6%. Meanwhile, core monthly inflation, which excludes food and energy, increased 0.3%, below estimates for a rise of 0.5%.

The move in assets was immediate following the CPI release, with the 10-year US Treasury yield plunging an immediate 20 basis points. The move isn't a surprise to JPMorgan, which estimated a CPI reading of 7.7% would spark a 2.5% to 3.5% surge in the S&P 500.

Here's where US indexes stood shortly after the 9:30 a.m. ET open on Thursday:

""Hard to believe that a 7.7% year over year inflation rate is reason for celebration, but the 0.3% monthly change in core CPI reduces pressure on the Fed to raise rates another 0.75% at their next meeting,"" Bryce Doty of Sit Fixed Income Advisors told Insider.

(Reuters) - Juul Labs Inc has secured an investment from some of its early investors that will keep the e-cigarette maker in business, the company said on Thursday, adding that it will also undertake job cuts as part of a reorganization.

The once red-hot vaping company plans to lay off about 400 people and reduce its operating budget by 30% to 40%.

The company said the investment would help Juul run its business operations, while it goes ahead with its administrative appeal of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's marketing denial order related to its e-cigarettes.

The company did not disclose the size of the investment.

Last month, the Wall Street Journal reported Juul was preparing to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy while searching for an alternative — such as a sale, investment or loan — that could stave off a filing.

Juul's e-cigarettes were briefly banned in the U.S. in late June after the FDA concluded that the company had failed to show that the sale of its products would be appropriate for public health. But following an appeal, the health regulator put the ban on hold and agreed to an additional review of Juul's marketing application.

In July, the company said it was in the early stages of exploring options including financing alternatives, as it had to deal with lawsuits related to marketing of its e-cigarettes.

The financing is the first piece of a bailout package under discussion with two of Juul's biggest investors, Hyatt Hotels heir Nick Pritzker and California investor Riaz Valani, according a Journal report on Thursday.

In late September, Marlboro maker Altria Group Inc, which partly owns Juul, exercised the option to be released from its non-compete deal with the e-cigarette company almost four years after buying a 35% stake in the company.

A person familiar with the plan told The Associated Press the layoffs include 400 staffers and are part of a cost-saving plan to immediately cut Juul's operating budget by 30% to 40%.

A Juul spokesperson told FOX Business the company has received an investment of capital that will help it maintain business operations and challenge plans by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ban its products.

""To further secure the company's ability to continue moving forward, we are also undertaking a reorganization, including the difficult but necessary step of separating from many valued colleagues,"" the spokesperson said. ""Look ahead, Juul Labs remains committed to advancing its mission of harm reduction for adult smokers while combating underage use.""

CALIFORNIA VOTING LEADS TO BAN OF FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS

The new cash infusion came from two early Juul investors: Nicholas Pritzker, head of Hyatt Hotels, and Riaz Valani, a private equity specialist based in San Francisco, according to The Associated Press.

The San Francisco company rocketed to the top of the U.S. vaping market five years ago on the popularity of flavors like mango, mint and creme brulee. But rampant teen use fueled a backlash and triggered a series of government actions that have forced the company to drop all U.S. advertising and discontinue most of its flavors.

The company suffered another major blow in June when the FDA rejected the company's application to keep its product on the market as a smoking alternative for adults. The FDA has placed a temporary hold on its initial decision while Juul files an appeal.

Another setback came in September when the company's largest investor, Marlboro-maker Altria, said it would resume competing on its own in the e-cigarette space forcing Juul to battle for space on retail shelves.

Juul's share of the $5.5 billion retail market, meanwhile, has plummeted to about 33% from a high of 75% several years ago.

Despite its decline in popularity among U.S. teens, Juul remains a target for politicians in Washington and throughout the country seeking to crack down on youth vaping.

In September, Juul announced it would pay $440 million to settle an investigation by nearly three dozen states into its marketing practices and their contribution to the spike in underage vaping. Juul still faces nine separate lawsuits from other states. And thousands of personal lawsuits filed by individual and families have been consolidated in a California federal district court.

The backlash against teen vaping triggered a series of government actions that have forced the company into retreat. Since 2019, Juul has dropped all U.S. advertising and discontinued most of its flavors.

The FDA said Juul did not adequately address key questions about the potential for chemicals to leech from its device. The FDA has placed a temporary hold on its initial decision while Juul files an appeal.

Another setback came in September when the company's largest investor, tobacco giant Altria, announced plans to resume competing on its own in the e-cigarette space.

Altria pulled its own e-cigarettes off the market in 2018 after taking a nearly $13 billion stake in Juul. But that investment has lost more than 95% of its value as Juul’s prospects have dimmed, giving Altria the option to exit its non-compete agreement.

The decision means Juul could soon be forced to battle for space on retail shelves with Marlboro-maker Altria, along with longstanding competitors like Reynolds American's Vuse, which recently edged past Juul to become the leading U.S. vaping brand.

Washington — Embattled vaping company Juul Labs announced hundreds of layoffs Thursday as the company weathers lawsuits, government bans and increasing competition for its electronic cigarettes.

Juul said it has obtained new financing to stay in business and continue operations, which includes challenging plans by the Food and Drug Administration to ban its products.

The layoffs include 400 staffers and are part of a cost-saving plan to immediately cut Juul's operating budget by 30% to 40%, according to a person familiar with the plan who requested anonymity to discuss its details. The new cash infusion came from two early Juul investors: Nicholas Pritzker, head of Hyatt Hotels, and Riaz Valani, a private equity specialist based in San Francisco, according to the same person.

For weeks, industry analysts have speculated that Juul could soon declare bankruptcy or sell itself to another company. Thursday’s announcement appears to have at least delayed any move in that direction.

“This investment will allow Juul Labs to maintain business operations, continue advancing its administrative appeal of the FDA’s marketing denial order and support product innovation and science generation,” a company spokesperson wrote in an email.

The Wall Street Journal first reported the news Thursday morning.

Juul rocketed to the top of the U.S. vaping market five years ago on the popularity of flavors like mango, mint and creme brulee. But the San Francisco company’s rise was fueled by use among teenagers, some of whom became hooked on Juul’s high-nicotine pods.

The backlash against teen vaping triggered a series of government actions that have forced the company into retreat. Since 2019, Juul has dropped all U.S. advertising and discontinued most of its flavors.

The biggest blow came in June when the Food and Drug Administration rejected the company’s application to keep its product on the market as a smoking alternative for adults, throwing its future into uncertainty. The FDA said Juul did not adequately address key questions about the potential for chemicals to leach from its device. The FDA has placed a temporary hold on its initial decision while Juul files an appeal.

Another setback came in September when the company's largest investor, tobacco giant Altria, announced plans to resume competing on its own in the e-cigarette space.

Altria pulled its own e-cigarettes off the market in 2018 after taking a nearly $13 billion stake in Juul. But that investment has lost more than 95% of its value as Juul’s prospects have dimmed, giving Altria the option to exit its non-compete agreement.

The decision means Juul could soon be forced to battle for space on retail shelves with Marlboro-maker Altria, along with longstanding competitors like Reynolds American's Vuse, which recently edged past Juul to become the leading U.S. vaping brand.

Juul’s share of the $5.5 billion retail market has plummeted to about 33% from a high of 75% several years ago.

While Juul is no a longer popular with U.S. teens, the company remains a target for politicians in Washington and throughout the country seeking to crackdown on youth vaping.

In September, Juul announced it would pay $440 million to settle an investigation by nearly three dozen states into its marketing practices and their contribution to the spike in underage vaping. Juul still faces nine lawsuits from other states. And thousands of personal lawsuits filed by individual and families have been consolidated in a California federal district court."
b21c265e-bc6a-4fb6-80b1-dc691828aa83,"The hottest show in town over the past week or so has been Elon Musk’s chaotic takeover of Twitter, which is less like a usual merger or acquisition and more like gladiatorial spectacle.

Whether Twitter is beginning a long and painful death rattle is certainly a live possibility. It’s clear Musk genuinely did not want to close the deal until the company’s legal action forced his hand, and that $44 billion was a completely absurd price for him to pay.

The spectre that Musk — the dog who caught the car — might not succeed in his quest to make Twitter profitable does raise some interesting questions. Should he fail, most people will probably wander in a daze to whatever the next big thing is. But for my fellow media elites, it might not be such an easy question.

As a social media platform, Twitter has always been a bit of a strange outlier. It has remained largely text-based, even as other platforms become ever more obsessed with video. It has always struggled to attract large numbers of users, launch useful new features, or make consistent revenue. But despite these limitations, which probably would have crippled any of its rivals, it has managed to maintain its position as the favoured online space for discourse by people who are in the news; who write the news; and who court the news.

I don’t just mean the fact Donald Trump used Twitter as the command centre for his presidential ambitions. Twitter is the staging ground for the fuzzy intersection of politics, culture, entertainment and media; a place where the aristocratic class of digital society come together to both talk shop and get at each other’s throats with equal enthusiasm. This daily psychodrama is mostly extremely annoying for anyone who has to witness it, but it is undeniably part of what keeps the website chugging along and has outsized reverberations through society at large.

Few have benefited more from this state of affairs than journalists. The figure of the Twitter-obsessed journo who spends their whole day on the website and has their blinkered worldview shaped by what transpires on their feed has become a popular stereotype, and one that does contain a grain of truth.

Twitter, despite never quite reaching the concrete value to news organisations that Facebook did at its peak, has become integral to news production, distribution and brand-building for journalists. It’s where a disproportionate amount of news gathering, source finding and hiring occurs. As a natural consequence, it shapes the contours of the news cycle in ways both subtle and overt, as journalists both draw from Twitter and anticipate what Twitter’s response might be to any given story.

This has of course led to a great deal of bellyaching from all quarters. Journalists and editors who cut their teeth in the pre-digital age don’t like how Twitter distorts the newsmaking process and makes personal brand paramount, whereas others grouse over the fact Twitter has made micro-celebrities and influencers out of employees of the digital media machine. (You can look at Musk’s crusade against the blue verified check as an effort to take away what he sees as undeserved status for the media elite, who probably should have learned to code.)

But amid the roiling chaos of a Twitter trying to find its feet amid mass layoffs and a mercurial new boss, it’s interesting to imagine what journalism might look like without it. No platform stands ready to truly replace the role Twitter occupies in the media industry, no matter how many well-intentioned people pretend the clunky weirdness of Mastodon is the future. And let’s not kid ourselves that the vast majority of journos have the panache to make it on TikTok.

Either way, we’re staring down the barrel of a genuinely destabilising event for journalism — the latest in a long line of such events. Twitter has been background frequency for the industry for a decade. It’s hard to imagine something replacing it.

Looking at the chaotic first weeks of Musk’s Twitter ownership, alongside his own admission that bankruptcy is very much on the table, it’s easy to imagine his free speech rescue mission going up in flames.

If anything will save Twitter, it’s that it has managed to secure itself a virtually unchallenged place among a certain subset of the internet’s most powerful users.



If Musk can figure out a pathway to eke money out of those users without completely alienating everyone else, he might be able to battle through significant headwinds and make it work. I wouldn’t hold my breath."
4debc154-9f82-4fc0-93d5-90edbee28cc2,"Twitter’s entire history has been marked by unclear monetisation attempts and baffling management, so in that sense not much has changed since Elon Musk took over as owner and chief executive. But all over the service, people are on edge.

It’s easy to see why Musk’s constant compulsive tweeting, petty complaints, conspiracy theorising and inconsistent stance on moderation – paired with concerning news reports and the fact that he’s literally the richest person on the planet – would lead people to assume the service is heading for a fiery end. But his ownership hasn’t had a direct impact on the functionality of the platform as yet.

Elon Musk has variously promised to protect free speech, limit the reach of people who don’t pay for verification, and ban Twitter users who impersonate others. Credit:AP

Reflexively, the fact that 90 per cent of the content on Twitter is suddenly about Twitter itself – about how doomed it is, about how people should jump to alternatives such as Mastodon – is the primary factor in making Twitter seem doomed, and driving interest in alternatives.

Time will tell whether Musk follows through on the various initiatives he’s blurted out and whether they’ll have a noticeable effect on the service for most users. But as of now, Twitter remains a unique platform, and those searching for alternatives don’t have many easy options. Mastodon has emerged as a popular recommendation, but it’s an early platform with a lot of friction for new users, and a fraction of the functionality Twitter users are accustomed to."
8df27716-ee0a-4e4e-9774-04e81d6b8700,"Twitter's new CEO and owner Elon Musk is rattling the cage at his social network and ruffling a lot of feathers both inside and outside of the company. But while some in the tech world describe that kind of chaos as a garbage fire, others see it as something very different: an opportunity.

Years-old federated social networks, legacy social platforms that have their own issues and a cacophony of pre-existing fringe efforts are all emerging as possible alternatives to Twitter. And in that vein, so are completely new ideas.

One of these is being hatched by Gabor Cselle, a repeat founder who wants to build what he described to me as ""a new Twitter.""

In true Valley hustle style, Gabor is still honing in on small details like a name and what, exactly, all this will entail. He's doing that in real time, with a multi-tabbed Google Doc that you can view.

But as a first step to gathering interest for his New Twitter, Gabor has put together a sign-up list for people to register their interest as he works away. (Note: The name on the sign-up page, T2, appears to be an abbreviation for Twitter 2, but Gabor says this is just a placeholder name.)

Now you might be asking yourself, why pay attention to this? Isn't Gabor getting a little ahead of himself here? He doesn't have a name, or even a product, yet.

Well, yes. Gabor is in that sense just one of hundreds of millions of founders out in the world noodling on ideas. But there are a few things that set him and his alt-Twitter effort apart.

For starters, he's a repeat founder who sold his first company, the YC-based mobile email startup reMail, to Google. His second company, the native advertising startup Namo Media, he sold to Twitter itself.

He's worked on products at those two titans between and after those acquisitions, and that experience -- he focused on Timeline, new-user onboarding and logged-out experiences at Twitter; and on many, many different consumer ideas as director at Area 120, Google's in-house incubator project -- has given him a taste of what's interesting, and what is not. And also what works, and what does not.

Story continues

Gabor left Google in July 2022 and has since been tweeting out his daily journey to figure out what to do next. (Day 106, for example, was spent at TechCrunch Disrupt, where he came to see Paul Davison, another hustler, talk about the highlights of Clubhouse and the low lights of Highlight.) Gabor's public chronicle has been giving him some Twitter-style viral momentum and attention and, naturally, insight into conversation about Twitter itself.

He tells me that Elon's initial mobilization to buy Twitter led to a huge whir of interest among his friends and contacts, who chattered in downcast tones about how the whole place would fall apart.

Then, Musk did buy it. And then, the layoffs hit -- a tipping point for Gabor.

""I had been thinking about a new Twitter for a while,"" he said. ""But after multiple friends of mine still at the company were laid off last week, I thought to myself, 'This is the thing I’ve been thinking about for so long! Maybe this is the time.'""

Gabor is long on big-picture ideas at the moment.

""I want to build the next public square for discussion. I want it to be delightful and fun, rewarding and valuable, and safe from harassment,"" he tells me. ""We’ve had 15-20 years of content moderation experience on the internet now, and so let’s build that in.""

He's also a big fan of Andrew Chen's Cold Start concept. For his own cold start, Gabor is focusing first on coalescing a critical mass of people -- a community to hit the ground running when ""T2"" launches. According to the Google Doc, this is currently set to be September 2023, a date Gabor tells me he might try to move up.

He's even had some investor interest, which he has been building via iMessage. That inbox includes a former Twitter-exec-turned-investor who he will not name, who has already texted asking how much money Gabor would like to have to get this new bird off the ground.

And he's had plenty of unsolicited advice. Twitter is great for that.

""Someone asked last week, why doesn’t someone just start a new Twitter? It would only take three days and $50 million,"" he said. ""That's what got me first to ask what a roadmap might look like. I think for me it wouldn't be a three-day build, but it also doesn't take $50 million.""

This brings up many other questions... not least why he thinks he can build what Twitter has never managed to build itself, or why yet more centralized social media walled gardens have any future at all given all the problems we've seen in the ones we have today.

For now, his hunch is what he has: Creating something from scratch will be easier than trying to fix something that's already big and in operation, and that it definitely won't be as simple as just bringing together what he calls ""the best people,"" but also not impossible.

""I think right now I’m seeing this empty space,"" he said, ""and I want to be in that space.""

e0856f46-9d94-484b-9ef9-b715ef33b3f4,"(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk, in his first address to Twitter Inc. employees since purchasing the company for $44 billion, said that bankruptcy was a possibility if it doesn’t start generating more cash, according to people familiar with the matter.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The warning came amid a tumultuous start to Musk’s reign at the social media company -- a two-week period in which he has fired half of Twitter’s staff, ushered out most of the top executives and ordered the remaining employees to stop working from home. One executive who until Thursday had emerged as part of Musk’s new leadership team, Yoel Roth, departed, people familiar with the situation said. Another, Robin Wheeler, also resigned -- but Musk persuaded her to stay on, said some of the people, who requested anonymity to protect personal and professional relationships.

While the buyout has removed Twitter from the scrutiny of public markets, Musk loaded the company with almost $13 billion of debt that’s now in the hands of seven Wall Street banks that have been unable to offload it to investors.

Confidence in the company has eroded so rapidly that, even before Musk’s bankruptcy comments, some funds were offering to buy the loans for as little as 60 cents on the dollar -- a price typically reserved for companies deemed in financial distress, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday.

In his address to staff, Musk issued multiple dour warnings. Employees should brace for 80-hour work weeks. There will be fewer office perks like free food. And he ended the pandemic-era flexibility that allowed employees to work from home.

“If you don’t want to come, resignation accepted,” he said, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Story continues

When he was asked about the prospect of attrition, Musk said, “We all need to be more hardcore.”

In discussing Twitter’s finances and future, Musk said the company needed to move with urgency to make its $8 subscription product, Twitter Blue, something users will want to pay for, given a pullback by advertisers who are concerned about harmful content.

Musk has in the past used the threat of financial ruin in an attempt to motivate workers, according to a person familiar with his management style. He’s trying to convey the notion that if people don’t work hard, Twitter will be left in a very difficult spot, this person said.

The Information and Platformer earlier reported Musk’s bankruptcy statement.

He also hinted at products he’d like to introduce, including payments, ads that are more conversational and interest-bearing checking accounts. Onboarding to the Twitter app should be smoother, as is the case with TikTok, he said.

Earlier Thursday, Twitter’s chief information security officer, chief privacy officer and chief compliance officer departed, raising concerns about the company’s ability to keep its platform secure and comply with regulations. Twitter is currently bound by a consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission that regulates how the company handles user data, and could be subject to fines for violations.

Roth had since taken over all of the social network’s Trust and Safety efforts, while Wheeler, a sales vice president, had recently stepped up to oversee relations with jittery advertisers. She hinted at her decision to stay in a tweet, as well as a post on an internal Slack channel.

The debt Twitter took on to finance Musk’s buyout is leaving it with interest costs that, by one estimate, will surge to $1.2 billion a year.

The social network has seen a pullback from some advertisers that are concerned about Musk’s plans for content moderation.

Debt investors and credit raters are also showing little confidence. The company’s banks have been quietly sounding out hedge funds and other asset managers for their interest in buying a chunk of the company’s debt.

Discussions so far have centered around the $6.5 billion leveraged loan portion of the financing, people with knowledge of the talks said. Banks had seemed unwilling to sell for any price below 70 cents on the dollar, according to one of the people. Even at that level, losses could run into the billions of dollars, Bloomberg calculations show.

Moody’s Investors Service, meanwhile, recently cut Twitter’s credit rating deeper into junk territory. “Twitter’s governance risk is highly negative reflecting Moody’s expectation for aggressive financial policies and concentrated ownership by Elon Musk,” the ratings firm said.

Musk in an email late Wednesday warned employees of “difficult times ahead,” with “no way to sugarcoat the message” about the economic outlook for the company. He ended employees’ ability to work remotely unless he personally approved it.

17c19c1f-9ca8-44c7-a64d-db425c33fcf9,"Elon Musk’s Layoffs Cut Deep Into Twitter’s Engineering Department, Document Shows

Headlines about the massive job losses at Twitter have focused on the big numbers — half of the 7,500-strong team left without a position, trying to find employment when their contracts run out on January 3, and in the meantime feeling unwanted at headquarters in San Francisco. (Unless, of course, you’re one of the folks Elon Musk has decided he fired in error, in which case, sorry, please come back, he’s sorry hefired you.)

However, little detail has surfaced about where those cuts came. We know that Twitter’s communications team, which explains to the world the weird whims of its new billionaire owner, has been reduced from nearly 100 to just two. Gizmodo understands that’s now at most one: one of the two staff remaining has since left the company, and it’s uncertain whether the other remains.

But beyond that, it’s been difficult to discern definitively which teams have been affected the most, but analysis of a spreadsheet created by Chandan Maloo, a Twitter staff engineer since May 2021, and filled out by fired Twitter employees touting their skills and roles to would-be employers, does shed some light. The #oneteam Tweeps Talent Directory contains the names of some 830 of those fired in Musk’s 3,750-person bloodbath: that means around one in five of all those cut from Twitter are on the list.

The spreadsheet gives some insight into where the ax fell the hardest. Of the 830 staff let go who have signed up to the spreadsheet, 360 have the word “engineer” in their job title. (A sample of the job titles were cross-checked with associated LinkedIn data to ensure the spreadsheet’s contents were legitimate.) They include 26 machine learning engineers, who may find themselves snapped up by AI companies looking to fill out desks with former big tech staff. The majority of the laid off employees were based in the U.S.

Engineers are the worst affected by the layoffs in sheer numbers, according to the spreadsheet – with the obvious caveat that those filling out their details to be included are self-selecting, and likely reflect the communities in which the spreadsheet is shared on LinkedIn. Engineers are more likely to follow fellow engineers than, say, marketing staff (28 of whom have lost their jobs and filled out their details, per the document), the 14 ex-employees who have “communications” in their job title, or the dozen recruitment staff who have now found themselves out of work. After engineers, product managers appeared to be the next worst affected job title; 24 members of Twitter’s curation team have also added their name to the list.

One Twitter employee who avoided being cut and is still working at the company within the engineering team, says that the proportion of engineering staff included in the layoff spreadsheet “sounds about right” based on his experience of how staffing has changed on the team.

Beyond the material impact on the platform, the halving of the workforce has a human impact, too. Just short of 200 staff members had visa support from Twitter that has now been taken away from them, according to the spreadsheet.

The range of experience among those laid off varied significantly, from some who were in their first year in the tech industry to one senior software engineer with 40 years’ experience, according to the spreadsheet. The LinkedIn profile of the software engineer – who Gizmodo is not identifying to protect his identity – suggests he was at Twitter for less than nine months before he was fired. He did not immediately respond to an interview request.

That has obvious deleterious effects on the stability of Twitter, the website and app, as users are finding out: phantom tweets disappear, follower counts fluctuate, and GIFs glitch into obsolescence. “I would be surprised if those staff were just sitting around all day doing nothing,” says Ian Brown, an information security and privacy researcher and visiting professor at FGV University in Buenos Aires, Brazil. “I would have thought they were there for a good reason, and maintaining a high availability global service like Twitter takes a lot of global resources.”

The layoffs have also massively disrupted the engineering department and its normal workflow. “Our previous software model was very incremental,” says the current Twitter engineer. Engineers would push a service and watch how it performed, he says. They would then find some way to improve it, make those improvements, then push it again. They’d then watch again and find something else to improve. Now, it’s a free-for-all, where major new features are being deployed into Twitter’s code base without prior checking, with the obvious chaotic effects.

It’s an assessment that Foone Turing, a programmer who has previously worked at Google, agrees with. “A lot of known situations can be automated – rebooting machines, cleaning out temp files and logs, and fallover,” she says, “but the problem is the issues you don’t expect.”

Turing says that engineering staffing reductions affect “things like ‘nobody knew that system A was dependent on system B to boot, and system B was dependent on system A to boot, until they both happened to go down at the same time’”. Turing points out that is an example that happened to them at one of their former jobs.

The scale, brutality and way in which the layoffs were enacted makes Twitter’s position even trickier. The way they’ve been enacted could be contrasted with those at Stripe, where CEO Patrick Collison emailed staff to let them know why a 14% reduction in headcount was taking place. Unlike Twitter, Stripe’s CEO appears to have informed his HR department about the imminent layoffs. Staff were also told about the layoffs with a signed email by Collison, rather than an unsigned message from “Twitter”. Musk’s method of laying off staff also compares poorly with Meta’s 11,000-strong layoffs, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg informed them of with an apology while also guaranteeing large amounts of severance to those employees losing their job."
d5e18fb0-07d3-417a-b451-c3f9c955a14a,"Elon Musk officially moved Twitter into his own cage last week. The world’s richest man has wasted no time making changes at the social media company, firing top executives and dissolving the board of directors.

More bloodletting has come on the weekend. As much as half of Twitter’s 7500-strong workforce has been laid off. The company also launched plans to charge Twitter users $US8 a month for a verified account, which looks odd.

Musk said he did not buy Twitter to make more money but “to try to help humanity, whom I love”. AP

Musk will need all the cost savings and revenues he can get. His $US44 billion ($68 billion) acquisition of the world’s “digital town square” is one of the largest leveraged buyouts in history. To fund the deal, Musk loaded Twitter – loss-making for 10 of the past 12 years – with $US12.7 billion of debt.

Analysts say net interest expense will climb from $US51 million last year to over $US1 billion a year as a result. Having vastly overpaid to free “the bird”, Musk will face an uphill battle to keep Twitter in the air financially.

For starters, his plans to offer a premium subscription service for $US8 a month risks backfiring. Assume that the number of its own (blue check) verified users followed by Twitter, roughly 424,000, is correct. Even if every verified user will pay the fee to keep their blue check, that will just generate $US41 million a year in revenue. That would not even cover 5 per cent of Twitter’s estimated annual interest payments."

Apparently, things at the birdsite aren’t going so great. Actually, the so-called “microphone of the masses” is in pretty bad shape. Bad enough that genius-billionaire investor Elon Musk is now reportedly telling his staff (more of whom he says he intends to lay off) that bankruptcy is now on the table.

This according to multiple news sources privy to the goings-on at the company, including the New York Times and Platformer, the tech publication of former Verge editor Casey Newton.

By noon, the number of verified popes — that is, the bishop of Rome and earthly representative of Christ — had multiplied exponentially. A major pharmaceutical company had seemingly declared the drug insulin free for all. And at least one individual whose username betrayed a deep love of Adolf Hitler had obtained Twitter’s verified blessing.

Meanwhile, NPR was reportedly warning the journalists it employs not to delete their accounts — for fear they’d be immediately impersonated. And the Pentagon was said to be unsure of what to with its own account, according to Afghan War vet-turned-reporter Steve Beynon.

At time of writing, Twitter’s brand new head of trust and safety — who replaced the one Musk fired last month — and the head of its sales and marketing were said to be looking for a way to permanently exit the building. The executive pair, Yoel Roth and Robin Wheeler, respectively, not 30 hours ago took part in a Q&A on Musk’s behalf, the aim of which was purportedly reassuring advertisers that everything was not, as it appeared, going to shit.

All this absolute chaos led the editor in chief of one national magazine to wonder aloud Wednesday whether the people bankrolling Musk’s takeover actually worked for his biggest social media rivals. (“Would he be acting any differently?”)

Gizmodo was unable to reach out to Twitter for comment, as the Verge also reported today, there is no one left in the office that used to take those calls."
d70e9d58-3572-4474-88cb-116fde1d6b71,"I honestly did not think chaos would engulf Twitter so quickly, but I must admit: this rules. This owns so hard. Awoooou (wolf howl), Twitter is good again. We’re no longer locked in here with Elon Musk — Elon Musk has locked himself in here with us.

Musk took control of Twitter on October 27th. Since then:

Twitter, however, is an acquisition and is not necessarily full of Musk fans. That means it’s a much less forgiving environment for Musk. Like, an early subset of Twitter users are Something Awful forum goons — the most prominent of whom is Dril — and they love fucking with people. Plus, Musk’s Twitter Blue plan to devalue verification check marks motivated a bunch of people who didn’t like Musk to go out with a bang by impersonating him, largely because they knew it would make him mad. And it probably did! Certainly, that would explain why his very first policy change was to increase punishment for impersonation.

Shenanigans are fun, but here’s the thing to keep in mind: Twitter is loaded with debt from the acquisition and needs to pay roughly $1 billion a year on it. In 2021, Twitter made $5 billion in revenue and did not turn a profit. “This isn’t complicated,” says Mike Roberts, a professor at the Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania. “He owes a bunch of money, and he’s gotta raise money somewhere, somehow. What I wonder is about the ability of Twitter to pay this debt.”

So Musk has to figure out how to make money while people scream at him and impersonate him. Fun job!

Now, one way to free up cash is to fire a lot of people. The problem with doing that, though, is that you lose a bunch of the engineers who could build cool shit to make Twitter more attractive. This is maybe not a major problem, as all tech companies are cutting people loose right now, so Musk can hire new talent on the cheap if he has to.

It does get worse

But this does not solve a bigger problem, which is revenue. Last year, 89 percent of Twitter’s revenue — about $4.5 billion — came from advertising. The rest of the company’s income came from other streams, such as data licensing.

Let’s focus on the advertising problem for a minute. A lot of brands have paused their spending, and one ad exec who was on a call with Musk called his behavior “petulant and thoughtless.” This is an immediate problem because the fourth quarter is the most important one for any business that relies on advertising — including this here website. So a lot of major advertisers are pulling out of Twitter during a crucial period for the company to make money, something Musk himself has acknowledged. “Twitter has had a massive drop in revenue,” he tweeted.

It does get worse, and this part isn’t Musk’s fault. When the economy slows down, companies spend less money on advertising. So even if Musk weren’t doing wild stuff to alienate advertisers, such as tweeting conspiracy theories about Paul Pelosi, Twitter might have been in trouble anyway. But Musk has essentially identified himself and his company as a loose canon, which means that anyone looking to trim advertising spend might be inclined to cut Twitter first.

Now, Twitter did set up Tips — a way to send cash to people you like — but it doesn’t take a cut of that money. It does take a cut of the revenue from Super Follows, a way to make your tweets a subscription service, but Twitter’s share is dwarfed by the fees taken by Apple for in-app purchases.

This is the internet, and there’s forum drama

So in terms of revenue, the action, at least right now, is mostly around Twitter Blue, a premium-tier version of Twitter that lets users, among other things, edit their tweets. Musk raised the price of that product to $8, which may not be enough to cover its costs. Let’s do some back-of-the-envelope math, shall we? A year of Twitter blue is $96, which I am going to round to $100 for the purposes of simpler math. If 10 million people sign up for a year, that’s $1 billion in revenue right there. Easy, right?

Well, no, because this is the internet, and there’s forum drama. Blue users get a blue check mark, which looks exactly like the check mark verified users get — but Twitter Blue customers don’t have to verify their identity, which is how an account with a blue check mark and the display name “Nintendo of America” managed to put up a tweet of Mario flipping the bird. To an unwary user, that might look sufficiently like the actual Nintendo account to do brand damage.

But Musk doesn’t mind. When our own Tom Warren took a screenshot of the tweet, a user replied, “The beauty of this is each account that gets verified paid $8. Twitter keeps the money and suspends the account. It’s genius and I hope more folks do this. It’s free money for Twitter.” Musk himself replied to that user with a bullseye emoji, a smiley face wearing sunglasses, and a bag of money emoji.

I don’t think a lot of advertisers would want to come back to someone with that attitude toward impersonation, even without an economic downturn. The open question to me is whether users want to stay in that environment — one that’s just gotten a new layer of hoaxing and scammers. Billionaire Mark Cuban has already complained that the influx of new checkmarked users has made his mentions miserable. Cuban’s thoughts are one reason people stay on the platform — drive him off, and Twitter is less valuable.

You can see how that turns into a death spiral pretty quickly

Incidentally, Twitter is under a consent decree with the federal government requiring full documentation, in writing, of any foreseeable risks of “any product or service affecting commerce.” The changes to Twitter Blue rolled out less than two weeks after Musk bought Twitter. Do you think there’s full documentation about its risks? Sounds like Twitter’s lawyers are worried!

And that’s before we get to Musk’s paywall ambitions. Essentially, he’s told advertisers he wants to de-rank people using Twitter’s free product and make users pay for reach. Your average person won’t pay for reach, but people shilling newsletters, crypto scams, and other annoyances will. That might get Musk the revenue he wants, but it also degrades the site and potentially means fewer users stick around, making it less valuable for marketers, making them less likely to pay their $8… You can see how that turns into a death spiral pretty quickly.

But I don’t know that he’ll stick to that plan because he’s not especially known for sticking to plans. What I do know is that Musk has a lot of money, and he can give himself some runway to turn Twitter around by simply paying Twitter’s debt himself. So when Musk offloaded $3.9 billion of Tesla shares this week, I figure he was putting aside some cash for Twitter’s loans.

There’s a plausible world in which Musk just continues to offload Tesla shares to fund his Twitter experiments. (This is maybe not a great outcome for Tesla shareholders.) After all, he doesn’t have to keep advertisers happy, and as long as he’s paying interest, no one particularly cares where the money comes from. As long as he’s got the billions to pay off Twitter’s loans and whatever else, he’s got runway to remake the app into what he wants it to be — whatever that is.

Musk owns the hellsite and has been giving its rather hostile user base the tools for effectively trolling him out of billions of dollars

Let’s talk about the loans for a hot minute. The Twitter debt is currently held by the banks that helped facilitate this deal — unusual since, generally, they try to find buyers for the debt. But Musk’s lawsuit and delayed closing made that harder, and they’re stuck with the loans on their balance sheets. When they got into this situation, interest rates were lower. By the time the deal closed, though, the appetite for debt had changed, says Anant Sundaram, a professor at Dartmouth’s Tuck School of Business.

And it’s risky debt to boot, B1 rated, which is “on the lower end of the junk rating spectrum,” says Wharton’s Roberts. “Investor appetite for this debt clearly isn’t as large as it was four months ago.” And when Moody’s rated Twitter’s debt, it cited Twitter’s governance — i.e., Elon Musk — as a major driver of risk.

So for the banks, offloading Twitter’s debt now means taking an immediate loss. Banks may choose to hang on to the debt for a while to see whether the market conditions change. But if Twitter is obviously shitting the bed, unloading that debt gets even harder. Now, Musk is the richest guy in the world, so banks might be willing to negotiate terms with him about debt repayment. But I do wonder how long they want to hold these loans and who might buy them. If banks can’t place the debt, that probably does make it difficult for any other leveraged buy-outs in tech to get done.

“I sometimes get the feeling that people underestimate him, and maybe some of it is deserved because he always seems to live on the financial edge with every business he gets involved in,” says Sundaram. “But I’m willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.” Sundaram notes that none of us know what Musk’s financial model for Twitter is; perhaps he factored in losing a third or more of his users. Moderation problems that make Twitter a ghost town, like Truth Social or Parler, are the worst-case scenario, Sundaram says. “Then he’s finished.”"
5a3efe78-61dc-4930-8d97-178c342d1a55,"Yet, Musk has said his goal for Twitter is actually to “empower the voice of the people” and to become “by far the most accurate source of information in the world”. Let’s take these claims at face value. Do his actions further them? Can a company dominated by coders really fulfil those goals in places such as India, if it employs just a dozen people locally?

Musk’s idea that unmoderated, unmediated speech on a values-free platform will lead to democratisation and empowerment simply doesn’t hold true in the countries where most Twitter users live.

Half of the company’s ad revenue comes from the United States but more than 80 per cent of its users live elsewhere – most of them in countries that don’t have the constitutional and legal protections for speech that Americans such as Musk take for granted.

Hard content choices

Platforms that want to operate in such countries need to be able to make hard choices over content. Traditionally, Twitter has said that to create an attractive and accessible space for its users, it will follow government and court orders in the countries where it operates. But it also takes action beyond what is strictly required by law, removing tweets and suspending accounts that violate its own internal rules on hate speech and disinformation.

Importantly, the company also occasionally says it’s unable to obey official dictates. Last year, Twitter got into a tussle with the Indian government when it refused to block some accounts bureaucrats had ordered it to shut down.

At the time, the company insisted “we do not believe that the actions we have been directed to take are consistent with Indian law, and, in keeping with our principles of defending protected speech and freedom of expression, we have not taken any action on accounts that consist of news media entities, journalists, activists and politicians”.

In other words, to “empower the voice of the people” in most countries around the world, you sometimes have to do more than what is strictly required by law, and sometimes you have to do less. Promoting free speech in the US is relatively simple, given that the First Amendment is on your side. Elsewhere in the world, it requires teams of content specialists, government relations people and lawyers.

The charitable way of looking at this is that Musk – whose online bio currently reads “Twitter Complaint Hotline Operator” – is so naive that he genuinely thinks he can solve a lot of these problems himself. It’s been reported, for example, that he was “personally moderating” tweets about the closely fought Brazilian election last week. (There are 20 million Twitter users in Brazil.)

Even if you think that Musk is Superman, or possibly Tony Stark, the evidence is already piling up that this task might be a little beyond one man. You can’t easily apply political intuitions that have been formed in a very specific US discourse to other, complicated countries such as Brazil.

Unsurprisingly, this approach created trouble for Musk within a week, when he promised to “look into” the suspension of some right-wing accounts in Brazil. The assurance was given, publicly and on Twitter, to a not-at-all-suspended television personality with a million followers, who also happens to be the grandson of Brazil’s last military dictator.

Musk might think the Twitter he bought crimped free speech. But governments from Turkey to Nigeria to India disagree. They worry that Twitter brings American notions of what constitutes free expression into their societies, reducing their ability to police speech. They would celebrate a platform with less moderation and less capacity to push back against state power. The chances are that they are right and Musk is wrong about what it takes to defend free speech.

FTX, a major cryptocurrency exchange, is on the brink of collapse this week amid liquidity concerns and allegations of misused funds, followed by a large volume of withdrawals from rattled investors. The value of FTX’s native token, FTT, plummeted, taking other coins with it, including Ethereum and Bitcoin, which reached a two-year low as of Wednesday afternoon.

The impact of FTX’s crash could have wide-reaching implications throughout the crypto market because cryptocurrencies and exchanges with exposure to FTT or FTX could face plummeting prices and financial troubles.

Here’s what this week’s events mean for major exchanges, U.S. investors and future crypto regulations.

What happened to FTX?

These are the key points:

FTX is a cryptocurrency exchange founded by CEO Sam Bankman-Fried in 2019. The exchange issues its own token, FTT, and was the fourth-largest crypto exchange by volume as of Tuesday.

founded by CEO Sam Bankman-Fried in 2019. The exchange issues its own token, FTT, and was the fourth-largest crypto exchange by volume as of Tuesday. Bankman-Fried also founded a crypto trading firm called Alameda Research; CoinDesk reported on Alameda’s troubled balance sheet Nov. 2. Its largest assets, according to the report, are billions of dollars worth of FTT.

CoinDesk reported on Alameda’s troubled balance sheet Nov. 2. Its largest assets, according to the report, are billions of dollars worth of FTT. Changpeng Zhao, CEO of rival exchange Binance, tweeted Sunday that he was planning to sell off Binance’s stockpile of FTT because of “recent revelations that have came to light,” referring to the Nov. 2 CoinDesk report of FTX and Alameda’s blurred funds. He compared FTX’s situation to the crash of TerraUSD and LUNA this year that tanked the crypto market and cost investors billions of dollars. But typically, such moves aren’t announced publicly.

He compared FTX’s situation to the crash of TerraUSD and LUNA this year that tanked the crypto market and cost investors billions of dollars. But typically, such moves aren’t announced publicly. Zhao’s announcement led to a rapid decline in FTT’s value over the next day as suspicion grew that FTX didn’t have the liquidity needed to back transactions and stay afloat. The value of other coins — including BTC and ETH — declined as well, with Bitcoin dropping to a two-year low. Bankman-Fried said in a tweet Thursday that the platform saw $5 billion in withdrawals Sunday.

Bankman-Fried said in a tweet Thursday that the platform saw $5 billion in withdrawals Sunday. Zhao and Bankman-Fried struck a deal for Binance to acquire the non-U.S. branch of FTX. The exchange CEOs signed a nonbinding letter of intent Tuesday, essentially promising to bail out the failing exchange to prevent a larger market crash.

The exchange CEOs signed a nonbinding letter of intent Tuesday, essentially promising to bail out the failing exchange to prevent a larger market crash. Binance withdrew from the deal. Within a day, Zhao posted on Twitter that Binance had completed its “corporate due diligence” and said it would not be acquiring FTX. Zhao tweeted that the news reports of “mishandled customer funds” and “alleged U.S. agency investigations” contributed to his decision. Bankman-Fried appeared to reference Zhao’s influence on FTX’s fall in a cryptic post on Twitter where he said, “Well played; you won.”

Bankman-Fried appeared to reference Zhao’s influence on FTX’s fall in a cryptic post on Twitter where he said, “Well played; you won.” On Tuesday, FTX halted all non-fiat customer withdrawals. On Twitter, Bankman-Fried posted a string of apologies explaining FTX’s liquidity issues and promising more transparency. He emphasized that the U.S. branch of FTX was not affected by this crisis, but as of Thursday, FTX.US said on its website that trading might be halted “in a few days.”

He emphasized that the U.S. branch of FTX was not affected by this crisis, but as of Thursday, FTX.US said on its website that trading might be halted “in a few days.” Bankman-Fried told an investor that Alameda owes FTX about $10 billion, which FTX loaned to Alameda using customer deposits, according to a recent report by The Wall Street Journal. But before making the loan, FTX had just $16 billion in assets, according to the report, meaning it lent out more than half of its assets.

What does this mean for U.S. customers?

FTX’s Bankman-Fried and Binance’s Zhao emphasized that the liquidity issues concerned FTX International, not FTX.US, the American branch of the exchange, which is subject to more regulation.

However, on Thursday, FTX.US posted a warning on its website for users on the log-in screen, noting that trading “may be halted on FTX US in the next few days.” The message told users to close any positions they wanted to and that withdrawals would remain open.

Bankman-Fried tweeted Thursday that the FTX.US exchange is “100% liquid,” meaning users could fully withdraw all of their invested funds. However, Bloomberg reported that he told FTX.com investors Wednesday that without a bailout, the company would need to file for bankruptcy. It’s unclear if this would include FTX.US.

What does this mean for the U.S. crypto market?

FTX’s troubles have had a profound effect on the U.S. crypto market:

Bitcoin’s price dipped below $16,000 on Wednesday.

Ethereum dipped below $1,100 on Wednesday.

Solana dipped below $13 on Wednesday after CoinDesk’s report that Alameda held a large amount of it.

Tether briefly depegged from the U.S. dollar, dropping by 3% on Thursday.

Cryptocurrency is a relatively risky investment and should be treated accordingly. High-risk investments should make up a small part of your overall portfolio, and diversifying the range of cryptocurrencies you buy can help minimize risk.

I’m worried about keeping my crypto with an exchange. What should I do?

Consider moving your digital assets to a separate crypto wallet. Most exchanges allow you to transfer assets to these wallets, which can be online (on a separate platform) or offline (on a thumb drive with added security features).

With the current economic forecast uneven, gold may be worth exploring. Wolfgang Filser/EyeEm

Inflation slightly eased in October but prices jumped more than 7% compared to the same time in 2021. Core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy costs, rose 6.3%.

Many Americans are struggling to navigate an unpredictable stock market, often dropping and rising based on the news cycle (like the midterm elections and U.S. inflation data). Stock market losses have also wiped out trillions of retirement savings so far this year. And some experts still believe a recession is looming, which could cause even steeper declines.

So, it's no surprise that investors are looking for every potential advantage they can gain in this economic environment. One unique but potentially beneficial route is gold. Gold can be purchased in bulk or added to your IRA.

You should begin by speaking with a gold expert now. They can help you get started with a free wealth protection kit.

How gold can help investors in an uneven economy

With the current economic forecast uneven, gold may be worth exploring. Here are two major ways it can help investors now.

As a hedge against inflation

This may be the most timely benefit of buying gold. With inflation remaining stubborn, now is a good time to invest in something that can keep - and potentially improve - its value.

""A rise in inflation or inflationary expectations increases investors' interest in purchasing gold and, therefore, drives up its price; in contrast, disinflation or a drop in inflationary expectations does the opposite,"" the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago noted.

""Over time, the value of gold tends to rise as the purchasing power of fiat currencies falls,"" Harry Turner, the founder of The Sovereign Investor, an investment education website, recently explained to CBS News.

""This is because, unlike paper money or other types of investments, gold is a physical asset that can be stored and traded. As long as people continue to see it as a valuable commodity, the price of gold is likely to remain a good hedge against inflation.""

If the interest you're earning from your other investments hasn't been much lately, then explore your gold options to see how you can start making up the difference. It's better to act now before the value rises and the cost of buying gold becomes prohibitive.

As a way to diversify your portfolio

The old way of investing hasn't been particularly successful as of late. Accordingly, it may be time to spread your investments a bit to better optimize your chances of success.

That doesn't mean you need to radically change your investments, though. Even 5% in gold can potentially help.

Edward Karr, the founder of U.S. Gold Corp., recently told CBS News that a minor amount dedicated to gold mining equities or physical gold could potentially help ""reduce an overall portfolio's risk and potentially increase the long-term returns.""

Instead of tying up all of your money in stocks and bonds, spreading it among different investment types could better help you manage your risk. By putting some money into gold - in addition to your other investments - you'll increase the likelihood of having your money grow. Use the table below to explore your options.

The bottom line

Gold presents a unique opportunity for investors looking for relief during tough economic conditions. It may not be the best option for everyone but it's certainly worth exploring, particularly when the return on traditional investments has been subpar.

Speak with an expert now to see if gold is right for you."
b2a87411-9a0b-4611-9e97-259cfe162fe0,"Japan has been selling some of its US Treasury holdings to intervene in currency markets to prop up the yen. China has also reduced its US dollar holdings. It is possible that the developing economies most affected by dollar strength might also be sellers of dollar-denominated assets. There is, therefore, a strong inverse correlation between gold and the US dollar and US interest rates. Gold produces no income, so there is an opportunity cost in holding it or, if it is financed, a real and increasing cost of funding if rates are rising. The surge in the US dollar also increases the cost of buying bullion in other currencies because, again, gold is priced in US dollars. Inflation relief, crypto carnage The price has rebounded this month because markets have become convinced that the Fed has, if not beaten inflation, started to gain control of it. Last week’s US inflation data appears to show that inflation, while still uncomfortably high, has peaked.

The release of the data last week saw US bond yields fall back and the US dollar weaken significantly and, not surprisingly, the gold price kick up about 4 per cent. The carnage in the market for crypto assets may also have been an influence – gold and cryptos are usually seen as the prime alternatives to equities and bonds. While the gold price was languishing through much of this year it wasn’t for a dearth of buyers. In the nine months to September, 1181 tonnes of gold was bought, about 28 per cent more than for the same period last year. Central banks bought 399 tonnes in the September quarter, lifting their purchases in the first nine months of this year to 673 tonnes. According to the World Gold Council, that was more than any full year since 1967. The previous record was 241 tonnes bought by central banks in the same quarter of 2018. Maybe it was the appeal of the depressed price that caused central banks with US dollar reserves to wade in, but the surge in central bank buying might also have something to do with the war in Ukraine and the financial sanctions the US and Europeans imposed on Russia at the onset of the conflict.

In response to the invasion, the West froze more than half Russia’s $US640 billion ($946 billion) of gold and foreign exchange reserves held offshore in an unprecedented move against a member of the G20. That triggered alarm bells elsewhere. While Russia itself has played down speculation that it might have used some of the windfall gains it has experienced from the post-invasion surge in oil prices to buy gold, it wouldn’t be in the least surprising if others saw gold as a way to reduce their potential exposure to similar actions in the future. Obvious buyers China and Russia don’t disclose their gold purchases, but China is an obvious potential buyer, given that it is already subject to some sanctions (over the imposition of national security laws in Hong Kong and China’s treatment of the Uighurs) that use the US dominance of global finance as leverage. Trade data suggests China has been a big buyer. Others who did report their purchases, and which have been buying, are Turkey, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and India, but their buying only accounts for about a quarter of the September quarter splurge. Apart from China, and perhaps Russia, speculation about other potential buyers centres on the Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia.

In theory, the near-record level of buying should have forced the price up earlier in the year, but it was offset by big outflows of funds from the exchange-traded funds (ETFs), hedge funds and other private financial buyers, with modest inflows and more generally net outflows of funds into the ETFs this year in response to the surge in what was, until the most recent data, a continuing escalation of inflation rates in most key economies. Loading If the Fed has broken the back of US inflation, then - even though it is certain there will be another 50 basis point rise in the federal funds rate and possibly one or two more increases next year - the outlook for the gold price would have stabilised and appear more positive. That would be good news for gold producers, which would have been getting nervous a few weeks ago as the price fell towards their “all-in” production costs and their own share prices slumped. Gold’s status as a haven in tumultuous and inflationary times has, if it’s just price that’s the barometer, taken a beating in what has been a very volatile year for all financial assets."

There are some consistent benefits to buying gold, particularly during times of inflation. Getty Images/iStockphoto

When it comes to sound financial planning, investors need to make a series of calculations. The stock market, inflation, interest rates and both national and international politics are all influencing factors. Investments should be adjusted accordingly.

During a time of inflation and uneven market performance, investors are (or should be) reviewing their finances even more closely than usual. Part of that analysis should include alternative opportunities that may not have been considered in a stronger market.

In this environment, some people may be turning to gold. Whether purchased in bulk or via an IRA, gold can potentially provide unique financial support for investors. But the timing behind any purchase is important, as is the amount purchased.

If you're considering gold now then consider speaking to a professional. They can answer any questions you have and help you get started with a free wealth protection kit.

Is gold a good investment?

There is no standard answer to this question. Instead, the benefits of gold are relative to the investor's personal circumstances and long-term goals. If you fall in one (or more) of the below categories then you may want to pursue gold now.

Investors looking for help with inflation

Most Americans are looking for relief from the pain inflicted by decades-high inflation. Gold can potentially help.

""Over time, the value of gold tends to rise as the purchasing power of fiat currencies falls,"" Harry Turner, the founder of The Sovereign Investor, an investment education website, recently explained to CBS News.

""This is because, unlike paper money or other types of investments, gold is a physical asset that can be stored and traded. As long as people continue to see it as a valuable commodity, the price of gold is likely to remain a good hedge against inflation.""

""Inflation occurs when the value of the dollar or another currency declines, usually because governments print too much money,"" a Money.com report noted. ""By contrast, gold has been seen as valuable for thousands of years, and its supply is fixed by miners' ability to pull it from the ground.""

For further context, look at the 1970s. The decade was hit hard by inflation with an average interest rate of 5.84% in 1970, according to NASDAQ data. That rocketed to 13.58% by 1980. But during the same time frame, the value of gold rose from $35 per share to $850 per share, a recent report notes.

If you think you could benefit from buying gold in an inflationary market, then speak to a professional now to get started.

Investors who want to diversify their portfolio

If you're an investor who falls into the above category then you probably fall into this one, too. Traditional investments in 2022 have been uneven or down so far this year. So it probably makes sense to spread out the risk and put (some) money into other investments.

Edward Karr, the founder of U.S. Gold Corp., recently told CBS News that a minor amount dedicated to gold mining equities or physical gold could potentially help ""reduce an overall portfolio's risk and potentially increase the long-term returns.""

Instead of tying up all of your money in stocks and bonds, spreading it among different investment types could better help you manage your risk. By putting some money into gold - in addition to your other investments - you can increase the likelihood of having your money grow. Use the table below to explore your options.

Investors looking for a physical asset

In an environment where volatility is king, some investors may fall back on tried and true methods. Physical gold could be one alternative. Stocks, bonds, IRAs and even a 401(k) can be tied up with banks and lenders and be subject to fees and withdrawal considerations. They also may just be difficult to access when needed.

But physical gold, whether bought in bars, coins or some other form, is easy to transport, store and if needed, sell. If you're an investor who prefers cash then physical gold may be for you, too.

The bottom line

Investing in gold is beneficial for multiple reasons, particularly when the economy is uneven and the economic forecast is unknown. If you think you could benefit from investing in gold then reach out to an expert today to get started."

As a commodity, gold has had what one analyst this summer called “a manic roller coaster ride.” It soared to an all-time high in the summer of 2020 as covid cases worldwide surged, breaching $2,000 per ounce. Since then it has slumped sharply, though prices recently spiked again to above $1,700 amid turmoil in the crypto world and a slide in the dollar.

The precious metal has traditionally been seen as a haven in times of volatility, uncertainty, and distress—and the world has certainly imbibed a head-spinning cocktail of all three in the past two years between the ongoing pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the subsequent global energy crisis.

But the US Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate hikes, as it battles inflation, have fueled a relentless rise in the dollar, which in turn has taken some wind out of gold’s sails. In part, that’s because yields on US 10-year Treasury bonds—which compete with gold as a safe haven investment—are at their highest since 2008.

“All these trillions of dollars that we’ve printed over the last couple years… I think that money does come back to haunt us,” said Michael Townsend, a director at Infinity Stone Ventures, a Canadian firm that mines critical metals including gold. “I think inflation is here to stay…so gold is here to stay.”

Let’s keep panning.

Brief history



The birth, death, and reincarnation of the gold standard?

Advertisement

In July 1944, 44 countries met in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, to hash out a blueprint for the future of the post-World War II international monetary system. That plan finally took effect more than a dozen years later, in 1958. Under the Bretton Woods system, countries pegged their currencies to the dollar, which in turn was fixed to gold at $35 per ounce.

“In effect, the entire Western financial system was pegged to gold, via the dollar,” as Bloomberg’s John Authers describes it. And with the US holding about three-quarters of global gold reserves, the system seemed secure.

But a gold-dollar crisis was brewing. Gold was flowing out of the US, a result of America’s declining share of world output as European and Japanese exports became more competitive, but also due to US military spending and foreign aid. Then, in 1965, came the Great Inflation in the US, threatening a run on US gold reserves. To stave off that risk, then-president Richard Nixon scrapped the convertibility of dollars to gold in 1971.

Could the gold standard make a comeback? That question has periodically resurfaced in public policy discourse, though most economists dismiss that possibility as a fool’s errand.

More recently, however, the global energy and food price crisis caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has rekindled interest in—and fierce debate over—a new kind of Bretton Woods system, with commodity- or commodities-backed currencies. Think metals and grains and energy.

Central banks worldwide are snapping up gold at a pace that hasn’t been seen since 1967, when the dollar was still backed by the precious metal. An inflation-fueled flight to safe assets has driven much of the increased demand.

Would you prefer to have a golden parachute, golden handshake, or a pair of golden handcuffs?

Brian Klaas, a professor of global politics at University College London, argues that golden handcuffs—the offer of a cushy life in exile—can be a solution for coaxing autocrats out of power (though, he caveats, this option shouldn’t be made available for the worst of the worst, including Vladimir Putin).

Several dictators have readily accepted the offer of golden handcuffs, according to Klaas.

In 1994, US officials reportedly offered Raoul Cédras, the military dictator of Haiti, an exit package of a million dollars in return for leaving power without a fight.

And in 2016, a bloc of west African countries told the Gambian dictator Yahya Jammeh, who refused to concede an electoral loss, that he could either face invasion or leave for exile. Jammeh chose the latter, fleeing the country—but not before allegedly plundering millions of dollars from state coffers.

Klaas further explains why such golden handcuffs could be a realistic option for reducing the number of autocrats worldwide:

“Some might argue that the golden-handcuffs option would create moral hazard, encouraging dictators to believe that they will never face justice for their crimes,” Klaas writes. “But most dictators escape justice anyway, dying of old age, or at the hand of a rival or an angry mob. A policy of safe passage would more likely increase transitions of dictators who otherwise would have fought to the bitter end to stay in power, rather than decrease the amount of justice served.”

Tesla stock has been hit by a wider tech sell-off and concerns over Musk's Twitter takeover.

Berkshire has benefited from the rush to haven assets, and profited from higher interest rates.

Elon Musk's Tesla has tumbled below Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway in market value, as investors continue to swap out riskier stocks for safer options, and worry Musk's Twitter takeover could be a costly distraction.

Tesla's market capitalization slumped below $600 billion in early trading on Wednesday, well short of Berkshire's $645 billion market value. Buffett's company has officially reclaimed its spot as the fifth-largest company in the S&P 500 index.

That's a striking reversal, given shares of Musk's electric-vehicle maker soared from a split-adjusted $30 at the start of 2020 to north of $400 last November, lifting the company's market cap from under $100 billion to over $1.2 trillion at its peak.

According to latest figures, Tesla stock has plunged by 53% this year, wiping roughly $600 billion from the automaker's market cap. Meanwhile, Berkshire shares have slid just 3%, leaving the conglomerate's market cap virtually intact. The contrast in their fortunes reflects how differently investors perceive the risk of holding each of their stocks.

Musk's company has been hammered by a wider exodus from technology stocks in the face of stubborn inflation, rising interest rates, and a looming recession.

Fast-growing businesses promise to earn the bulk of their profits in the future, but those dollars become less appealing when prices are rising, and savings accounts and bonds are offering larger, guaranteed returns.

Moreover, tech companies' lofty valuations, lack of steady cash flows, and more speculative investments often make them more vulnerable to economic downturns.

Also, Musk recently closed his $44 billion buyout of Twitter, and is now in the process of revamping the social-media platform, laying off roughly half its workforce, and trying to stop it from hemorrhaging cash. He just sold about $4 billion of Tesla stock, likely to service the loans he took out to finance his takeover.

Close followers of Tesla fear Musk has become less focused on the automaker, and might sell more shares, which could temper the company's prospects and drag down its stock price.

Berkshire stock has fared better this year as investors consider it a safe place to keep their money. Buffett's company actually benefited from higher interest rates and a stronger dollar last quarter, reflecting its mountain of cash and bonds, and its largely domestic focus.

Buffett is also known for prizing stocks and businesses with strong brands that dominate their markets, such as Kraft Heinz and Coca-Cola, as they're able to raise prices to offset inflation. Moreover, Berkshire is hugely diversified, so a housing-market crash or a plunge in retail sales is unlikely to eviscerate its earnings.

Notably, Berkshire has poured upwards of $25 billion into Chevron and Occidental Petroleum this year, and now counts the two oil-and-gas companies among the top holdings in its stock portfolio.

Those bets have soared in value this year, as Russia's war with Ukraine continues to roil energy markets and drive up prices, which has helped to offset weakness in other parts of Berkshire's business.

Tesla could find another gear and zoom past Berkshire in market value, but for now at least, Buffett has the bragging rights over Musk once again.

Here's a chart comparing Tesla and Berkshire's market caps in recent years:"
b61ec28f-52d1-46dd-8068-f14397927d14,"San Francisco | Elon Musk disclosed he had dumped another $US3.95 billion ($6 billion) worth of his Tesla shares on Tuesday (Wednesday AEDT), taking his total sales to nearly $US20 billion since he launched his $US44 billion takeover bid for Twitter this year.

The purpose of the latest sales, which took place between Friday and Tuesday, according to a regulatory filing, was not disclosed. But concerns Mr Musk would need to sell a large block of Tesla stock to finance his Twitter purchase have hung over the electric carmaker’s share price for much of this year.

Elon Musk’s advisers continued to seek other investors, though it is unclear how much additional equity he was able to attract. Washington Post

Tesla shares have fallen 52 per cent this year, and are down 42 per cent since the billionaire announced his offer for the social media site in April.

The Tesla chief executive appeared to claim he had sufficient funds to complete the Twitter deal after an initial sale of $US8.5 billion worth of the carmaker’s stock in April. At the time, he wrote on Twitter: “No further TSLA sales planned after today.”

However, he went on to sell another $US6.9 billion of Tesla shares in August and linked the second sale directly to the need to pay for the platform."
7830b303-7dc3-476d-8f97-a606c636ad09,"Twitter users have complained a lot about Elon Musk’s early moves after taking control of the social network, but their complaints seem tiny compared with what Tesla Inc. investors have had to suffer.

As the U.S. focused on election returns Tuesday evening, Tesla TSLA, +7.67% Chief Executive Musk tried to slip through disclosure of his long-awaited stock sales, revealing that he had sold nearly $4 billion of Tesla stock in the previous three trading sessions. Musk did not publicly address the stock sales nor his intentions to sell more within 24 hours of the disclosure, even while tweeting roughly 20 times in that period.

[MarketWatch asked him on Twitter to address the sales twice, and did not receive a reply; Tesla disbanded its media-relations department years ago.]

The sales fueled a further downturn in shares of the electric-vehicle maker on Wednesday, when the stock fell 7.2% to $177.59, its lowest closing price since November 2020. Tesla is currently down 49.6% on the year, which would be far and away the worst year yet for the stock — the previous record annual decline was 2016, when it fell 11%.

The problems for Tesla investors go far beyond Musk selling its stock so that he could overpay for a company with limited growth prospects and a host of other problems, but the poor optics certainly start there.

“He sold caviar to buy a $2 slice of pizza,” said Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst.

Ives was one of several on Wall Street to predict Musk would need to sell more shares to either close a gap in his financing of the $44 billion deal to buy the social-media company, or provide additional operating funds. In a telephone conversation Wednesday, he said the Twitter move is “a nightmare that just won’t end for Tesla investors.”

One reason it isn’t ending is that Musk’s need for cash in relation to Twitter is not done with the recent sales, portending more in the future. Musk said in a tweet late last week that Twitter had a “massive drop in revenue” due to activists pressuring advertisers to pull their ads, and he will have to continue paying the employees he did not lay off while servicing a debt load that analysts have estimated will cost him $1 billion a year, much more than Twitter has cleared in profit in the past two years. Twitter reported a net loss of $221 million in 2021, and a net loss of $1.13 billion for 2020.

“The first two weeks of ownership have been a ‘Friday the 13th‘ horror show,” Ives said, adding that the verification plan and mass layoffs of 50% of employees — and then trying to rehire some of the engineers, developers and cybersecurity experts — was “really stupid.” And, according to CNBC, Musk has also pulled more than 50 Tesla engineers, many from the Autopilot team, to work at Twitter.

“But it’s consistent with how this thing has been handled,” Ives said, adding that Musk is “way over his skis” with the Twitter acquisition.

Amid all the chaos of his first two weeks running Twitter, how much time has Musk had to run his other companies? Musk was already splitting his Tesla time with SpaceX, The Boring Company, Neuralink and many other endeavors, and now he has taken on the gargantuan task of turning a social-media company that has never been highly profitable, nor valuable, into something worth the $44 billion he paid.

The effort, Ives said, has “tarnished his brand,” which in turn has a big risk of hurting Tesla. Many investors have bought into the Tesla story because they believe Musk is a genius and they back his vision of electrifying the automotive industry. Twitter does not meld into that vision, except as a platform to spout his opinions, vitriol and promote more wacky concepts.

Since Musk began his quest to buy the company, he has endured more criticism than ever before, with even some fans starting to throw shade or question his decisions. Investor Gary Black, managing partner of the Future Fund LLC, for example, pointed out that Tesla’s top engineers should not be running Twitter, where the news was getting worse.

Tesla is not a company that can just run itself at this point. Musk has claimed he did not want to be chief executive but that there was no one else to take over the car company, which is why he has served as CEO for years. It’s not clear, though, how much effort he actually has made at trying to recruit someone. Now, as Tesla faces its usual multitude of issues, he is off spending his time trying to turn Twitter into a payments company, or maybe a subscription company, or maybe an “everything app,” or whatever he comes up with tomorrow.

“Musk needs to look in the mirror and end this constant merry-go-round of Twitter overhang on the Tesla story, with his focus back on the golden child Tesla, which needs his time more than ever given the soft macro, production/delivery issues in China, and EV competition increasing from all corners of the globe,” Ives wrote in a note Wednesday, in which he reiterated an outperform rating on Tesla stock.

On Thursday, after this column was originally published, Ives took Tesla off Wedbush’s Best New Ideas list. He wrote that the near-term view of the stock “is increasingly becoming more challenged,” citing the “ongoing Twitter train wreck disaster.”

For Twitter to reach anywhere close to the valuation Musk paid for it, it’s going to need a ton of attention from a focused leader, but how can Musk be that leader and give Tesla the attention it deserves? The answer is he cannot, and is very likely to give the attention that Tesla needs to Twitter instead after committing $44 billion (not all of it his) to that endeavor. Tesla investors will be left staring at the sea of red that this year has wrought, and wondering if its leader is about to sell more shares to fund his other effort."
53031892-d8cd-4659-8c0f-500098387e34,"Tesla shares dropped more than 7% on Wednesday to close at $177.59, their lowest since November 2020, after CEO Elon Musk disclosed the sale of close to $4 billion worth of stock in the electric car company.

The stock is down 50% year-to-date. As of Tuesday's close, it was the 465th worst performer this year in the S&P 500.

Musk apparently sold the latest batch of Tesla shares at least in part to finance his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter, which closed in late October. His sales were revealed through financial filings with the SEC on Tuesday night, published as votes from the U.S. mid-term elections were being tallied.

According to an analysis by Ben Silverman, Director of Research for VerityData, Musk's latest Tesla stock sales were very well-timed. Silverman tracks insider sales by company executives.

Tesla closed at $215.31 on Nov. 3, the day before his first sale in this batch, and closed at $191.30 on Nov. 8, the day of his most recent disclosed sale. Shares declined about 11% over those three trading days.

VerityData's InsiderScore notes that Musk had 267.6 million shares of Tesla pledged as collateral for personal indebtedness as of Mar. 31. He holds about 19.7% of Tesla's outstanding shares following the latest sale of about 19.5 million shares, a decline from about 22.4% ownership at the end of 2020.

Musk still owns 445.6 million Tesla shares and holds exercisable options for 177.3 million more Tesla shares at $23.34, as well as some smaller tranches of options.

Musk sold $8.5 billion worth of Tesla shares at $294.36 per share in April and $6.9 billion worth of his stock at $289.79 per share. Late last year, Musk sold $6.6 billion worth of Tesla shares at $357.23.

""Regardless of his reasoning for selling TSLA shares right now, it's hard to ignore the expert timing of his previous sales,"" InsiderScore wrote. ""In other words, Musk is no dummy, so following his lead may not be a bad idea.""

Musk has pulled dozens of Tesla employees, mostly Autopilot engineers, to Twitter to help him with code review and other work. He hasn't made clear how he or these employees will divide their schedules and responsibility at the companies.

TWITTER UPDATES:Musk walks back Twitter layoffs, Kathy Griffin suspended

3,700

One of Musk's first moves after purchasing Twitter for $44 billion on Oct. 27 was to announce massive layoffs. Those cuts took place Friday with 3,700 out of about 7,500 employees being laid off.

Twitter wasn't the only tech company laying off workers this month. Meta, Snapchat and Netflix also laid off workers while Amazon imposed a hiring freeze.

$4 million per day

That's how much Musk said Twitter was losing as of Friday, a week after he purchased the company. He blamed the loss of revenue on ""activist groups pressuring advertisers"" over content moderation concerns.

Some advertisers have paused ad purchases on the platform, including General Motors, Pfizer, Volkswagen, and Jeep maker Stellantis NV, according to reports from the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg.

Musk held a ""Twitter spaces"" conversation Wednesday in order to speak to advertiser concerns which had more than 95,000 listeners about a half hour in.

“I don't think having hate speech next to an ad is great,"" Musk said. This came days after he threatened a “thermonuclear name & shame” campaign against any advertisers that leave the site.

Is Elon Musk selling Tesla stock?

Most of Musk's net worth is tied to Tesla stock, which as noted, has plunged in value this year.

He's also sold off about $36 billion in Tesla stock over the past year, according to Reuters, including 19.5 million shares valued at just under $4 billion between last Friday and Tuesday U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings show.

Tesla investors may fear Musk has become less focused on the automaker as he spends time on the Twitter deal, both Bloomberg and Market Insider reported.

They also may be anticipating him selling more shares to finance that purchase, which could drag down Tesla's stock price further.

32af7894-99c1-49b0-a760-b937f1008895,"Elon Musk's second week of Twitter ownership proves as chaotic as his first

Elon Musk's net worth has dropped to an estimated $195.6 billion, according to Forbes. Musk's net worth dropped on Tuesday, hitting its lowest point this year.

This is the second time since Oct. 1, 2021, that his net worth has dipped below $200 billion, except for a brief drop to $199 billion in May of this year, Forbes reports.

His net worth is still astronomical – and enough to solidify his spot as richest man in the world — but Musk's worth was once larger. In January, he had an estimated worth of $304.2 billion, Forbes says. At that time, his worth had increased about $32.6 billion as Tesla stock soared.

That was, of course, before Musk began his acquisition of Twitter in April. In August, he sold nearly 8 million Tesla shares – worth $7 billion – as a legal battle with Twitter loomed. Twitter sued Musk to enforce the rules of their acquisition agreement after Musk tried to back out. Musk then countersued, alleging the company committed fraud, breach of contract and violation of a securities law.

A judge paused the case in order to let the deal close, and last month, Musk officially acquired the company for $44 million.

The Twitter takeover was a tumultuous one. Musk recently sold another $4 billion in stock to close the gap on the deal – even though he said he was ""done selling Tesla stock,"" according to Wedbush analysts.

And this week, he sold another 19.5 million Tesla shares – worth $3.9 billion – over three days, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Forbes reports. He now has sold $19.3 billion in Tesla shares since April. That, combined with the dip in Tesla share price, contributed to the decrease in his net worth.

Musk not only lost credibility with investors over his acquisition of Twitter, but also drew ire for the changes he immediately set into motion at the social media company. Many feared his changes to content bans would allow hate speech on the platform. He also fired top executives and a large swath of employees. And, he introduced ""Twitter Blue"" – a subscription for a blue checkmark that will cost users $7.99 a month – as a way to increase revenue.

Musk's net worth is made up of his stock and ownership of the six companies he co-founded, including Tesla, SpaceX and the Boring Company. While he offloaded a ton of Tesla stock, he still owns $445.6 million in Tesla shares, excluding options, according to Forbes.

He also now owns an estimated 82% of Twitter, after taking the company private with additional help from a $12.5 billion loan from a group of big banks, including Morgan Stanley and Bank of America.

He is still ahead of the second richest people in the world, French billionaire Bernard Arnault and his family, who own fashion house LVMH. Their net worth is estimated to be $159.8 billion. Third richest is Indian billionaire Gautam Adani, who gets his $144.7 billion net worth from infrastructure and commodities.

Elon Musk's wealth has dropped back below $200 billion after Tesla's share price tumbled as the company's CEO bid for and bought Twitter.

His net worth was $197.4 billion at the closing bell Tuesday, a drop of $3.9 billion from the day before, according to Forbes' Real-Time Billionaires list.

Tesla shares fell 2.93% to close at $191.30 Tuesday, after the electric vehicle maker said it was recalling 40,000 vehicles over a power-steering flaw. Musk owns about 17% of the company, according to a recent filing.

""It's been another tough day at the office for Tesla after the electric car maker announced another recall,"" AJ Bell financial analyst Danni Hewson said.

""Shares have tumbled more than 40% since the start of the year, and investors might be getting pretty fed up with Elon Musk sticking his nose into just about everything, including the mid-terms,"" she added.

The uncertainty surrounding Musk's recent takeover of Twitter has also weighed on Tesla this year, analysts said. Its stock is down over 45%, year to date.

Musk sold 19.5 million of Tesla shares — worth around $3.95 billion— after he completed his buyout of Twitter, a Securities and Exchange Commission filing published Tuesday showed.

He last sold Tesla shares in August — nearly $7 billion worth — when he suggested he was raising cash in case he was forced to go through with his offer to buy Twitter.

Musk acquired an estimated 82% of Twitter on October 28, ending a six-month-long battle over a takeover that he tried to back out of.

Musk's fortune has plunged by over $74 billion since April, when he said he wanted to take the social media company private, according to Forbes.

He remains the world's richest man despite that loss of wealth, with a higher net worth than LVMH chief executive Bernard Arnault ($159 billion), Indian industrialist Gautam Adani ($145 billion), and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos ($114 billion), per Forbes.

f8b8d097-86e5-4505-91ed-0fde16010fcb,"Twitter’s new owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk sold nearly $4 billion worth of Tesla shares, according to regulatory filings.

Musk, who bought Twitter for $44 billion, sold 19.5 million shares of the electric car company from Nov. 4 to Nov. 8, according to Tuesday’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

He sold $7 billion of his Tesla stock in August as he worked to finance the Twitter purchase he was trying to get out of at the time. In all, Musk has sold more than $19 billion worth of Tesla stock since April, including those in Tuesday’s filings, likely to fund his share of the Twitter purchase.

The takeover of Twitter has not been smooth and the social media platform has seen the exodus of some big advertisers in recent weeks in including United Airlines, General Motors, REI, General Mills and Audi.

Musk acknowledged “a massive drop in revenue” at Twitter, which heavily relies on advertising to make money.

Musk had signaled that he was done selling Tesla shares and the revelation that those sales continue left some industry analysts exasperated.

“Our fear heading into the final days of the deal was that Musk was going to be forced to sell more Tesla stock to fund the disaster Twitter deal and ultimately those fears came true which speaks to some of the massive selling pressures on the stock of late,” wrote Daniel Ives at Wedbush. “For Musk who multiple times over the past year has said he is ‘done selling Tesla stock’ yet again loses more credibility with investors and his loyalists in a boy who cried wolf moment.”

Most of Musk’s wealth is tied up in shares of Tesla Inc. On Tuesday, his personal net worth dropped below $200 billion, according to Forbes, but he is still the world’s richest person.

Shares of Tesla Inc., down almost 50% this year, tumbled another 6% Wednesday.

Musk had lined up banks including Morgan Stanley to help finance the Twitter deal. His original share of the deal was about $15.5 billion, Ives estimated . But if equity investors dropped out, Musk would be on the hook to replace them or throw in more of his own money.

“The Twitter circus show has been an absolute debacle from all angles since Musk bought the platform for all the world to see: from the 50% layoffs and then bringing back some workers, to the head scratching verification roll-out to users which many are pushing back on, to the constant tweeting in this political firestorm backdrop, and now…..selling more TSLA stock,” Ives wrote. “When does it end?”

The stock market has been weak. And the value of Bitcoin is also well down from its highs when measured against other currencies such as the dollar and the pound. And many cryptocurrency investors have been betting that it will stage another comeback and shoot right back up again in value.

But I’m not tempted. The dearth of meaningful fundamentals has always put me off the crypto market. However, that’s clearly been a big mistake. And that’s because if I’d invested in Bitcoin early enough, I’d be a lot richer!

Nevertheless, I’m sticking to my stubborn approach of ignoring cryptocurrencies because there’s a big opportunity in the stock market right now.

The bear market beneath the surface

Many shares have fallen a long way in the bear phase we’ve been seeing. It’s not unusual to find stocks that have plunged by 30%, 50%, and even 80% in some cases. But those brutal declines have been masked by the general indices such as the FTSE 100. Indeed, the Footsie has held up quite well. And that’s because its not equally weighted between its 100 or so constituent stocks.

Instead, a few companies with vast market capitalisations tend to drive the movements of the index. For example, the biggest firms in the index include the mining business Anglo American and oil giants Shell and BP. Pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca is also a big player, alongside banker HSBC and fast-moving consumer goods business Unilever.

If the share prices of stocks like those don’t crash by 80%, neither does the FTSE 100 index. And it’s the same in the other direction as well. Some of the smaller companies in the Footsie can perform very well, but they hardly move the dial of the overall index.

Time to research and analyse

Therefore, despite the relative strength of the FTSE 100, it’s possible that down-moves may have gone too far for many stocks. I’ve been observing for sometime that share prices appear to be disagreeing with the often positive news flowing from businesses. However, that’s not always the case. Sometimes share prices plunge and news flowing from businesses confirms that trading has been deteriorating in the enterprise.

Nevertheless, the big opportunity I see in the stock market right now is the chance to try to find stocks that have been dumped unfairly by the market. And that means, to me, that conditions are perfect for business-minded investors to apply their research and analytical skills.

There are some bargain valuations around that understate the true worth of businesses. All I must do is double down my efforts to find them.

However, even though there is opportunity, it isn’t easy to take advantage of it. Sometimes my judgement will be wrong and the shares I pick won’t go on to perform as well as hoped. Nevertheless, I’m prepared to embrace the risks in the pursuit of long-term gains. And that means working hard to execute my strategy right now."

Our call of the day from Stock Traders Daily and portfolio manager at Equity Logic, Thomas H. Kee Jr., links up the latest crypto selloff and selling of tech names this year to drying up of stimulus-related liquidity.

“When excessive amounts of liquidity flood the economy excessive risk-taking is a natural byproduct, but when the liquidity spigot dries up those assets that experienced irrational exuberance often reprice to more prudent levels quickly,” Kee told MarketWatch in emailed comments on Wednesday.

“Two obvious groups that benefited from the excessive liquidity influenced by stimulus were big tech, and cryptocurrencies. Each of these is being repriced now, because each of these were excessively valued due to stimulus, but these do not represent the overall market,” he said, adding that that selling could be a “precursor to conditions ahead.”

“Although crash conditions are isolated to stocks like Amazon AMZN, +4.46% , Tesla TSLA, +7.67% , Meta META, +7.89% , etc., and virtually all cryptocurrencies, the reason this is happening can affect other asset classes too, just not as acutely or immediately. The broader market, housing, private equity, bonds, all of these assets rely on new money inflows to appreciate too, and the new money from stimulus is gone,” said Kee.

What connects them all is that “new demand for these assets has dried up.”

Read: Tesla stock removed from Wedbush Best Ideas list over ‘Twitter train wreck disaster’

And with central bank stimulus no longer reliable for providing new money inflows, asset demand is now dictated by natural flows. The amount of fresh cash invested in the economy measured by the so-called Investment Rate, he said.

Dating back to 1900, that marker indicates what happens when liquidity peaks and troughs. Kee notes that the peak marks the best time to sell and troughs vice versa, for the purposes of longer-term investing.

“The immediate conditions in our economy today are not crash-like, but the excessively priced assets, those with little or no value, and those that have been hyped, are no longer able to be supported by fabricated demand. That is why big tech is down, that is why crypto has been crushed, but that does not constitute a market crash,” he said.

Kee’s proprietary Evitar Corte Model, designed to flag market crash conditions, isn’t suggesting an imminent meltdown environment right now. But he says the repricing of risk he flagged in his Dec. 21, 2021 Global Liquidity Report has happened. That report also outlined higher volatility associated with low-liquidity environments, also seen this year though it’s “not a market crash, at least not yet.”

“I expect this to spread eventually, but thus far the economic data doesn’t support a need for concern. I will be watching the FOMC and economic data for signs that this will spread. I do expect deflation to exist in retail,” he said.

As for tech, Kee said valuations matter and “those with good valuations can do just fine.” He has buy recommendations on Google parent Alphabet GOOGL, +6.09% and Apple AAPL, +4.86% (read what he said about Apple in September), but warns crypto is “an all out avoid.”

“There was nothing to value in the crypto market, it was pure speculation, and when free money exists, the speculation peaks. Now the free money is gone, and the speculators are not able to push it up anymore,” he said.

Aussies who have some cash stored away in the bank may find they’re missing out on thousands of dollars in interest every year by being stuck in a “dud” savings account.

Australians have a record $1.32 trillion in household deposits, according to the latest APRA statistics, but many savers are earning less than 1 per cent on their hard-earned cash.

However, seven banks are now offering ongoing savings rates above 4 per cent, according to RateCity.com.au analysis.

The analysis found that an existing Big Four bank customer with $50,000 in an online saver could have earnt an extra $880 in interest over the past 12 months if they’d had their money in the market-leading account.

If that same person moved $50,000 into a market-leading account at the start of next month, they could potentially earn up to $1,968 in extra interest.

The calculations are estimates and assume the cash rate reaches 3.85 per cent, as forecast by Westpac and ANZ and that banks continue to pass on similar rate increases, as they have previously on these specific accounts.

RateCity research director Sally Tindall said millions of savers had missed out on hundreds, or potentially thousands, of dollars in interest by being loyal to their bank.

“Some savings customers are still on interest rates below 1 per cent, which is ludicrous when the cash rate is 2.85 per cent and the market leaders are now paying 4 per cent and over,” Tindall said.

“You might be kicking yourself for not acting sooner, but it’s not too late to switch and start earning a decent amount of interest. Even switching savings accounts within some banks could quadruple or even quintuple a customer’s rate.”

Tindall said Westpac eSaver customers were getting a rate of just 0.85 per cent, but Westpac Reward Saver customers were getting 3.5 per cent.

Story continues

ANZ is paying existing Online Saver customers just 0.60 per cent but the same customer could get 3.5 per cent in the bank’s Plus Save account.

“The banks are now willing to offer proactive savers decent rates but they’re still dramatically short-changing complacent customers who have their money in dud accounts,” Tindall said.

“Savers earning less than the cash rate should consider voting with their feet. Banks need deposits to help fund their home loans. The more people switch, the more likely the banks are to chase customers with decent rates.”

49fdf392-3396-4ea6-b283-b9b1107ee0b4,"While repeated interest rate rises are finally bearing fruit for long-suffering savers, not all are benefiting, with some banks being selective in which of their savings account depositors to reward with higher rates.

That means savers who are complacent can easily miss out on a better rate for their hard-earned cash, including situations where better-paying accounts are on offer with the same bank.

Only slightly more than a dozen banks from among the 90 on RateCity’s database have said whether they are passing on last week’s increase in the cash rate by the Reserve Bank of Australia of 0.25 percentage points to savers.

There are two types of savings accounts. Online accounts are those that pay the maximum rate for a limited time, usually three to five months, after which time the rate falls to a lower ongoing rate, whereas bonus accounts pay the maximum rate provided that certain conditions are met; otherwise the rate reverts to a lower base rate."

c956616c-eda5-4b84-9d97-a13d7124b386,"NAB will focus on growing its traditional heartland in business lending rather than push aggressively into the home loan market next year, as the major banks compete to attract a wave of customers who are refinancing their mortgages as a result of rising interest rates.

The bank’s chief executive, Ross McEwan, said NAB would not be pushing to substantially grow its mortgage book in the coming year, even if it meant falling behind competitors, in part due to the margin pressure in the intensely competitive home loan market.

The rise in official interest rates has helped NAB deliver an 8.3 per cent jump in full-year profits. Credit:Jessica Hromas

The big four lender announced an 8.3 per cent jump in full-year cash earnings of $7.1 billion on Wednesday and declared a fully franked final dividend of 78¢ a share, taking the full-year dividend to $1.51 a share, compared with $1.27 in 2021. Small and medium business lending was up 13 per cent over the year while home lending grew 7 per cent.

McEwan said the results, which were broadly in line with market expectations, were pleasing and while all divisions of the bank had contributed to earnings, after 11 years of interest rate reductions, NAB’s earnings had also benefitted from the RBA raising the official cash rate."

National Australia Bank has bumped up annual earnings to more than $7 billion following a “pleasing” year during which it reaped the rewards of rising interest rates.

Australia’s largest business-focused bank reported cash earnings of $7.1 billion for fiscal 2022, up 8.3 per cent from the previous year.

Cash earnings are the banking industry’s preferred measure of operational strength because it strips out volatile and one-off items.

NAB’s bottom line net profit also rose 8.3 per cent, to $6.9 billion, in the year ending September 30.

“Our FY22 results are pleasing,” CEO Ross McEwan said on Wednesday.

The result was attributed to volume growth and cost management, and interest rates.

“After 11 years of interest rate reductions, earnings have also benefited in FY22 from the rising interest rate environment,” Mr McEwan said.

Borrowing rates have been rising steadily since May when the central bank first began hiking the cash interest rate from a historical low of 0.1 per cent.

Mr McEwan pointed to the current economic uncertainty, noting households are likely to be challenged by further rate rises and soaring inflation.

“However, strong employment conditions along with substantial household and business savings give us confidence in the resilience of our customers and the broader economy,” he said.

NAB has forecast Australia’s economic growth to slow to about 1 per cent over each of the next two years from about 2.8 per cent in 2022.

It also predicts the central bank’s cash interest rate peaking at 3.6 per cent in March year, from 2.85 per cent now.

But much depends on how the rate of inflation – currently at a very high 7.3 per cent – tracks over the short term. If it blows out, rates could rise even more.

NAB’s net interest margin – which measures the money it generates from credit products – rose six basis points in fiscal 2022 to 1.65 per cent.

“This primarily reflects higher earnings on deposits and capital as a result of the rising interest rate environment, mostly offset by home lending competition,” NAB said.

Net interest income – the difference between interest-bearing assets (like loans) and liabilities (like customer deposits) – was $14.9 billion, up 7.6 per cent.

But the bank also booked a credit impairment charge of $126 million for the year.

Still, loan “delinquencies” have improved across the bank’s Australian home lending portfolio.

NAB will pay a final dividend of 78 cents, taking the payout for the year to $1.51 a share."
1e8af9c6-11f7-4d73-98b9-f75c6090cfa6,"If you're hoping to retire early, you'll have to find a way to replace your salary without working. Under a traditional model, that means accumulating enough savings that you can withdraw some every year to fund your lifestyle while the rest continues to grow. Short of winning the Powerball, how much do you need to save? Adherents of the FIRE movement — short for financial independence, retire early — aim for a target of 25 times your annual income in retirement. The figure, known as your ""FIRE number,"" is based on the idea that you can safely withdraw 4% of your portfolio per year, adjusted for inflation, without running out of money. This ""4% rule"" comes from a 1998 research report known as the ""Trinity study,"" which examined historical market performance to determine a safe withdrawal rate in retirement. But here's the thing: The numbers in the Trinity study were geared toward people looking for a traditional retirement in their mid-60s. When it comes to using it as the sole basis of your early retirement, experts are skeptical. ""I think it's a terrible idea,"" David Blanchett, managing director and head of retirement planning at PGIM, said at a recent seminar. ""The 4% rule by definition is for a 30-year retirement horizon. You shouldn't use it for 50 years.""

Consider smaller withdrawals for a longer retirement

It's not as though proponents of early retirement are just misunderstanding the study. Although the Trinity study assumes a 30-year retirement, the compounding nature of investment returns means that the math can be applied over longer periods, experts say. ""When you actually look at the math and extend it out over a longer period, in most cases your money is going to triple or quadruple,"" says Grant Sabatier, a leading figure in the FIRE movement and creator of the financial site Millennial Money. ""That's the nature of a compounding curve."" But extending the length of your retirement widens the margin for error in your portfolio, experts say. That means it may be wise to aim for a slightly lower withdrawal rate the longer you plan for you money to last. Researchers at Morningstar say a safe withdrawal rate may lie somewhere between 3.3% and 4%, for instance. ""In general, if you have a portfolio balance and you're planning to stretch your withdrawals out over 40 or 50 years, starting with a lower withdrawal rate gives you a higher probability of success,"" Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning at Morningstar, told CNBC Make It. Aiming for a lower withdrawal rate means you'll need to save more money if you want to fund the same lifestyle. Under the 4% rule, multiplying your income by 25 really means dividing it by 0.04, so if you want to live off $40,000 in retirement, you'll need $1 million. If you plan to withdraw 3.3% per year instead, your FIRE number jumps to $1.2 million.

As costs rise and wages stagnate, it gets tougher and tougher to cover the bills. Having even a few dollars left in checking at the end of the month might feel like a victory. But the focus on covering daily essentials can mean shorting ourselves on retirement savings.

More than 4 in 10 (44%) of workers surveyed by Schwab Retirement Plan Services have “altered” their 401(k) investing, even as they also report that the plan will be their primary source of retirement income.

The survey was based on interviews with 1,000 participants in 401(k) plan in the United States, ages 21 to 70. Almost 8 in 10 (79%) have been hit by inflation, causing them to cut back on purchases, buy cheaper items and throttle back on debt payoff. Even so, the study says, many workers are saving less and spending more in general.

All in all, saving for retirement has gotten harder, due to the following obstacles.

So, if you hope to retire someday, you need to be sure you can afford to do so. Here are six signs you may not be there yet.

You Have a High Level of Debt

Ideally, you would transition into retirement debt-free. Of course, that's not realistic for many people. ""Having some debt, such as a home loan that may offer tax deductions, isn't necessarily a bad thing,"" said Melissa Hannum, an advanced markets specialist with COUNTRY Financial. ""The problem arises when you still have a high level of debt.""

Industry guidelines suggest that your mortgage expenses (including principal, interest, insurance and real estate taxes) should be no more than 28% of your pre-tax household income. Your total debt (housing debt, plus auto loans, credit cards, etc.) should be no more than 36% of your pre-tax income. ""If you are already struggling to keep your debt below these percentages, then you are not ready to retire,"" Hannum said.

Your Spending Exceeds Your Income

Shopping might be good for the economy, but not so much your bottom line. Hannum said that if you're currently spending more than you're earning, then you are not on track to retire.

""While employed, you may think that you'll always have the opportunity to make up for bad spending habits by getting a higher-paying job, getting that annual bonus or even getting a raise,"" she said. ""When you're retired, those opportunities are no longer available.""

That's why it's important to get your spending in check now by creating a budget and sticking to it. ""Having a budget doesn't mean you can't shop, travel or have hobbies -- you just need to account for them,"" Hannum said.

Your Emergency Fund Is Running Low

Even though you aren't receiving a paycheck anymore, the same unexpected emergencies can pop up in retirement. ""A random car repair, appliance mishap or unforeseen emergency room bills can derail a retirement plan and cause an unexpected cash crunch,"" said Jordan Grumet, host of the Earn & Invest podcast and author of ""Taking Stock.""

He explained that retirees should have at least one full year's worth of expenses saved in a liquid and conservative form of investment such as a money market fund, short-term CD or high-yield savings account. If you don't have that yet, you're not financially prepared for retirement.

You Haven't Reviewed Your Portfolio Recently

If you put your 401(k) on autopilot when you first started contributing and haven't really checked it since, Hannum said you may not be ready to retire. ""Taking on excess risk as you near retirement can be extremely hazardous and your portfolio could take a major hit just as you're ready to call it quits,"" she explained.

It's important to make the most of what you have saved up last throughout your retirement years. ""So as you near retirement, you should be shifting your portfolio away from strictly growth-oriented investments and focusing more towards a wealth-preservation strategy,"" Hannum said. It can help to discuss your situation with a financial professional and determine whether or not you should rebalance your portfolio.

You Lack Adequate Insurance

Having enough insurance coverage -- especially when it comes to health insurance -- is crucial in retirement. For those 65 and older, Medicare is available, but it's not free.

Grumet noted that many people decide to purchase secondary insurance, and it's important to consider medication costs as well. ""A person should not retire if they have not factored in medical costs to their budget,"" he said.

You Don't Have a Social Plan

Finally, know that being prepared for retirement isn't just about the numbers. It's also about being prepared mentally, according to Hannum.

""If your social circle is strictly co-workers and Facebook friends, you may not be ready to retire,"" she said. It's important to have a plan in place to stay social and start thinking about ways to meaningfully occupy your time. Consider joining a club, starting a hobby, volunteering and making friends outside the office.

Retirement Tip of the Week: Before you get too far into your retirement, make sense of your assets, your spending and have an easy way to adjust when necessary – if you’re already retired, don’t waste any more time.

The first thing to do is make a list of what retirement or other financial accounts you have – list the investment firm or bank, the balance, and if you can, have an idea of how that money is invested, if it is. If you’re married, make columns for what’s under each person’s name, or where accounts may be joint.

Separately, have a budget – even if it’s only a rough estimate – of what you will be spending in retirement, including housing, utilities, groceries, entertainment, medicine, gifts, taxes and so on. You may not follow a budget religiously, but having a mock up of what your expenses are will make understanding your personal cash flow a lot easier later in life.

If you are feeling ambitious, make yourself a net worth statement, which lists all of your assets (including your house, your car, any stocks or valuables) and your liabilities (including a mortgage, auto loan, student loan or so on). You subtract your liabilities from your assets to get your total net worth – here’s one way to calculate that.

While putting everything together, you may remember accounts you had completely forgotten about, such as a 401(k) from an employer you were with for only a few years, or a pension benefit you may be eligible for based on the company’s requirements.

You might also want to consider consolidating your retirement accounts after reviewing your assets. Too many accounts can be confusing, but don’t consolidate for that reason alone. Balance the convenience of one account with other considerations, such as the balance in each account, the high or low fees within these plans, as well as investment options available (not all 401(k) and IRA plans are created equally – the great investment choices you have access to at Company A won’t necessarily be available in a rollover IRA).

SHARM EL SHEIKH, Egypt

Developing and emerging countries - excluding China - need investments well beyond $2 trillion annually by 2030 if the world is to stop the global warming juggernaut and cope with its impacts, according to a U.N.-backed report released yesterday.

A trillion dollars should come from rich countries, investors and multilateral development banks, said the analysis commissioned by Britain and Egypt, hosts respectively of the 2021 U.N. climate summit in Glasgow and this week’s COP27 event in Sharm el-Sheikh.

The rest of the money - about $1.4 trillion - must originate domestically from private and public sources, said the report. Current investments in emerging and developing economies other than China stand at about $500 billion.

The new 100-page analysis, Finance for Climate Action, is presented as an investment blueprint for greening the global economy quickly enough to meet Paris climate treaty goals of capping the rise in global temperatures below two degrees Celsius, and at 1.5C if possible.

Warming beyond that threshold, scientists warn, could push Earth toward an unlivable hothouse state.

“Rich countries should recognise that it is in their vital self-interest - as well as a matter of justice given the severe impacts caused by their high levels of current and past emissions - to invest in climate action in emerging market and developing countries,” said one of the report’s leads, economist Nicholas Stern, who also authored a landmark report on the economics of climate change.

The report is among the first to map out the investment needed across the three broad areas covered in U.N. climate talks: reduction of the greenhouse gas emissions that drive warming (mitigation), adapting to future climate impacts (adaptation), and compensating poor and vulnerable nations for unavoidable damages already incurred, known as “loss and damage”.

It calls for grants and low-interest loans from the governments of developed countries to double from about $30 billion annually today to $60 billion by 2025.

“These sources of finance are critical for emerging markets and developing countries to support action on restoring land and nature, and for protecting against and responding to the loss and damage due to climate change impacts,” the authors said.

“Emerging market” countries include large economies in the global south that have seen rapid growth -- coupled with rising greenhouse gas emissions -- in recent decades, including India, Brazil, South Africa, Indonesia and Vietnam."

US, Canada, Australia and UK Accused of Falling Short on UN Climate Funding

The U.S., Canada, Australia and the UK have been accused of failing to meet their United Nations pledge for climate change funding.

According to a report by Carbon Brief, a UK-based think tank, the United States fell short of providing its “fair share” of the funding by $49 billion (US $32 billion), while other countries like Australia did not pay $2.6 billion (US $1.7 billion) of the UN’s $155 billion (US $100 billion) finance target.

The Carbon Brief , released on the opening day of the COP27 conference, the UN’s annual climate summit in Egypt, compares national shares of historical emissions with proportionate contributions to the US $100 billion climate finance target.

In 2009, “Annex II” countries, including western European nations, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, agreed to deliver US$100 billion in climate funding by 2020.

Since inclusion in Annex II was based on membership of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) at the time, large economies such as China, which is the world’s second biggest historical emitter of carbon, are not included.

“Other laggards include the UK, Canada, and Australia, which all made smaller financial contributions to the internationally agreed target than their shares of historical emissions,’’ reads the report.

“Canada gave 37 percent of its fair share and was [US] $3.3 billion short, while Australia gave 38 percent of its fair share and fell short by [US] $1.7 billion. The UK gave 76 percent of its fair share, falling short by [US] $1.4 billion.”

On the contrary, Germany, France, and Japan each gave billions of dollars more than their fair shares, although much of their finance is “in the form of loans rather than grants.”

Ecomodernist Says the Environmental Situation Improving

The report comes after California-based ecomodernist Michael Shellenberger commented that the environmental situation was actually improving in developed countries.

Shellenberger, founder and president of Environmental Progress, told the Conservative Political Action Conference in Sydney on Oct. 1 that emissions had slightly declined globally over the last decade with the transition from coal to natural gas, going down 22 percent in the United States between 2005 and 2020.

“Not even the United Nations says that,” Shellenberger said. “It’s true that the planet is getting warmer, but we’ve been doing a really good job of adapting to it.”

“The psychologically damaging effect of social media, the rise of drug overdose deaths in the United States, the crisis facing Europe because of lack of energy, these are all much more important problems to worry about than climate change problems.”

The move sets up a stoush with the Coalition after Opposition Leader Peter Dutton recently recommitted to a policy of giving first-home buyers early access to their super to help them gain a foothold in the property market.

In a speech on Tuesday, Jones said “the vicious cycle of plans to raid super” would continue unless it was protected.

Superannuation by definition adds to inequities in retirement income. — Mike Callaghan

Mike Callaghan, the chairman of the Retirement Income Review, provided the best explanation as to why super tax concessions should not be considered without also considering pensions, and making use of the family home.

“Superannuation by definition adds to inequities in retirement income,” he said.

“Your superannuation is linked to your income, length in the workforce – higher incomes go into higher balances going into retirement. This adds to the inequity.

“The age pension reduces inequities in retirement because it goes with income tests and asset tests. The bulk of that goes to low-income people and goes to reduce [inequity].”

Callaghan says you have to look at the cost of super tax concessions and the aged care system in a cohesive way because a person going into retirement has to deal with these elements.

“One of the most important developments we’ve got is the retirement income covenant, where superannuation funds, if they’re going to deliver on that, have to look at the retirement income strategy for an individual.”

This was the ideal segue for the later conversation with Levy over the Quality of Advice Review.

Levy, who was appointed by former superannuation minister Jane Hume, wants to streamline the regulation of financial advice by imposing a duty on financial advisers to offer “good advice”.

She revealed that her motivation for ensuring every Australian can access affordable advice comes partly from considering the circumstances of her 23-year-old daughter, who she said is disabled.

“I want everybody in the whole financial services industry to be thinking about everybody in our society and prepared to help them all the way through, from when you’re 16 – in her case – and getting a pension, right through to the day that she’s in aged care,” she said.

Levy’s proposal for “good advice” has divided the industry. Her decision to publish a proposed model for regulation of advice – and defend it against criticism – has led some to believe that it will be hard to achieve a compromise.

Australian Retirement Trust chief executive Bernard Reilly said reform of Australia’s financial advice was essential because the system was “broken”.

“The system’s not working. So, we need to be able to provide advice to more people now, as they’re retiring, and before they retire.”

Andrew Boal, a partner at Deloitte Australia, provided some perspective for the discussion about super’s impact upon the federal budget.

“The contributions tax is about 1 per cent of GDP, and that’s going to stay at about the same level for the next 40 years,” he said.

“The cost of the age pensions is about 2.5 to 2.6 per cent of GDP. That’s going to fall to 2.1 per cent over the next four years because of the rising superannuation balances, and that’s great.

“The other one is the investment income tax concessions, currently 1 per cent of GDP, and it’s going to rise to 1.9 per cent of GDP. So, whilst it’s a bit of a problem now, the size of that problem is going to double, and it’s because of the rising superannuation balances, mostly for the wealthy.”

The second-last panel of the day drew out the opinions and frustrations of Millennials who, according to financial adviser Jess Brady from Ladies Talk Money, are not interested in the $5 million super cap debate.

She says super products are not particularly well-designed for young women who are not in the workforce for their entire working life. For example, she says there is no reason to have contribution caps for young people."
458ef1db-7f8e-4e61-8eaa-56873989dd8c,"Dialling down tax concessions for people with multimillion-dollar super accounts would raise billions of dollars annually, narrowing the structural budget deficit, which is estimated to be about $50 billion a year.

Some of the super sector’s influential lobby groups have lent support to the idea of limiting balances to $5 million – a move that would affect at least 11,000 Australians, who receive about $70,000 annually in earnings tax concessions. The policy would save the federal budget about $1.5 billion per year.

Under current rules, retirees with more than $1.7 million in super can leave the excess funds in their accumulation account and receive a generous concessional tax rate of 15 per cent on earnings and contributions, well below the top marginal income tax rate of 45 per cent.

AustralianSuper chief executive Paul Schroder said a person with $5 million in superannuation who earned 6.5 per cent in investment earnings was making $325,000 a year.

“We’ve got plenty of multimillion-dollar members in the fund, so to each of them I apologise for what I’m about to say, but readjusting the tax mix would be beneficial for society,” Mr Schroder said.

But Grattan Institute economic policy program director Brendan Coates said a $5 million limit was still extremely generous, and called on Labor to limit balances to $2 million.

“At $5 million per person, assuming something like a 5 per cent rate of return, that’s implying $250,000 of income each year, per person,” Mr Coates said.

“That is 10 times the value of the age pension. That is still a ludicrous amount of money to have in superannuation on a tax-free income in retirement.”

Mr Coates said a $2 million limit would affect 80,000 people and save the budget $2.8 billion a year. He said it was equivalent to a tax free-income of about $100,000 per year for a single, or $200,000 for a couple who both had $2 million.

At $5m, you’re getting $70,000 in tax breaks

Mercer Australia chief executive David Bryant said the discussion about limiting balances was difficult to conduct without a legislated objective of superannuation.

If the objective were to maintain standard of living and lead a dignified retirement, then a $5 million limit would “comfortably” clear those criteria, Mr Bryant said.

Aware Super chief executive Deanne Stewart said she did not know how much superannuation was too much, but she welcomed the discussion.

“The retirement income review showed that at $5 million, you’re getting $70,000 of tax concessions per annum,” Ms Stewart said.

“That is more than the median income in Australia, just to put that in perspective.”

Australian Retirement Trust chief executive Bernard Reilly said he was unsure of the appropriate limit, but agreed extremely large balances were inconsistent with the idea of superannuation as a vehicle for providing retirement income.

“There’s 16 million Australians who are saving for their retirement who don’t have balances anywhere near $5 million, and we should be setting the policy settings for those 16 million people, not the 11,000 who have balances above five million,” he said.

Equity an objective

But any changes to super tax concessions are likely to face fierce resistance from the Coalition and self-directed retirees, along with some other parts of the warring super sector.

The Coalition’s financial services spokesman, Stuart Robert, said any move by Labor to limit super balances or tighten tax concessions would be a “massive broken promise”.

“Both major political parties went to the election saying no new taxation on super.

“People can’t invest for the future if you keep changing the rules on them,” Mr Robert told the Financial Review.

Financial Services Council chief executive Blake Briggs said last month that changes to concessions would undermine consumer confidence in the objective of the system while raising only relatively modest amounts of revenue.

Mike Callaghan, a former senior Treasury official who advised Liberal treasurer Peter Costello and was selected by the Morrison government to lead a retirement income review, said there needed to be a threshold for how much superannuation was adequate for retirement.

“Superannuation should be on the table and equity should be an important part of that overall conversation both on the expenditure side and on the revenue side,” he said.

Superannuation earnings and contributions are taxed at the concessional rate of 15 per cent, and earnings are not taxed at all when a person is in retirement for pension accounts up to $1.7 million.

Deloitte partner Andrew Boal said the cost of the earnings concession was 1 per cent of GDP, but that was set to rise to 1.9 per cent of GDP in the coming decades as more people retired.

“While it’s a bit of a problem, now, that size of that problem is going to double, and that’s because of the rising superannuation balances mostly for the wealthy,” Mr Boal said. “So that’s the obvious place to target.”

Mr Boal said people earning between $200,000 and $250,000 currently received a larger contribution concession than any other cohort, since the 15 per cent Division 293 surcharge did not kick in until a person earned $250,000.

It means that workers earning between $200,000 and $250,000 make superannuation contributions at a 30 cent discount to their marginal tax rate, which is more than any other group.

Mr Boal said the Division 293 threshold should be lowered to $200,000 on equity grounds.

‘Overwhelming benefit goes to higher earners’

Mr Callaghan said the structure of superannuation tax concessions meant they were not distributed equitably.

“Is the government assistance there targeted for those who need it most? That’s where [concessions] really don’t stack up. If you have a look at the overwhelming benefit of it – it goes to high-income earners,” he said.

UNSW financial services expert Pamela Hanrahan said a debate on policy settings that have been in place for decades should be on the table.

“How do we make sure that policy decisions that we made 20 years ago aren’t being kept just because they’re set in aspic and left alone if they are exacerbating inequity in the broader community?” Dr Hanrahan said.

An earlier version of this article provided two numerical examples of the earnings received by people with balances of $2 million and $5 million. While the figures are accurate, only the earnings on the first $1.7 million would be tax-free."
50474f26-013e-429a-b8af-0b493e559970,"“In a context where the Treasurer has said we have a problem with fiscal sustainability, we need to have a conversation about curbing the growth of government spending or raising revenue, and the superannuation tax concessions have to be in that conversation,” Mr Callaghan said in an interview with AFR Weekend.

“Superannuation tax concessions are growing faster than the cost of the age pension and will be a higher proportion of GDP than the age pension, so they’re heading in the wrong direction in terms of sustainability.”

Mr Callaghan was speaking ahead of the Financial Review’s Super and Wealth Summit on Tuesday, an event that will debate issues such as superannuation tax, Labor’s push for super to invest in social housing and clean energy, retirement income products and the wave of Baby Boomer retirements.

Support for a $5m cap on super

Shadow treasurer Angus Taylor this week ruled out supporting tax increases to fix the structural budget deficit that is estimated to be about $50 billion a year.

The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia supports putting a $5 million limit on the amount of superannuation people can accrue and estimates the government’s budget would receive a $1.5 billion annual boost from doing so for the 11,000 people with balances above the threshold.

Mr Callaghan’s comments suggest the government should look more broadly at the super tax concessions.

Currently, high-income earners facing a 45 per cent marginal tax rate on their wages pay a 15 per cent concessional rate on super contributions and earnings, and less on capital gains inside their super fund.

People aged over 60 can withdraw super tax-free and account holders in retirement phase can be eligible for tax-free investment earnings on their super, under changes introduced by John Howard and Mr Costello in 2006. (Mr Costello is chairman of Nine, owner of the Financial Review).

Robert Carling, a senior fellow at the Centre for Independent Studies, said the Gillard and Turnbull governments tightened super tax concessions, including a $1.6 million limit on super transfers into tax-free retirement accounts from July 2017.

“The bigger the super pot becomes, the more vulnerable it is to tax raids,” Mr Carling said.

“There is a conga line of organisations and interest groups with their eye on extra tax revenue from super to fund their wish lists of new and increased social benefits.

“Large balances have been accumulated because the rules in the past allowed large contributions, and presumably because of astute investment decisions or luck.

“It would be impossible to amass very large balances under the contribution rules now in place.

“Huge balances will disappear from the system as the fund members entitled to them die off.”

Super used for bequests not retirement

Mr Callaghan headed a retirement income review for treasurer Josh Frydenberg in 2020, a mission that was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Among a host of findings, the retirement income review said most retirees pass on the bulk of their tax-concessional super and retirement savings as a bequest to their children, rather than spending the savings in retirement.

By 2050, the cost of super tax breaks is projected to exceed the cost of the age pension.

His review cast doubt on increasing compulsory super contributions to 12 per cent, because the trade-off of lower take-home pay for workers could lead to an unacceptable reduction in living standards before retirement, particularly for lower-income earners.

Mr Callaghan said pensioners renting in the private housing market were the most financially vulnerable, whereas retirees who owned their own home were typically much better off.

“As we see the proportion of home owners declining this is going to become an increasing issue for inequity,” he said.

Pressure to bring the family home into the net

Retirees could live in multimillion-dollar homes but still qualify for a similar age pension to pensioners who are renting and struggling to make ends meet, he said.

“In the first instance you’ve got to do more to support pensioners who are renting.

“Longer term there will be pressure to bring the family home into the pension asset test.”

“The home needs to become a financial asset people can draw on to supplement their retirement through a home equity loan.”

He said housing affordability would not be solved by the Coalition’s policy of allowing people to tap their own super fund, but rather increasing the supply of housing.

Mr Callaghan said policymakers and super funds must also look at the retirement income system more broadly than just the $3.4 trillion super sector.

Advertisement

The age pension, home ownership, aged care and healthcare must be considered part of the retirement income system he said.

“No matter how self-important the superannuation system think they are, they are just part of it,” he said.

“For most people, super is relatively small.

“It’s access to the age pension and pensioner concessions and health concessions, and use of their house and aged care.”

‘Onus is on the super industry to get serious’

Mr Callaghan said it was easy for super funds to accumulate super balances because of government compulsion to put more than 10 per cent of people’s gross wages into super.

But super funds must do a much better job of helping people manage their financial affairs in retirement, as required by the retirement income covenant which took effect in July.

“The super industry really has to live up to the mark and deliver this to have a retirement income strategy for each individual member that takes into account other income sources such as the age pension and worries about the risks such as longevity, aged care and healthcare,” Mr Callaghan said.

“The onus is on the super industry to get serious and deliver on the most important thing to help people use all their assets and manage risks.

“I don’t think they’re all taking it sufficiently seriously and there is some tokenism.”

Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones said tax concessions on super funds are costly to government finances and are being used to amass wealth.

""If the objective of super is to provide a tax-preferred means for estate planning, you could say it is doing its job,"" Mr Jones told the Australian Financial Review's wealth and super summit.

Concessional taxation of super was introduced to encourage more people to save super rather than rely on the pension.

Under the rules, anybody can pay money into their super fund and it is taxed at 15 per cent, which is much less than the 45 per cent marginal rate high-income earners pay.

Mr Jones said there were 32 self-managed super funds with more than $100 million in assets.

""I celebrate success, but the concessional taxation of funds like these has a real cost to the budget which needs to considered.""

Grattan Institute research has found the tax benefits of super tax concession are poorly targeted, with around 50 per cent of the tax benefits flowing to the wealthiest 20 per cent of households.

To make the system fairer, some groups have been arguing for a limit - say $5 million - on how much people can save within the super system.

""The argument goes that you would simply pay income tax at normal rates rather than 15 per cent,"" H&R Block tax expert Mark Chapman explained.

On the other hand, he said the constant tinkering with superannuation was unfair.

""People have been paying into their super for decades under one set of rules, and it's reasonable to assume those rules will still apply when you get to super age,"" he said.

But with government debt expected to grow, Mr Chapman said a $5 million super cap was reasonable to help repair the budget.

Before embarking on reforms to super tax reforms, Mr Jones said he wanted to consult on a common, agreed objective for super.

""With an objective that is settled, we can talk sensibly about tax,"" he said.

Opposition financial services spokesman Stuart Robert said Australians deserved certainty when it came to superannuation.

""Labor went to the election promising to not touch superannuation, yet since the election all we have seen is how Labor wants to change super, including increasing taxes and reducing transparency on super expenditure,"" he told AAP.

The government was seeking to fill a budget black hole with more taxes, he said.

In some cases, it would be replaced with an overarching duty to “give good advice”.

Consumer advocates slammed the proposal. Choice chief executive Alan Kirkland said the re-entry of the major banks to financial advice, a model they largely abandoned following the royal commission, would return the sector to the “bad old days”. Some small business and independent financial advisers have also urged the government to safeguard the best interests duty.

But Ms Levy said she had a personal motivation for accepting the previous government’s offer the lead the review.

“My daughter is 23 and disabled and she needs help with everything that she does. And what I want [is] the whole financial services industry, to be thinking about everybody in our society and being prepared to help them all the way through from [teenage years] to retirement or aged care.”

Consumer protections

Ms Levy told the summit her proposals had in-built consumer protections that were under-appreciated in the national debate sparked by her review.

Under the proposed framework, a larger number of institutions would provide “personal advice” to members and customers, rather than relying on the problematic and limited “general advice” questioned by the High Court in Westpac’s high-profile dispute with the corporate regulator.

“That is a big step up,” she said. “That is a big consumer protection mechanism.” Her proposed duty to “give good advice” would “adjust” to a greater range of client circumstances as more low-balance customers with simple needs were brought into the advice system.

“I don’t think the best interest duty does that,” she said. “It doesn’t cope very well with being an employee at a product issuer, whether that’s a superannuation fund or a bank or insurer.”

Ms Levy said she had been convinced that the industry had done enough to professionalise since the royal commission to warrant some wind back of red tape and paperwork requirements.

Australia’s two largest providers of financial advice, AMP and Insignia Financial, told the summit they had spent much of the past three years stripping out conflicts of interest and improving the quality of their services.

Renato Mota, chief executive of Insignia (formerly IOOF), said he and his counterpart at AMP, Alexis George, had taken the decision that vertical integration – under which insurance and investment products are cross-sold through advice – was “unacceptable going forward”.

“Advice must stand on its own feet,” Mr Mota said. “We need to get the industry structure in a shape where it’s a sustainable business model and isn’t reliant on subsidisation from products or anywhere else for that matter.”

Ms George urged business and consumers to back Ms Levy’s proposals, describing them as potentially “transformational” for the country.

“Australia is the world’s wealthiest country but our financial literacy is pretty poor,” Ms George said. She gave the example of a 19-year-old New Zealander whose super was 100 per cent invested in cash. Under the status quo, AMP would not be able to help that individual without providing full-service advice.

The comments follow a submission to Treasury by the Financial Services Council, reminding the Albanese government of its pre-election pledge to increase access to financial advice.

FSC CEO Blake Briggs said: “Financial Services Minister Stephen Jones has made it clear to the financial advice industry he understands there is an urgent need to reform financial advice rules, with 2600 advisers leaving the profession in the last year alone.

2113b18f-443d-4dfe-9975-691e4cb2def4,"Crypto Exchange Binance Dumping All FTX Tokens on Its Books — CEO Cites 'Recent Revelations'

Binance is dumping all of its FTX token (FTT) holdings “Due to recent revelations that have come to light,” CEO Changpeng Zhao has confirmed. “Regarding any speculation as to whether this is a move against a competitor, it is not,” he added. “Our industry is in its nascency and every time a project publicly fails it hurts every user and every platform.”

Binance Liquidating All FTX Tokens on Its Books

The CEO of global cryptocurrency exchange Binance, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), announced via Twitter Sunday that his exchange is liquidating all of the FTX tokens (FTT) on its books.

The executive explained that Binance received $2.1 billion in BUSD (Binance’s stablecoin) and FTT from exiting FTX equity last year. Binance was an early FTX investor. “Due to recent revelations that have come to light, we have decided to liquidate any remaining FTT on our books,” Zhao wrote.

In follow-up tweets, the Binance boss added: “We will try to do so in a way that minimizes market impact. Due to market conditions and limited liquidity, we expect this will take a few months to complete.” He further said. “We typically hold tokens for the long term. And we have held on to this token for this long.”

CZ also detailed:

Liquidating our FTT is just post-exit risk management, learning from LUNA. We gave support before, but we won’t pretend to make love after divorce. We are not against anyone. But we won’t support people who lobby against other industry players behind their backs. Onwards.

Noting that “Binance always encourages collaboration between industry players,” the CEO claimed that the sale is not “a move against a competitor” as some have speculated. He continued: “Our industry is in its nascency and every time a project publicly fails it hurts every user and every platform.”

Soon after his announcement, CZ admitted that the 22,999,999 FTT transferred to Binance on Nov. 5 was part of his exchange’s FTX token exit move.

Sam Bankman-Fried’s Response

Commenting on the Binance CEO’s tweet about FTT, FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried wrote: “I was going to write a different thread, but I took a deep breath and reminded myself of something we’d all do well to remember: that we’re all in this together, and I wish the best to ‘everyone’ driving the industry forward.” He continued:

Because I respect the hell out of what y’all have done to build the industry as we see it today, whether or not they reciprocate, and whether or not we use the same methods. Including CZ.

FTX published a document titled “Possible Digital Asset Industry Standards” on Oct. 19 which received much backlash from the crypto industry. Bankman-Fried, who is a mega-donor to the Democratic party, has been under fire for his controversial comments on the decentralized finance (defi) protocol. Meanwhile, CZ is a major defi supporter, stating previously: “Binance is investing heavily in defi.”

In addition, some people believe that the FTT sale could also be related to the financial health of Alameda Research, a principal trading firm founded by Bankman-Fried. On Friday, Dirty Bubble Media published an article outlining reasons why Alameda Research’s finances “appear to rest on the same scheme that destroyed Celsius Network.” The article cites a leaked balance sheet.

Soon after CZ made the announcement, the FTX token price came under severe pressure. As of press time, FTT is trading 6% down at a price of $22. The native cryptocurrency of the FTX exchange has lost 20% over the last week. In a sharp message on Twitter, CZ said:

“Liquidating our FTT is just post-exit risk management, learning from LUNA. We gave support before, but we won’t pretend to make love after divorce. We are not against anyone. But we won’t support people who lobby against other industry players behind their backs. Onwards”.

FTX Chief Addresses the Rumors

There have been controversial reports floating with FTX exchange and its sister concern Alameda Research. The controversy notes: “Both these firms have different businesses but the balance sheet of Alameda research shows significant amount of unlocked FTT token worth nearly $3.66 Billion out of total $14.6 billion”.

The controversy is surrounding the illiquid tokens which Alameda Research has been showing on its balance sheet. Hence these major liquidations in the market. Note that both these firms are owned by Sam Bankman-Fried.

In his latest Twitter thread, SBF has come clean addressing the rumors in the market. He said that FTX and its group of companies are highly regulated and that they keep all audited financials. However, he said that FTX users need not panic as all the withdrawals are working fine.

We’ve already processed billions of dollars of deposits/withdrawals today; we’ll keep going. (Taking up anti-spam checks to process more–sorry if you got those. We’re hitting node rate capacity, will keep going.) Also tons of USD <> stablecoin conversions going on.

As the lender delivered a 1 per cent fall in full-year cash profits, to $5.3 billion, King said the bank had not yet seen increases in customer hardship in its loan portfolio, and consumer spending remained healthy across the economy.

However, he stressed that higher rates would inevitably have an impact, as the Reserve Bank tries to rein in inflation by tightening policy, and banks pass through a series of rate rises to mortgage customers.

“We recognise that with borrowing costs, with energy costs, with food costs all going up, that some people will need time, and there might be some write-offs,” King said on Monday"

As Westpac on Monday reported a full-year profit of $5.7 billion, chief executive Peter King said many customers built up savings during the pandemic and two-thirds were ahead on their repayments.

But he said it is ""inevitable"" the impact of higher rates would be felt, including when borrowers' low fixed-rates roll over onto higher variable rates.

""That will be hard for people, and it's important to acknowledge the challenges ahead as customers navigate the tougher environment,"" he said.

As of September, just 1.07 per cent of Westpac's assets were considered ""stressed"", down from 1.1 per cent in March and 1.91 per cent in September 2020.

Just 0.51 per cent of borrowers were more than 90 days behind on their payments, down from 0.56 per cent in March and 0.8 per cent in September 2020.

Mr King said the Australian economy remained robust, but the heat would come out of it as rates rise.

""Housing prices have fallen in recent months and this will continue into 2023. Credit growth is expected to ease. GDP growth will slow and unemployment will rise,"" he said.

""These will be necessary outcomes if we are to lower inflation.""

The bank on Monday posted a better-than-expected earnings result, with $5.7b in net profit for the 12 months to September 30, up four per cent from the year before.

Revenue was down two per cent to $19.9b and cash earnings fell one per cent to $5.3b, beating consensus estimates by 3.7 per cent, according to E&P Financials banking analyst Azib Khan.

At 1.23pm AEDT Westpac shares were down 4.2 per cent to $23.12, the worst performance of any of the big four banks, even ex-dividend ANZ.

Mr King said Westpac's mortgage business grew slower than its peers over the year, but gained momentum in the second half.

He was pleased with the roll-out of the Westpac app, which offers improved self-serve capabilities and a less than two second log-on speed.

Westpac said it was continuing its migration to digital, with the number of Australian branches down 14 per cent over the past two years, to 732, while the number of Westpac ATMs is down 16 per cent to 1,071 over the same period.

Meanwhile, Westpac's number of digitally active customers is up five per cent to 5.48 million, and its digital transactions are up 13 per cent to 356 million.

Australia’s second-biggest bank has posted a “solid” earnings result, after raking in more than $5 billion in a year.

Westpac’s bottom line net profit was $5.7 billion, up 4 per cent, for the year to September 30.

But cash earnings – the banking industry’s preferred measure of operational strength because it strips out volatile and one-off items – fell one per cent to $5.3 billion.

“We’ve delivered a solid financial result and made steady progress on our strategic priorities,” CEO Peter King said on Monday

“We’ve built positive momentum and positioned the company for the future.”

Westpac said it had returned to growth in its key segments of Australian mortgages and business lending.

“We are charting our way through a period of high inflation and rapid increases in interest rates,” Mr King said.

But the bank was yet to see an increase in hardship or stressed assets.

“Many customers built up savings during the past two years and 68 per cent remain ahead on their mortgage repayments,” Mr King said.

“However, it is inevitable that the impact of higher rates will be felt, including when borrowers’ low fixed-rate loans are rolled over.”

While consumer spending remains resilient Westpac expects the “heat” to come out of the economy as higher rates bite.

“Small business is one sector we are watching closely as consumption slows,” Mr King said.

Westpac also noted that it expects housing prices to continue to fall in fiscal 2023, which would likely see an easing in credit growth.

Still, the economy remains robust and the bank said it was well-positioned to handle the road ahead.

Mr King said there was “increased economic uncertainty and volatility in financial markets” heading into 2023.

“Although supply chain constraints are easing, skilled labour remains hard to find,” he said.

“The biggest challenge for the authorities is to contain the high inflation psychology that is now taking hold in the economy.

“In Australia, consumer spending is resilient, but as higher rates bite, we expect the heat to come out of the economy and inflation pressures to ease.

“Small business is one sector we are watching closely as consumption slows.”

Mr Schroder said residential housing required an expected investment return of between 6 per cent and 11 per cent, depending on the development risk that funds take on and share with partners.

“We just did some affordable housing at 10½ because of the development risk.”

AustralianSuper was “not going to take anything less” than between expected returns of 6 per cent and 11 per cent.

“And somebody’s got to make up the difference or reduce the risk or reduce the costs,” he said.

The Albanese government has announced a national housing accord with states and territories that aims to free up land and build 1 million homes in five years, backed by capital from the $3.4 trillion super sector.

The policy is designed to tackle the nation’s housing supply problem by incentivising institutional investors and super funds to be involved.

One of the challenges for institutional investors in Australia is the lack of opportunity to invest in residential housing in large quantities to make it worthwhile.

Institutional investors have also relied on strong property price appreciation in previous years to supplement lower rental yields – a trend that is now reversing due to rising interest rates and falling property values.

Aware Super chief executive Deanne Stewart said the fund had about $1.5 billion invested in residential living premises, comprising mainly retirement homes and build-to-rent, approximately $200 million of which was in about 1500 affordable apartments.

“We haven’t been able to do that at scale,” she said.

“It’s been opportunistic, where we’ve been able to really dive in and get really strong capital growth to complement.

“We’ve really focused on essential worker, because actually, that’s been near really great precincts of hospitals, schools ... and it’s really stacked up.”

She cited returns of “10 plus per cent”.

Development risk sharing with partners was a factor that funds had to consider in their risk-adjusted return expectations, she said.

“We’ve started taking an element of that working with our development partner.”

Australian Prudential Regulation Authority director Margaret Cole said the government’s policy for super funds to invest in affordable and social housing would need to meet the best financial interests of super fund members.

“I think we’d want to understand from a governance and decision-making lens that they’ve gone about that in an appropriate, considered way,” she said.

The head of the government’s quality of a financial advice review, Michelle Levy, said investing in social housing to help people with affordable housing could not be the driving purpose for super fund investments.

The sole purpose test to act in members’ best retirement interests meant funds could only invest in social and affordable housing if the returns were better than other assets, Ms Levy said.

Financial Services Minister Stephen Jones told the summit that investing in affordable and social housing should not be done at the expense of member returns.

The government has pledged an initial $350 million over five years from 2024 to support funding of 10,000 affordable homes, including “availability payments” made by the National Housing Infrastructure Facility to institutional investors and super funds signed up to the accord.

University of NSW professor of commercial law and regulation, Pamela Hanrahan, said she was “nervous about any suggestion that we ought to be investing members’ money in projects that don’t stack up financially, particularly where that’s to plaster over problems”.

“Affordable housing is an obvious example that has been created by other distortions in the tax system and in the arrangements that we have in Australia,” she said."
f14124fa-97d8-4b69-b04c-66700ce8de86,"Thirty years ago, when the Labor government legislated a compulsory superannuation contribution to be paid by employers, few could have perceived just how that pool of savings would grow. At the time, the collective savings of Australia’s various superannuation schemes amounted to less than $150 billion.

Today, the nation’s sum of superannuation assets is more than $3.3 trillion. It is invested in a huge range of assets: publicly traded shares in companies here and overseas; in private ventures; public infrastructure; commercial property; bonds, and much more.

Now superannuation funds are being asked to step up and add their investment heft to the Albanese government’s National Housing Accord, which the government envisages will result in the construction of one million new homes in the five years from mid-2024. It’s part of a trend: Victorian premier Daniel Andrews is also relying on super funds to back his state’s investment in renewable energy.

Federally, the government airily admits its million homes vision is “aspirational”. For their part, the Greens have dismissed it as “a con job” and “smoke and mirrors”."
be4eb68b-5d90-4289-a4d7-f45ab7f5ffb8,"An ambition of the architects of Australia’s universal superannuation system, when it was set up in 1992, was to create what would become a fifth pillar of the nation’s banking system.

That super savings pool has grown to A$3.4trn (€2.2trn) but only a tiny drop of the capital has gone to lending, a sector in which Australia’s big four banks continue to enjoy a near-stranglehold.

Finally, significant changes appear afoot.

Recent global and domestic stock market volatility, together with rising inflation and interest rates, have added to pressure on super funds to look beyond equities and real assets to niche investments – including debt.

Michael Clavi, head of income and markets at Aware Super, says domestic banks are capital-constrained in the current market.

“Given market dynamics in Australia, Aware Super believes there is a lot of opportunity to deploy capital into the Australian credit market,” he tells IPE.

“The domestic market will continue to evolve [to enable] super funds to take a bigger role in providing credit to local enterprises. The prevalence of super funds in the Australian capital market is growing.

“Superannuation is already a dominant force in Australia’s domestic capital markets. Whether it becomes a fifth pillar is a matter of semantics.”

Marcus De Kock, Mercer’s alternatives leader for the Pacific, says: “In the UK, private debt has been a cornerstone allocation for many years for most institutional investors. Australian institutions have lagged behind their global peers.”

There are structural reasons for this, De Kock explains. Australian banks did not have the same challenges as those in Europe and the UK during the global financial crisis, when the private debt market in Europe took off.

Australian banks have recently been reducing their corporate lending – and private debt providers are stepping into the market to fill that gap.

In the current rising-interest-rate environment, De Kock says, institutional investors are starting to see the benefits of private debt.

“Coupons are typically based on a credit spread above a floating rate. With a credit premium of 2-3% above an equivalent bond that can be accessed in the public market, private debt investors are getting a strong income yield and steady returns relative to public markets.”

Insourcing en vogue

The Mercer Super Trust in Australia – which will manage A$65bn when a merger with the retail super fund BT Super is completed – has invested in private debt since 2014.

Its senior private debt investment has consistently returned 6%-plus annually in an era of low interest rates. The fund is aiming to “push its private debt allocation to over A$1bn”, according to De Kock.

Several large super funds have beefed up in-house capabilities to evaluate and manage direct lending.

Among them is Cbus Super, which last year created the position of head of direct debt to implement its debt strategy and build on its billion-dollar-plus debt portfolio.

Aware Super, Australia’s third-largest profit-for-member fund, has invested in the more liquid forms of credit and private debt, mostly overseas, for 15 years. After the global financial crisis, the fund invested with global debt managers to capitalise on the financial market dislocations.

Four years ago, Aware Super established its own in-house direct lending team. Mike Cowell, portfolio manager for credit income at Aware Super, recalls that the fund had little exposure to its home market or New Zealand.

“We participate in the full range of loan formats, risk profiles and sectors”

Cowell says: “We saw an opportunity to offer different solutions to the market and we now participate in the full range of loan formats, risk profiles and sectors.

“Sometimes we lend alongside banks, at other times with institutions, in small clubs.

“Aware Super has been a strongly-growing fund for a number of years, so we have been investing the incremental dollars that flow into the credit allocation into our direct lending portfolio here in Australia and in New Zealand.”

Today, the fund’s internally managed portfolio stands at more than A$2bn. It continues to increase global exposure, including to infrastructure debt, focused on developed markets where there are strong risk-adjusted returns.

IFM Investors, owned by 19 industry super funds, manages A$9bn in diversified debt in Australia.

Hiran Wanigasekera, executive director with IFM Investors’ diversified credit investment team, says: “Our investments extend from fixed-income credit strategies through to private debt, direct lending and special situations.

“There is more focus on debt in general right now because the available return has stepped up quite a lot.”

The A$260bn AustralianSuper is on a path to more than double its debt exposure to A$15bn by the mid-2020s. It is targeting loans in excess of A$100m in the deep, liquid North American and European markets.

The fund recently placed a A$250m mandate with Schroders Capital to invest in debt ranging from corporate to infrastructure.

Increasingly, super funds are looking to corporate debt, a cornerstone of the private debt market in the US and Europe.

IFM Investors is open to corporate lending secured on cash-flow. “We have to understand the strength of the balance sheet and the sort of volatility our borrowers can absorb,” Wanigasekera says.

The majority of Aware Super’s debt investment is in cash-flow lending. Given the current market environment, Cowell says being cautious and selective is key, adding that “interesting opportunities” have opened up in various markets globally."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The chief of Australia's biggest pension fund warned against government efforts to tap into retirement savings worldwide as the country looks to fight economic challenges and prepare for a looming global recession.

Australia has the world’s third-largest pension pool, as its superannuation funds have grown to more than $3.3 trillion from $148 billion over the last three decades.

""I’m terrified that governments around the world will say: 'Oh, we’ve got an economic trauma? Tax the person’s money. We want to build something? Tax the person’s money,'"" said Paul Schroder, chief executive of AustralianSuper.

""It’s easy politics, horrible financial thinking. Terrible for society,"" Schroder, whose fund manages A$260 billion of the country's retirement money, added at the AFR Super & Wealth Summit in Sydney.

Australia's centre-left government has said it plans to scale back tax concessions for pension funds of the super rich, saving billions of dollars annually that could go to bridge a budget deficit gap.

Last month it said it had reached an accord with super funds to look at investing in affordable housing projects, to tackle a crisis in the industry.

Schroder welcomed the plans on affordable housing, but said the dynamics of risk and reward did not often match up from an investment perspective.

""Do we do something on affordable housing? Yes, we do. Does it normally stack up? No, it doesn’t. Usually the risks are too high and the returns are too low,"" Schroder said.

The government has not detailed how it plans to draw retirement funds into affordable housing projects.

Global economies, either already in recession or heading for one, are seen tapping into pension funds to alleviate economic woes. Last week Britain was reported to be planning to reveal a stealth tax raid on pensions this month.

e3358770-101c-44d7-bc05-fcb3d288018c,"But the continuing resilience of the jobs market confirms the assessment of Fed chief Jerome Powell that the US central bank still has “some ways to go” in raising rates to tame inflation. Financial markets now expect official interest rates to peak at 5 per cent to 5.25 per cent next year.

Of course, Powell is in a good position to talk tough, given the US labour market remains strong, with the jobless rate well below the 4.25 per cent level that the Fed believes is the neutral unemployment rate.

‘The Great Pivot of 1974’

But some economists argue that Powell will quickly abandon his aggressive attack on inflation if the US jobs market were to deteriorate sharply, even if price pressures persist.

Some say that confronted with a rising US unemployment rate, the Fed will be tempted to lift its inflation target to 3 per cent, from 2 per cent at present, to justify its shift.

According to Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett, there is a precedent for this in what he terms “the Great Pivot of 1974”.

Back then, the Fed had been tightening through 1973 and 1974 in an attempt to control inflation, which had surged as a result of soaring oil prices. As a result, the Fed pushed its target short-term interest rate from 5.5 per cent to 13 per cent.

But it changed tack, as economic activity plunged, the jobless rate surged, and a brutal bear market wiped 40 per cent off the value of the US sharemarket.

Hartnett predicts that “job losses will be the catalyst for the 2023 pivot”.

Still, other economists are far from convinced that the downturn in the US labour market will be as severe as it was 50 years ago.

They argue that the US jobs market is undergoing a major structural shift, as Baby Boomers are progressively leaving the workforce at a time when the growth in the working-age population has slumped.

The average annual growth of the US prime working-age population is projected to slow sharply to just 0.2 per cent over the next three decades, down from 1 per cent average annual growth over the past 40 years.

Meanwhile, US companies are still struggling to find enough workers. Total job openings increased to 10.7 million in September, well above the 5.8 million unemployed people seeking work.

While this imbalance continues, there’s limited scope for the Fed to execute a 1974-style pivot."

The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) stormed higher on Friday as traders digested the Bank of England’s (BoE) interest rate rise to 3%, and a warning that Britain faces its longest recession since the 1920s.

London’s benchmark index rose 2% by the end of the day, boosted by a weaker pound, while the CAC (^FCHI) advanced 2.5% in Paris, and the DAX (^GDAXI) was 2.4% higher in Frankfurt.

On Thursday, the BoE raised the UK interest rates by 75 basis points, its biggest hike in 33 years. The hike will push up mortgage bills for millions of people in the coming months.

The news initially sent the pound tumbling nearly 2% against the dollar, before it recovered on Friday, leaving it on track for its worst week since Kwasi Kwarteng's mini-budget six weeks ago.

Michael Hewson of CMC Markets said: “The key message was that rates were unlikely to go anywhere near as high as markets were pricing, with the central bank keen to blame the recent mini-budget for the fact that the outlook was so gloomy, and that they were doing their best to try and keep rates as low as possible.”

News in the eurozone revealed that German industrial orders declined more than expected in September, adding to fears that Europe’s largest economy is sliding into recession.

The data showed that new factory orders fell by 4.0% month-on-month, including a 7% tumble in foreign orders. Analysts had expected a much smaller fall, to 0.5%.

Watch: What is a recession and how do we spot one?

Across the pond on Wall Street, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.3% by the time of the European close, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) climbed 0.1% higher. The Dow Jones (^DJI) gained 0.2%.

It came as the US economy added 261,000 jobs in October, more than analysts had forecast. The latest Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) jobs report beat expectations, despite pressure from soaring inflation and rising interest rates. Economists had forecast a rise of around 200,000 jobs over the period.

The Bureau for Labour Statistics said, average hourly earnings rose by 0.4% month-on-month, more than the 0.3% expected, while the unemployment rate rose to 3.7%, from 3.5%.

There were notable job gains for Americans in healthcare, professional and technical services, and manufacturing.

Callie Cox, investment analyst at eToro, said: “Hiring is still strong, but there are signs of weakness creeping into jobs data. Unemployment is starting to tick up again and the labour force participation rate is falling.

""Wage growth is also slowing, which is what the Fed wants to see in the context of higher inflation. Overall, this report shows that the Fed’s medicine is working, which is a step in the right direction if you want to get inflation under control.""

Meanwhile, workers at Twitter (TWTR) are suing Elon Musk after the billionaire started mass sacking across the social media company just a week after acquiring it.

He plans to sack as many as 3,700 workers, representing around half the workforce. The company’s offices are temporarily closed while staff wait to hear if they have been retained or fired.

Employees have filed a class-action lawsuit against the firm, saying the lack of notice is in violation of federal and state law.

What a horrific way to let people go.

Shares were mostly higher in Asia on Friday led by a 5.4% jump in Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index (^HSI) as Chinese markets were lifted by speculation that Beijing might begin to ease COVID restrictions.

The Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) rose 2.4% on the day, while the Nikkei (^N225) fell 1.7% in Tokyo after markets in Japan were closed on Thursday for a holiday.

Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “China’s impenetrable policies have caused a great deal of economic pain, both inside and outside the country. Supply chains, manufacturing and demand have all come under very serious pressure. Any indication that some rules could be relaxed would be an immediate dose of grease in the jarring cogs of China’s economy.

d199e589-2cae-407e-99e0-a87675aab957,"The Investor Group on Climate Change has urged federal treasurer Jim Chalmers and Reserve Bank governor Phil Lowe to quickly mandate climate disclosures, to help companies and investors mitigate risks.

The IGCC is an international set of investor networks that represent over two-thirds of Australia’s investment industry and oversees $100 trillion in assets under management, that is committed to “an orderly and equitable transition to net zero.”

“Climate represents a first order risk to the Australian economy, the financial system, and investors,” said IGCC director of policy Erwin Jackson in a letter seen by The Australian Financial Review.

ASIC chairman Joe Longo led Australia’s participation in the development of the ISSB’s rules that will govern disclosure. Eamon Gallagher

The group is calling on the treasurer to quickly mandate the International Sustainability Standards Board’s rules when they are released early next year because “effective disclosure is critical to managing the systemic financial risks and opportunities associated with climate change.”

“The absence of a mandated disclosure framework is causing companies and investors to unnecessarily spend significant resources on climate-related reporting due to lack of clarity,” Mr Jackson said."
db671a7f-58fd-4cc7-8f8c-7341c82898de,"The regulator also imposed interim stop orders preventing Holon Investments Australia from offering or distributing three crypto funds to retail investors because of non-compliant target market determinations.

“People have told me distributed ledger technology blockchain is an extraordinary opportunity in the way we run business and in our personal lives,” Mr Longo said.

“But if you’re a punter, you have no idea what you’re buying. You really shouldn’t be putting your money into things you don’t understand.”

John Moss, deputy chief executive officer, intelligence, at AUSTRAC, said the existing suspicious reporting around DCE, or digital currency exchanges, is delivering his organisation new leads.

Dr Moss said 1200 suspicious reports were raised in 2019 and that number blew out to more than 8000 in the last financial year.

“This indicates to us a growing sophistication within digital currency exchanges to detect criminal activities and report it to government,” Dr Moss said.

He also pointed out that while the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing (AML/CTF) requirements improved visibility into tracking financial crime, there are still major gaps in Australia’s crypto legislation.

He said transfers on behalf of the customer, the financial services that facilitate the ecosystem, and the safekeeping of assets themselves need to be included in the federal standards on dealing with digital assets.

“All this is growing increasingly important as criminals see it not only as a way of transferring value or the proceeds of crime but a way of growing the proceeds of crime,” he said.

Outside of concern for speculative investments gone wrong and financial crime, the panel discussed how tokenising real-world assets was the key global breakthrough that blockchain-based technologies would deliver.

The World Economic Forum has said that in five years, 10 per cent of global GDP will be tokenised on blockchains.

“Not only will shares, real estate, carbon credits be tokenised, which will represent the ownership of those assets, we can tokenise in-ground materials as well,” said Talis Putnins, a professor of finance at the University of Technology Sydney.

“When you strip out the clearing house, the costs drop dramatically. And a whole bunch of assets that were otherwise transferred in a clumsy OTC [over the counter] market will be instantly tradable. The applications of this are broad.”

Global regulators were moving at a mismatched pace around the world, said Caroline Malcolm, head of international public policy at data firm Chainalysis.

“We’ve seen that over the last 15 years, trying to ban crypto doesn’t really work,” Ms Malcolm said.

“Even if your policy objective is to protect consumers, doing nothing is not a plausible case of action.”"
4447d119-32bd-4375-a017-df05d62f6c25,"He said it was “unsophisticated and incorrect” to suggest that boards and executives only react to high-profile penalties and court actions. He said the much-maligned practice of enforceable undertakings can be effective in getting business to commit to real change.

But Ms Court said she “bristled slightly” at Mr Hastings’ comments. “That’s not good enough,” she said of businesses that prefer to negotiate with regulators only behind closed doors. “That’s not the approach the public expects.”

The comments counter commentary that ASIC would be hesitant to litigate under new leadership following the previous government’s purge of the regulatory top brass.

They come as ASIC faces fresh political pressure, with a new parliamentary inquiry established to scrutinise its enforcement activity, supported by both Coalition and crossbench MPs.

‘Big shift’

ASIC took the unusual step on Thursday of releasing an official list of enforcement priorities for 2023. They included “misconduct involving high-risk investment products including cryptocurrencies”, “misleading conduct in relation to sustainable finance (greenwashing)” and “social media misinformation about investment products”.

Alan Kirkland, a lawyer and chief executive of consumer advocacy group Choice, said he was “encouraged” by ASIC’s transparent approach to enforcement. “Laying out priorities is a big shift for ASIC,” he said. “That sends a really clear warning to business but is also helpful to consumers.”

However, Ms Court clarified that ASIC would maintain its long-standing practice of refusing to comment publicly or name parties involved in active investigations.

The list confirmed ASIC’s preoccupation with cryptocurrency activity, with Mr Longo having warned the nascent sector regularly over past months. ASIC last week announced it was taking its first court action alleging a crypto offering against Gold Coast-based BPS Financial, the owner and operator of Block Trade Exchange.

It also used the powers gained under the design and distribution obligation reforms to stop crypto fund manager Holon from taking new business for 21 days.

Ms Court said ASIC had received more than 2200 reports of misconduct regarding crypto assets or crypto scams between July 2020 and June this year.

Social media influencers who may be giving financial advice illegally without a licence (finfluencers) will also continue to be a regulatory priority next year. It is understood ASIC is closely monitoring a handful of popular social media accounts and has warned finfluencers they risk ten years’ jail if they do not get licensed or alter their content.

Ms Court also sounded a warning over the rise of sustainable finance, and its role in greenwashing.

Other priorities on ASIC’s radar include investment scams, “predatory lending practices and high-cost credit”, “poor governance in the superannuation sector”, “manipulation in energy and commodities derivatives markets” and “unfair contract terms in insurance”.

Ms Court said the regulator’s target areas would “change from year to year, in keeping with the shifting economic factors and volatile risk environment”."
48e860fa-56dc-4767-a16d-583ac0b91eb6,"“I want us to get on with it,” she said. ”We try to bring a matter to conclusion within 12 months of the investigation being commenced.

“I have specifically focused on ensuring matters are moving through the system quicker and more efficiently, so we can get to an outcome. Some lawyers are very helpful. Some are not.”

She said consumers and investors wanted to see misconduct “dealt with swiftly, while the impact of the conduct is still being felt – and it’s topical and important”.

“If we do a prolonged investigation that doesn’t see the light of day for many years, the world may have moved on by that time.

“We are articulating on a more granular level than we have before the kinds of things we are looking at. One of the reasons for that is we get thousands of referrals and reports, so we have to work out which do rise to the top of that big pile.

“This should, or will be, an annual process of looking at the kinds of emerging harms in the market.”

Soon after Ms Court started at ASIC, she said the phrase “why not litigate” – adopted at the behest of banking royal commissioner Ken Hayne – had “not been particularly helpful” and that there might be “a range of more pressing matters”.

‘Never appropriate’

Still, she insisted there was no less determination to take on big cases and test the boundaries of the law. She said ASIC had acted against three of the four major banks over the past year and could not recall the last time ASIC offered an enforceable undertaking during an investigation.

“If there is big institution wide-scale conduct that impacts a range of consumers, then an undertaking is never going to be an appropriate response. It’s always going to be a court-based outcome.”

Ms Court said the five enduring priorities were:

Misconduct damaging to market integrity, including insider trading, continuous disclosure breaches or failures and market manipulation;

Misconduct impacting First Nations people;

Misconduct involving a high risk of significant consumer harm, particularly conduct targeting financially vulnerable consumers;

Systemic compliance failures by large financial institutions resulting in widespread consumer harm; and

New or emerging conduct risks within the financial system.

The 2023 priorities come under three headings; protecting consumers, holding industry to account and maintaining market integrity. They are:



Enforcement action targeting poor product design and distribution of financial products;

Misleading conduct in relation to sustainable finance including greenwashing;

Misconduct involving high-risk investment products, including crypto;

Combating and disrupting investment scams;

Predatory lending practices and high-cost credit;

Misleading conduct and poor governance in the superannuation sector;

Failures to deliver on insurance pricing and coverage promises;

Social media misinformation about investment products;

Governance and director’s duties in property scheme collapses;

Manipulation in energy and commodities derivatives markets; and,

Unfair contract terms in insurance.

Ms Court said the new design and distribution obligations “completely changes the approach to consumer protection in financial services”. However, she warned the outcome of cases may be uncertain as courts set the boundaries of the new laws.

Ms Court also sounded a warning over the rise of sustainable finance and its role in greenwashing.

She said there had been $128 billion net flows into exchange-traded funds with an ESG focus since 2016, and a 157 per cent increase in advisers who claimed to provide ESG advice.

“ASIC will closely monitor misleading conduct and claims of greenwashing.”"

Investing.com -- The Federal Reserve's hawkish messaging drives the dollar higher and brings the rally in U.S. and global stocks to a shuddering halt. The Bank of England is up next, under pressure to match the Fed step-for-step or risk a further erosion of the U.K.'s credibility in global markets. Stocks are set to open lower, with online travel agent Booking (NASDAQ:BKNG) a rare bright spot in a sea of red. Carmakers Stellantis and BMW (ETR:BMWG) fall despite reporting improved results. China's health regulators squash rumors of an imminent relaxation of the Zero-Covid policy, and also squash the nascent Chinese equity rally and oil prices in the process. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, 3rd November.

1. Fed drives the dollar higher with hawkish messaging

The dollar surged to a two-week high as the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate hike and policy messaging brought the global rally in risk assets to a shuddering halt.

The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of developed market currencies, rose 1.3% to 112.79, supported by rising short-term Treasury yields, which continue to suck in capital from around the world. The benchmark 2-Year note yield rose another 16 basis points overnight to 4.73%.

The Fed had on Wednesday had hiked the upper target for fed funds to 4.0%, its highest since the Great Financial Crisis, while Chair Jerome Powell had said that interest rates will have to go higher than previously thought, even if the size of individual hikes from now on is likely to be smaller than the 75 basis points seen at the last four meetings.

2. Bank of England under pressure to follow suit

The Fed’s action puts the spotlight squarely on the Bank of England, which will announce the results of its Monetary Policy Committee meeting at 08:00 ET (12:00 GMT).

Like the Fed, the BoE is expected to raise its key rate by 75 basis points, even though the underlying economic situation is nowhere near as strong as in the U.S. In part, the Bank’s hand is being forced by the weakness of sterling, which fell 1.3% against the dollar to $1.1244 in response to Powell’s latest guidance.

Story continues

Sterling’s weakness is a reflection of a broader crisis of confidence in the U.K. economy, which surveys suggest is heading quickly into recession. The only crumb of comfort for the BoE is that the market chaos caused by the ill-fated administration of Liz Truss has more or less subsided since Rishi Sunak took over as Prime Minister.

3. Stocks set to extend losses; Booking defies the gloom, but automakers can't

U.S. stock markets are set to extend losses at the open, after being rudely disabused of their hopes for an early ‘dovish pivot’ from the Fed on Wednesday.

By 06:25 ET, Dow Jones futures were down 102 points, or 0.3%, while S&P 500 futures were down by 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.5%. The three main cash indices had lost between 1.5% and, for the Nasdaq, a thumping 3.4% on Wednesday.

Stocks likely to be in focus later include Chrysler owner Stellantis (EPA:STLA), which fell in Europe despite reporting a sharp rise in sales as its supply chain problems eased (BMW also posted better sales but its stock fell even more sharply).

One bright spot among the sea of red is Booking, after it made hay with the first proper summer tourism season since Covid. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN), Cigna (NYSE:CI), Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN), Kellogg (NYSE:K) and Exelon (NASDAQ:EXC) all report early, while Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) heads the late roster of earnings updates.

4. China rally stalls as regulators quash Covid relaxation rumor

While the Fed was killing the U.S. rally, China’s health regulators were busy squashing those who had dared to bet on an end to the Zero-Covid policy earlier in the week.

A statement from the National Health Committee dismissed suggestions that this is going to be relaxed any time soon, saying: “We must as ever pay close attention to control of the Covid-19 pandemic and absolutely not in the least waver from the overall strategy of preventing the virus from entering from without, and from rebounding within.""

Chinese stock indices, which had rallied violently on unverified reports that the Politburo would form a new committee to look at ways to move away from a policy that has been a serious drag on the economy this year, fell by as much as 3%.

5. Oil falls as China disappointment outweighs U.S. inventory draw

Crude oil price weakened further in the wake of the Chinese news, completely shrugging off a bigger-than-expected draw in U.S. inventories that suggested demand is still holding up well in the short term in the world’s biggest economy.

By 06:30 ET, U.S. crude futures were down 1.4% at $88.70 a barrel, while Brent futures were down 1.2% a barrel.

By contrast, European natural gas futures rose another 7.8% amid fears that the Freeport LNG facility won’t resume shipments this month after a fire in the summer. Any delayed reopening would keep surplus U.S. gas trapped in the domestic market, depressing Henry Hub prices.

Bank of America: “On the heels of solid growth in establishment payrolls and in light of the November FOMC decision, we revise higher our outlook for Federal Reserve policy rate tightening.”

“We now anticipate 50 basis points rate hikes in December and February [previously 50 in December and 25 in February], followed by a 25 basis points rate hike in March, for a terminal rate of 5.0-5.25 per cent.

“We think the discrepancy between the household survey and establishment payrolls may be enough to keep the Fed inclined to lift its policy rate by 50 basis points in December; when the signal from the data is unclear, the answer from the Fed is usually to await further data. That said, we think risks to our revised FOMC rate path continue to lie to the upside and upcoming prints on CPI inflation and the November employment report will weigh heavily on the near-term path for Fed policy.”

TD Securities: “The Fed needs to restore the balance between demand and supply in the labour market in order to get inflation back on a path back toward its 2 per cent target. The October report still signals a strong labour market that generates new jobs at a solid pace."

Australia’s central bank doubled down on that decision on Tuesday by raising the cash rate by another 0.25 percentage points despite headline inflation soaring to 7.3 per cent in the September quarter.

The stronger-than-expected JOLTS data “tempered expectations about the much sought after Fed pivot”, ANZ economists said.

“Recent US labour market data continue to argue that the Fed has a lot of work to do. There has to be a significant risk, therefore, that the Fed’s guidance is more hawkish than the market is hoping for at Powell’s press conference tomorrow.”

Investors had grown increasingly optimistic that Fed chairman Jerome Powell would hint that future interest rate rises will be smaller, fuelling a recovery across equity markets and a retreat in bond yields. In October, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its best month since January 1976.

This pushed the US 10-year bond yield to an overnight low of 3.92 per cent, before the jobs data jolted it back up to 4.05 per cent. Two-year yields, which are influenced by interest rate expectations, topped 4.5 per cent after sliding as much as 8 basis points earlier in the day.

Traders will closely scrutinise Mr Powell’s post-meeting comments for guidance on the future path of interest rates.

“Any sniff, hint or even imagination of anything mildly dovish in nature, and we could witness an outlandish rally in bonds,” said Scott Rundell, chief investment officer at Mutual Limited.

Recession alarms

The intense focus on the labour market overshadowed a separate report which showed that US manufacturing neared stagnation in October.

The Institute for Supply Management’s gauge of factory activity retreated to 50.2 for the month, the lowest since May 2020. Economists were expecting a reading of 50, the level which separates expansion and contraction.

Orders contracted for the fourth time in five months, while the sub-index of prices paid fell to a more than two-year low.

Comments in the survey also pointed to lessening price and supply chain pressures, National Australia Bank economists noted.

The report stoked concerns that both the US and global economy were approaching a recession as central banks battled to keep a lid on soaring inflation.

“Manufacturing will endure more pain as demand weakens at home and abroad while prices stay high and interest rates remain fairly elevated,” said Oren Klachkin, lead US economist at Capital Economics.

The Bank of England will meet later this week and is also expected to deliver a 0.75 percentage point increase as part of its fight against inflation which reached a 40-year high of 10.1 per cent in September.

Andrew Bailey said the bank was forced to step in ""quickly"" and ""decisively"" to mitigate a ""very real threat to financial stability"" after markets were spooked by the calamitous Stg45 billion ($A80 billion) tax giveaway.

""We certainly reached a point where markets were very unstable, and these were core markets, this is the government bond market, which is in many ways the most core of all,"" he told Channel 4 News on Thursday.

""And it was becoming unstable and it was affecting ... pension funds for instance, and how they were operating.

""And our worry was that when you get into that situation, this can easily spread very rapidly and then you have a huge job on your hands to get it back under control.

""So we had to step in quickly and we had to step in quite decisively.""

Asked if the UK was days, even hours, away from potential total meltdown, Bailey said: ""I think at that point when we intervened, I can tell you that the messages we were getting from the markets were that it was hours.""

Bailey's comments came after the Bank of England announced its biggest interest rate increase in three decades as it tries to beat back stubbornly high inflation, boosting its key rate by three-quarters of a percentage point to 3.0 per cent."
19d61687-61fb-4f8b-acd9-468d420e8895,"We're nearing the halfway mark of the 2022 NFL season, and the quarterback landscape has brought plenty of surprises through eight weeks. Starters who were on shaky ground in the preseason are now in the MVP hunt. Former backups are making a case to earn big money in the offseason with solid play. Star signal-callers are struggling to get going -- and some veterans have already been benched. Then there's the growing concern around the once-heralded group of 2021 draft class quarterbacks.

We called on Matt Bowen, Jason Reid and our NFL Nation reporters to answer 15 big questions around the game's most important position. Which slumping passers can still turn things around, and which ones should we worry about in the second half? Can Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers get back on track? Is Geno Smith's breakout for real? And what should the Colts do next?

Let's dive in, starting with our ranking of the top five performers under center in the game right now.

Who are the NFL's top five QBs right now?

Matt Bowen, NFL analyst:

1. Josh Allen, Bills

2. Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs

3. Jalen Hurts, Eagles

4. Tua Tagovailoa, Dolphins

5. Lamar Jackson, Ravens

Tagovailoa jumps into my top five at the midway point of the season. He is now the NFL leader in total QBR (78.7) and plays in a system built around his traits as a thrower. Tagovailoa can continue to produce numbers as a rhythm passer who delivers the ball with timing and accuracy. In six games, he has 1,678 passing yards, 12 TD throws and three interceptions while completing just under 70% of his passes.

Jason Reid, Andscape senior NFL writer:

1. Josh Allen, Bills

2. Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs

3. Jalen Hurts, Eagles

4. Lamar Jackson, Ravens

5. Geno Smith, Seahawks

I agree with Matt that Allen still holds the top spot -- but not by much over Mahomes. Smith, meanwhile, enters my top five. He leads the league in completion percentage at 72.7% and has been outstanding.

Fill in the blank: Aaron Rodgers' biggest problem this season is _______.

Rob Demovsky, Packers reporter: He can't throw deep. Rodgers doesn't have the time or the resources to do it this year. An offensive line that has been in flux hasn't given him the necessary protection, and he lacks a legitimate deep threat. His yards per pass attempt of 6.6 is on pace for the lowest of his career and would be only the second time he has averaged fewer than 7 yards per attempt. And over the previous two seasons combined, Rodgers has averaged 8 yards per attempt.

Which struggling QB are you most concerned with at the moment, and how can he turn it around?

Bowen: Zach Wilson, Jets. He continues to struggle with decision-making late in the down, and his frenetic play style has led to too many negative situations. A quick fix? More defined throws and play-action concepts for Wilson to get the ball out to a talented group of perimeter targets in New York.

Reid: Trevor Lawrence, Jaguars. His two interceptions were crushing in a Week 7 loss to the Broncos, and he has struggled throughout the team's five-game losing streak. In three of the losses, Lawrence failed to post a Total QBR of at least 32.0. That won't cut it. He has to make better decisions with the football.

How worried are the Ravens about the lackluster passing offense around Lamar Jackson?

Jamison Hensley, Ravens reporter: Not much, despite injuries to Mark Andrews and Rashod Bateman. The Ravens have proved they can consistently win in the regular season without Jackson throwing the ball. Baltimore is 24-2 (.923) when Jackson attempts 25 or fewer passes. The concern comes in the playoffs, when teams have shown they can shut down Baltimore's ground game. Jackson, who is 1-3 in the postseason, needs to become more consistent as a passer (three touchdowns, five interceptions) if the Ravens want to make a championship run.

Fill in the blank: Tom Brady's biggest problem this season is _______.

Jenna Laine, Buccaneers reporter: Interior protection. The Bucs' interior pass-blockers have produced a pass block win rate of 87.9% through eight games, second worst in the NFL. The interior line is also responsible for 34 Brady incompletions, the most in the NFL for any quarterback.

Last week, they had backup Nick Leverett in at left guard while struggling rookie Luke Goedeke nursed a foot injury, and the results were slightly better. Tampa Bay's 90.5% interior pass block win rate was 20th in the league last week, their third-best mark of the season, but this deficiency could be particularly problematic this week against Aaron Donald and the Rams.

Which QB has taken the biggest step forward this season?

Bowen: Geno Smith, Seahawks. The veteran quarterback has completed 72.7% of his passes through Week 8 and ranks fourth in total QBR (66.6). Decisive with the ball, Smith is seeing it fast from the pocket and playing at a really high level.

Reid: Jalen Hurts, Eagles. Everything he's doing right now is fabulous. The confidence he exhibits is inspiring the entire Eagles organization, and it's easy for him to be confident when he's producing like this. Talk about a massive step forward.

Has anything changed over the past month for Jalen Hurts, for better or worse?

Tim McManus, Eagles reporter: If Sunday's game against the Steelers was any indication, he has grown even more as a passer. Almost all of his stats this year have been among the best in the league, but his numbers against the blitz were the exception through six games, as he ranked 25th in completion percentage (55.6%) while throwing just two touchdowns there. But against Pittsburgh, he completed 11 of 17 passes against blitz (65%) for 179 yards and three scores. It's just one more box he's checking off en route to becoming a complete quarterback.

How can the Steelers maximize Kenny Pickett within their scheme?

Brooke Pryor, Steelers reporter: There are two schools of thought here. One, the Steelers could lean more on their more experienced run game and take the ball out of Pickett's hands. Or two, they could lean into Pickett's big-play potential and let him open up the passing game on earlier downs.

Guys like former coach Bill Cowher advocate for the former, while former Pittsburgh QB Ben Roethlisberger voiced support for the latter in his weekly podcast. One thing seems clear, though, for the Steelers to get more out of Pickett. They need to try for more splash plays and mix up their 12-14-play drives full of quick-hitters.

""Anytime you're having those 10-, 12-, 14-play drives -- regardless of the offense, regardless of the team -- there's going to be margin for error,"" quarterbacks coach Mike Sullivan said. ""... We'd love to have some of those four- or five-play drives and six points, and so continue to try to work towards that.""

Changing the tempo, making the offense less predictable and giving Pickett the opportunity to be the offensive spark can maximize his skillset as a mobile quarterback with a moderately strong arm.

What is the biggest difference in Geno Smith's game from what we've seen in the past?

Brady Henderson, Seahawks reporter: Smith is taking better care of the football than he did early in his career, when he committed the third-most turnovers in the NFL over 2013-2014 (41). He has just four turnovers this season, though.

Smith filled in for Russell Wilson for three-plus games last season, but he's clearly more comfortable in Year 2 in Shane Waldron's offense and has earned more trust from Seattle's coaching staff. Remember, he played well enough to give the Seahawks a chance to win in all of those 2021 appearances, averaging 26 attempts in his three starts while executing offensive game plans that weren't asking as much of him as the Seahawks are asking of him now. Smith is averaging more than 31 attempts per game this season.

We've seen 18 Zach Wilson starts. Is the organization comfortable with him as its franchise quarterback?

Rich Cimini, Jets reporter: It's hard to be comfortable with a quarterback who is a 55% career passer, with only 12 touchdown passes and 16 interceptions, but the Jets remain confident he will continue to develop into what they envisioned when they chose him No. 2 overall in 2021.

Frankly, it's hard to agree with that considering his full body of work. His physical traits and talent are unquestioned; the issue is above the shoulders. Wilson has a maddening tendency to try to create something out of nothing, and it results in games like last week against the Patriots (three interceptions). He needs to remember he's not at BYU anymore. Wilson's 35.8 QBR since entering the NFL is 32nd out of 33 qualified quarterbacks over that time, ahead of only Baker Mayfield.

Are the Colts more likely to start over and draft a quarterback in 2023 or again look for a quick fix via free agency or trade?

Stephen Holder, Colts reporter: The Colts appear ready to finally get off their four-year ride on the QB carousel. They have started each of the four seasons since Andrew Luck's retirement with a different starter, and it has completely undermined any effort at continuity for the franchise. The benching of Matt Ryan was the biggest indicator the Colts are ready to turn the page. The only question seems to be whether Sam Ehlinger gives them a reason to think he can be their guy.

The 2023 draft class includes multiple highly regarded QB prospects, including Ohio State's C.J. Stroud, Alabama's Bryce Young and Kentucky's Will Levis.

How much concern is there about Matthew Stafford's interception rate?

Sarah Barshop, Rams reporter: There doesn't seem to be any concern among the coaching staff or Stafford himself, especially after he did not throw an interception in Sunday's loss to the 49ers. McVay and Stafford have both said this season that every interception has a different story, and they're often not related to each other. Five of Stafford's eight interceptions this season came in the Rams' first two games, so he has shown an improvement there as the season has gone on.

There have been plenty of issues with consistency in this Rams offense, but Stafford's interception rate (2.9% of his pass attempts) isn't at the top of that list.

Are the Patriots wavering on Mac Jones, and could they explore other options in the offseason?

Mike Reiss, Patriots reporter: No, they aren't wavering. If anything, coach Bill Belichick is going out of his way to show public support for Jones, which included a big on-field embrace after Sunday's win against the Jets, and then another jovial meeting in the tunnel before they boarded the buses to depart East Rutherford, N.J.

Belichick often says that he leaves the big-picture evaluations like this for the offseason, when there is more time to assess without the daily grind of game-planning, so there's always the possibility the team could explore other options for the future. But there has been zero indication -- publicly or behind the scenes -- that the team is thinking along those lines at the moment.

""Pass-blocking needs to be better. That would help,"" Belichick said this week, in one example of how he's going to bat for Jones.

What will Marcus Mariota have to do better if the Falcons want to reach the playoffs?

Michael Rothstein, Falcons reporter: It starts with his accuracy, which can be questionable at times. He's completing 62.9% of his passes, which is actually the second-highest rate of his career and tied this season with former teammate Derek Carr. If Mariota can increase his accuracy and find ways to create chances for tight end Kyle Pitts, wide receiver Drake London and running back Cordarrelle Patterson when he returns, it should offer a diversification of Atlanta's run-heavy offense and create success for the Falcons in a manageable way.

Pick one 2020 draft class QB to start an NFL franchise with right now.

Bowen: Joe Burrow, Bengals. It's still Burrow for me. Consider the throwing traits, pocket mobility and toughness in his game. Burrow has the makeup and intangibles of a franchise quarterback in this league.

Reid: Justin Herbert, Chargers. Nothing against Burrow or Tagovailoa, but Herbert remains underrated by many despite the fact that he's spectacularly talented. Herbert possesses all the physical tools and all the intangibles needed to lead a team to success. He would thrive as the cornerstone of any franchise."

People cites a source close to the billionaire who says a potential Bezos bid might include music mogul Jay-Z as an investor because of their mutual interest in the NFL team.

The Washington Post, which Bezos owns, also confirmed the report, which comes a day after the Commanders announced Snyder and his wife Tanya have hired BofA Securities to ""consider potential transactions"" involving the team -- which could include a complete sale or a percentage ownership stake.

Bezos has expressed interest in owning an NFL team in the past, in particular the Seattle Seahawks.

Amazon gained a share of NFL broadcasting pie this season, purchasing rights to stream the league's ""Thursday Night Football"" games on Prime Video in a $50 million, one-year deal.

Snyder, who has been the Washington franchise's majority owner since 1999, has been the subject of multiple investigations into allegations of sexual harassment and financial impropriety.

Last year, the NFL levied a $10 million fine against Snyder and the Commanders for fostering a ""highly unprofessional"" workplace culture. The controversy surrounding the team has also proved to be a stumbling block in reaching a deal with local officials to build a new stadium."

The Amazon founder and multibillionaire has expressed interest in purchasing the team, possibly in collaboration with rapper and music industry giant Jay-Z, The Washington Post and Bloomberg reported Thursday, each citing a single source. The Washington Post is owned by Jeff Bezos. People reported Bezos' interest earlier Thursday.

Jeff Bezos is interested in bidding for the NFL's Washington Commanders, multiple news outlets reported Thursday.

Snyder's financial misconduct is also the subject of a federal criminal probe from the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, according to ESPN.

Bezos has a home in Washington, D.C., which is near the Commanders' stadium in Maryland. His interest in buying a sports team has been widely reported. NBA star Shaquille O'Neal said that Bezos ""scared"" him away from making a bid for the ownership of the Phoenix Suns, another team whose owner is marred in controversy.

Representatives for Bezos did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Other potential bidders for the Commanders include media mogul Byron Allen, according to Bloomberg, which cited people familiar with the matter. Allen was reportedly approached to buy the Denver Broncos franchise, which was eventually bought by members of Walmart's Walton family.

Amazon's Jeff Bezos and rap mogul Jay-Z are reportedly among the high-profile names interested in purchasing the Washington Commanders from Dan Snyder.

Charlotte Triggs and Natasha Dye of People reported Bezos is ""looking into buying the Washington Commanders,"" while TMZ Sports reported a partnership between Bezos and Jay-Z is ""on the table.""

Snyder announced his intention to explore a full or partial sale of the Commanders on Wednesday, though the team offered no promises to actually sell the team.

""Dan and Tanya Snyder and the Washington Commanders announced today that they have hired BofA Securities to consider potential transactions,"" the statement read. ""The Snyders remain committed to the team, all of its employees and its countless fans to putting the best product on the field and continuing the work to set the gold standard for workplaces in the NFL.""

Snyder has owned the team since 1999, a period that has seen the franchise go from one of the NFL's beacons of success to arguably its biggest embarrassment. Washington has won only two playoff games over the course of Snyder's tenure and has alienated one of the league's most loyal fanbases.

The Commanders went from having a 50-year sellout streak to currently sitting last in the NFL in attendance. Much of that malaise can be attributed to Snyder, who refused to change the team's racist nickname for decades and made a series of personnel gaffes that left Washington consistently near the bottom of the NFC East.

The situation reached a head amid an investigation that found rampant sexual misconduct and verbal abuse within the organization over Snyder's tenure, along with a Congressional investigation into alleged financial impropriety from Snyder. Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay called out Snyder to reporters last month.

""I think it's something that we have to review, we have to look at all the evidence and be thorough in going forward, but I think it’s something that has to be given serious consideration,"" Irsay said when asked if owners should remove Snyder.

Bezos is the fourth-richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of $113.1 billion. Amazon has been expanding its business into live sports, with the conglomerate taking over Thursday Night Football rights earlier this year. It's unclear if the Amazon relationship with the NFL would be allowed to continue if Bezos purchased the Commanders.

Jay-Z would be a minority owner in any group, given his net worth ($1.5 billion) is likely only a third (or less) of what Snyder could get for the Commanders on the open market. The rapper previously owned a piece of the Brooklyn Nets."
0861489a-e375-4b6f-b2df-d4b6f7461a18,"US attorney's office in the Eastern District of Virginia has begun a criminal probe into alleged financial improprieties by the Washington Commanders, ESPN reported Wednesday afternoon.

The report comes hours after news that Commanders owners Dan and Tanya Snyder hired Bank of America Securities to help with a potential sale of the team.

The report comes months after the US House Committee on Oversight and Reform sent a 20-page letter to the Federal Trade Commission laying out allegations that Daniel Snyder withheld refundable deposits from ticket holders and hid revenue from the NFL.

The NFL declined comment to ESPN when asked directly if it was aware of the federal criminal probe.

'The NFL in April engaged former SEC chair Mary Jo White to look into this matter,' NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy told ESPN. 'The review is ongoing.'

Attorney generals in Virginia and Washington, D.C., are also investigating allegations of deceptive business practice and financial improprieties by the organization.

Dan Snyder is now reportedly considering selling the franchise, which is valued at $5.6 billion

The team released a statement earlier Wednesday regarding a potential sale of the Commanders.

'The Snyders remain committed to the team, all of its employees and its countless fans to putting the best product on the field and continuing the work to set the gold standard for workplaces in the NFL,' the team announced.

According to a report Wednesday from Forbes.com, Snyder has already received 'at least four calls' from parties interested in purchasing the team.

Snyder is said to be exploring all options, including selling the entire franchise or a minority stake.

There have been calls for Snyder to sell over recent years, though he's resisted until now

'Any potential transaction would have to be presented to the NFL Finance Committee for review and require an affirmative vote by three quarters of the full membership (24 of 32 teams),' league spokesperson Brian McCarthy said in a statement on Wednesday.

In August, Forbes valued the Commanders at $5.6 billion, sixth among the NFL's 32 teams. Snyder also owns FedEx Field and the 264-acre property that surrounds it, plus the 150-acre team headquarters in Ashburn, Va.

Sponsorship revenue has increased by 40 percent this season over 2021 since the team rebranded from the Washington Football Team to the Commanders, according to Forbes.

BofA Securities, previously known as Bank of America Merrill Lynch, provides services in mergers and acquisitions.

The Commanders are 4-4 this season, but sit last in a highly-competitive NFC East division

'We understand the challenges our clients face around the world,' reads the company's website. 'We combine local knowledge and global perspective to tailor solutions to meet clients' goals.'

The bank handled Steve Ballmer's 2014 purchase of the Los Angeles Clippers.

Snyder, 57, bought the team, then known as the Washington Redskins, in 1999.

Snyder's wife, Tanya, has been in charge of day-to-day operations since July 2021 when the NFL fined the team $10 million for fostering a toxic workplace culture.

The discovery of potential financial impropriety came amid the committee's investigation into sexual harassment within Washington's workplace. The committee began to look at the financials after combing through 80,000 pages of documents and witness interviews regarding sexual harassment, the Washington Post reported on March 31.

The financial allegations center on the testimony of Jason Friedman, who worked for the franchise for 24 years. He held the title of vice president of sales and customer service when he was let go by the club.

Friedman told the committee that the team kept 'two sets of books' to underreport ticket revenue to the NFL. Revenues from Commanders games would instead be shown as derived from non-NFL events, like college football games or concerts. Those monies were called 'juice' -- extra money for the team and kept hidden so as to not be subject to the NFL's revenue-sharing pool, per the letter.

The committee also indicated that Snyder withheld as much as $5 million in refundable deposits from season ticket holders."
3116ffff-84cc-43d6-a485-8662f3a7bb0a,"“Grant and Danny” of 106.7 The Fan hit the jackpot Wednesday. Their show revolved around the Daniel Snyder announcement of potentially selling some or all of the Commanders.

Guests for Grant and Danny included ESPN’s Seth Wickersham, John Ourand of Sports Business Journal, Lisa Banks of Katz, Marshall and Banks, Virginia State Senator Jeremy McPike, the Washington Post’s Barry Svurluga, Pro Football Talk’s Mike Florio, Congresswoman Jennifer Wexton, Richmond Times Dispatch’s Michael Phillips. They also had former Washington QB Kirk Cousins as well.

Of course, Cousins was there to talk football, and all of the rest were ready to talk Daniel Snyder.

Wickersham believes today was a monumental day because not only did Snyder make the move with Bank of America, but the team also clarified even more that they are exploring all options. Translated, they sent out an invitation to billionaires to place their opening bid, and let’s see where this goes.

Florio, who has certainly been no fan or supporter of Snyder, shared he had an exchange with an NFL insider. “When I sent that statement to somebody who knows how the NFL sausage gets made, who’s intimately involved in league matters, the reaction was ‘this statement says if we get the number we like, we’re the selling the team’.”

Paulsen was willing to say what any NFL ownership would most likely never wish to have known. Paulsen stated confidently, “To me this all but confirms the team needs money. They need an injection of cash. But who in their right mind with that kind of money would ever be a minority partner for the Snyders? His only hope would be to try to get a well-liked celebrity to buy in and be front facing.”

Space does not permit here, but might it suffice to say, for now, money does not buy happiness? The Snyders are billionaire owners of an NFL franchise. Yet, consider all of the losing of games, the losing of the fan base, the past few years of investigations, bad press and being despised and wished gone by virtually every single fan of the franchise.

With all of that, perhaps might the Snyders now simply want to sell out and live a quiet, peaceful life in luxurious wealth?"

TMZ, which first reported the news, claims that a joint bid between the 52-year-Shawn 'Jay-Z' Carter and the 58-year-old Bezos is 'on the table.'

Snyder is considering selling the NFL franchise following years of controversy surrounding everything from the team name to accusations of sexual harassment. It remains unclear if he would sell the entire team or if he's just looking to add a minority partner.

Snyder has retained Bank of America to sell the Commanders, the club announced Wednesday.

The 57-year-old billionaire already has four interested potential buyers, Forbes reports. The Commanders (4-4) are worth roughly $5.6 billion - sixth best among NFL teams - according to Forbes. Snyder bought the club for a reported $800 million in 1999.

A spokesman for the rapper and Snyder did not immediately respond to DailyMail.com's request for comment.

A fan holds up a sign for CEO and founder of Amazon Jeff Bezos during a game between the New York Jets and Washington Redskins at FedExField on November 17, 2019 in Landover, Maryland. Bezos was linked to a potential sale at the time, but it never came to fruition

Both Jay-Z and Bezos were previously rumored to be interested in buying NFL teams, but instead made moves to partner with the league.

In 2019, the NFL announced a partnership with Jay-Z's Roc Nation to organize live performances at league games, such as the halftime show at the Super Bowl.

Bezos, who ranks among the world's richest men with an estimated net worth of $120 billion, owns Amazon, which bought the rights to Thursday Night Football for $1 billion per season.

An NFL spokesman did not immediately respond to DailyMail.com's question asking if their existing deals with the league would preclude Jay-Z and Bezos from becoming team owners.

The Commanders are currently facing a litany of scandals, including a federal probe into allegations of financial malpractice. Previously, attorney generals in Virginia and Washington D.C. announced similar probes into claims that Snyder withheld refundable deposits from ticket holders and hid revenue from NFL teams.

News of a potential sale follows comments from Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay urging the NFL to remove Snyder as Commanders owner. Speaking at last month's league meetings in New York, Irsay said 'there's merit' to booting Snyder, who ranks as one of the least popular owners in professional sports.

For starters, the Commanders have been terrible since Snyder bought the club in 1999. Washington, a three-time Super Bowl winner and five-time NFL champion, has reached the postseason only six times over Snyder's tenure. The current head coach, Ron Rivera, is Snyder's 10th since taking control of the team.

The reference to the 'gold standard for workplaces in the NFL' is curious, given that the team is under investigation by Congress over sexual harassment and hostile workplace claims

The team's former minority owners consisted of FedEx Corp. CEO Fred Smith, Black Diamond Capital chairman Robert Rothman (right) and NVR Inc. board chairman Dwight Schar (left), who controlled a combined 40 percent stake worth roughly $1.4billion, according to Forbes' $3.4billion valuation in 2019. They have since sold their shares to Snyder amid a contentious breakup between the ownership group

FedEx Corp. CEO Fred Smith (pictured) thought he found a buyer for the Commanders in 2020, but the deal was never finalized because Snyder was refusing to sell at the time

Throughout Snyder's tenure, the team has been criticized for its now-former nickname, the Redskins, which is considered offensive to Native Americans.

The Washington team finally rebranded in 2022 as the Commanders after dropping its Redskins name in 2020 under a wave scrutiny following the George Floyd protests.

In 2021, Snyder bought out minority partners Fred Smith, Dwight Schar and Bob Rothman for a reported $875 million after years of infighting.

Smith, Schar and Rothman have been hoping to sell their shares for much of 2020. In fact, Smith reportedly negotiated a $900 million sale for the shares, according to the Washington Post, but Snyder blocked the sale, prompting Smith, Schar and Rothman to sue him in federal court.

In response, Snyder sued an Indian media company, MEA Worldwide, claiming they took part in a smear campaign against him that was organized by Schar in order to force him to sell his stake.

The club currently faces a criminal investigation in Virginia, where the Commanders are accused of financial malpractice for allegedly swindling season ticket holders out of security deposits and improperly withholding ticket revenue from NFL teams. The Commanders have denied these claims.

Furthermore, the Commanders are the subject of a congressional investigation into sexual harassment and hostile workplace allegations.

Various reports have detailed claims of sexual harassment made by female ex-employees against male co-workers and supervisors, many of whom have since been dismissed.

Sexual harassment allegations against team employees ranged from inappropriate comments to the creation of a lewd behind-the-scenes video from a cheerleader calendar shoot in 2008, according to a 2020 Washington Post report that first publicized the claims.

Furthermore, a former cheerleader also alleged that team owner Dan Snyder suggested that she join his 'close friend' in a hotel room in 2004 so they 'could get to know each other.'

Those revelations prompted a team investigation handled independently by DC-area attorney Beth Wilkinson, but the league quickly assumed control of that probe with Wilkinson's team reporting to the commissioner's office.

The NFL then issued a $10 million fine to punish the club (which is worth an estimated $4.2 billion) and Snyder volunteered to cede day-to-day control of the team to his wife, Tanya.

Ex-Commanders employee Tiffani Johnston told Congress' Oversight Committee that Snyder once groped her thigh during a team dinner and pushed her toward his limousine with his hand on her lower back. Snyder has denied the allegation

But the league's refusal to release a report on its investigation, citing privacy concerns of witnesses, prompted the Oversight Committee to launch its own investigation into the team, Snyder, and even the NFL.

That investigation has led to more allegations of sexual harassment. Specifically, former team employee Tiffani Johnston testified in February that Snyder grabbed her thigh at a team dinner and pressured her to get into a limousine – claims that Snyder has since denied.

Johnston's testimony triggered a new league investigation that's currently being led by Mary Jo White, a former US attorney and chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Attorneys representing some of the former Commanders employees who have filed complaints against the team responded to Wednesday's news with a statement.

'Today's news that Dan and Tanya Snyder are exploring selling the Washington Commanders is a good development for the team, its former and current employees, and its many fans,' said attorneys Lisa Banks and Debra Katz. 'We will have to see how this unfolds, but this could obviously be a big step towards healing and closure for the many brave women and men who came forward.'"

The report stated that it could be for the entire team or a minority stake. Shortly after the Forbes story broke, the Commanders released a statement confirming the story.

What does this mean? At this point, no one really knows except the Snyder family.

But that hasn’t stopped at least one potential buyer from preparing to make a run at the Commanders.

Media mogul Byron Allen, the founder, owner and CEO of Entertainment Studios, also known as the Allen Media Group, is preparing a bid for the Commanders, according to Kamaron Leach of Bloomberg.

Per Leach, Allen is working with an investor group. If he follows through with a bid on the Commanders, it would be his second bid at NFL ownership this year. Allen placed a bid on the Denver Broncos earlier this year, but Denver’s bid was won by a group led by Robert Walton of the Walmart fortune for $4.65 billion.

A bid for Washington is expected to cost significantly more.

Allen has been a successful stand-up comedian, television producer and media executive. The 61-year-old Allen was born in Detroit and grew up in Los Angeles."

The source says that Bezos, 58, is ""looking into buying the Washington Commanders"" after current owners Dan and Tanya Snyder announced they were exploring options to sell the NFL team on Wednesday.

Bezos is considering making the purchase ""possibly in partnership"" with Jay-Z, according to the insider. The rapper previously owned a stake in the Brooklyn Nets.

The Amazon founder's interest in purchasing an NFL team dates back to 2019 when CBS Sports reported that Bezos had expressed interest in becoming an owner in the league. Sources told the outlet that Bezos ""has strong support within the league to eventually join their ranks,"" but at the time, no teams were for sale.

Now though, the Commanders could be available. The Snyders appears to be entertaining the idea of selling — or adding a minority owner to — the team after 23 years of ownershi, according to a statement shared with PEOPLE on Wednesday. The Commanders stated that the Snyders ""have hired BofA [Bank of America] Securities to consider potential transactions.""

Even though the statement didn't explicitly state the team was going to sell, as The Wall Street Journal reported, hiring a bank is a common first step in the process.

When asked by PEOPLE what buying options the team was entertaining, a team spokesperson said, ""We are exploring all options.""

Dan, 57, and Tanya, 60, have already had at least four phone calls with parties interested in purchasing the team, according to Forbes.

New ownership, under Bezos or otherwise, would save the franchise from a possible ""ousting"" of the Snyders, who have been under fire several times for accusations of workplace misconduct.

75ddd415-1c32-4e80-a145-425af8cf77a7,"TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares were mostly higher Wednesday ahead of a decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve on an interest rate increase to curb inflation.

Oil prices rose more than $1 a barrel and U.S. futures were also higher. Stocks ended lower on Wall Street after an unexpectedly strong report on the job market raised concerns the Fed will keep the pressure on inflation with big rate increases.

Chinese benchmarks extended gains after strong advances a day earlier driven by speculation the government might be preparing to gradually relax stringent COVID-19 restrictions. Since that was not followed by any official confirmation, the enthusiasm could quickly fade.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.6% to 15,554.91 while the Shanghai Composite index added 0.5% to 2,983.76.

Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 was up less than 0.1% at 27,685.42. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 added 0.3% to 6,999.90. South Korea’s Kospi was up less than 0.1% at 2,336.44, erasing gains that came earlier in the morning.

South Korea’s export growth fell in October as demand from China fell. But the Bank of Korea’s minutes for a policy meeting last month showed a “hawkish theme of bringing inflation under control against dovish surprise by two dissents,” according to the Bank of America.

“Sentiments in the Asia session could largely hold on to some wait-and-see as well, but eyes will remain on Chinese equities after its stellar performance yesterday,” said Yeap Jun Rong, market strategist at IG in Singapore.

The Fed is beginning a two-day policy meeting Wednesday that’s expected to yield its sixth interest rate increase of the year as the central bank fights the worst inflation in four decades. The widespread expectation is for the Fed to push through another increase that’s triple the usual size, or three-quarters of a percentage point.

The S&P 500 fell 0.4% to 3,856.10 after having been up as much as 1% shortly after trading opened. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2% to 32,653.20 and the Nasdaq composite dropped 0.9%, to 10,890.85. The Russell 2000 rose 0.3% to 1,851.39.

Big technology stocks were the biggest weights on the market. Their big valuations give them more heft in pushing the broader market up or down. Also, rising interest rates tend to make the sector look less attractive because of those high valuations. Apple fell 1.8%.

Communication services stocks, retailers and other companies that rely on consumer spending also helped drag down the overall S&P 500, keeping gains in banks, energy firms and other sectors of the market in check.

The Labor Department reported that U.S. job openings rose unexpectedly in September, suggesting the labor market is not cooling as fast as the Fed hoped for as it tries to slow economic growth.

“That really fuels the expectation that the Fed has to do more hiking,” said Jason Draho, head of asset allocation for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management. “The labor market is still too tight for the Fed.”

Long-term Treasury yields turned higher after the report in job openings came out and rose back near multiyear highs. Those high rates have helped push mortgage rates above 7% this year.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.05% from 3.93% earlier in the morning. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which tends to reflect market expectations of future moves by the Fed, rose to 4.54% from 4.40%.

“The issue for investors is figuring out how long the hiking cycle will last,” Draho said. “(Fed Chair Jerome) Powell will want to leave all options on the table.”

Earnings remain a big focus for investors this week. Starbucks and Warner Bros. Discovery report earnings on Thursday and Cardinal Health does so on Friday.

TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares were mostly higher Wednesday ahead of a decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve on an interest rate increase to curb inflation.

Oil prices rose more than $1 a barrel and U.S. futures were also higher. Stocks ended lower on Wall Street after an unexpectedly strong report on the job market raised concerns the Fed will keep the pressure on inflation with big rate increases.

Chinese benchmarks extended gains after strong advances a day earlier driven by speculation the government might be preparing to gradually relax stringent COVID-19 restrictions. Since that was not followed by any official confirmation, the enthusiasm could quickly fade.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.6% to 15,554.91 while the Shanghai Composite index added 0.5% to 2,983.76.

Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 was up less than 0.1% at 27,685.42. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 added 0.3% to 6,999.90. South Korea’s Kospi was up less than 0.1% at 2,336.44, erasing gains that came earlier in the morning.

South Korea’s export growth fell in October as demand from China fell. But the Bank of Korea’s minutes for a policy meeting last month showed a “hawkish theme of bringing inflation under control against dovish surprise by two dissents,” according to the Bank of America.

“Sentiments in the Asia session could largely hold on to some wait-and-see as well, but eyes will remain on Chinese equities after its stellar performance yesterday,” said Yeap Jun Rong, market strategist at IG in Singapore.

The Fed is beginning a two-day policy meeting Wednesday that’s expected to yield its sixth interest rate increase of the year as the central bank fights the worst inflation in four decades. The widespread expectation is for the Fed to push through another increase that’s triple the usual size, or three-quarters of a percentage point.

The S&P 500 fell 0.4% to 3,856.10 after having been up as much as 1% shortly after trading opened. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2% to 32,653.20 and the Nasdaq composite dropped 0.9%, to 10,890.85. The Russell 2000 rose 0.3% to 1,851.39.

Big technology stocks were the biggest weights on the market. Their big valuations give them more heft in pushing the broader market up or down. Also, rising interest rates tend to make the sector look less attractive because of those high valuations. Apple fell 1.8%.

Communication services stocks, retailers and other companies that rely on consumer spending also helped drag down the overall S&P 500, keeping gains in banks, energy firms and other sectors of the market in check.

The Labor Department reported that U.S. job openings rose unexpectedly in September, suggesting the labor market is not cooling as fast as the Fed hoped for as it tries to slow economic growth.

“That really fuels the expectation that the Fed has to do more hiking,” said Jason Draho, head of asset allocation for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management. “The labor market is still too tight for the Fed.”

Long-term Treasury yields turned higher after the report in job openings came out and rose back near multiyear highs. Those high rates have helped push mortgage rates above 7% this year.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.05% from 3.93% earlier in the morning. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which tends to reflect market expectations of future moves by the Fed, rose to 4.54% from 4.40%.

“The issue for investors is figuring out how long the hiking cycle will last,” Draho said. “(Fed Chair Jerome) Powell will want to leave all options on the table.”

By Caroline Valetkevitch

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks fell on Tuesday while Treasury yields dipped as investors speculated whether the U.S. Federal Reserve may hint at a slower pace of policy tightening this week.

Data showing U.S. job openings unexpectedly rose in September and suggesting that demand for labor remains strong supported the view that the Fed will continue with its aggressive interest rate hikes.

The Fed is expected to raise interest rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday after its two-day meeting, but investors will look for any signals that the U.S. central bank may be considering slowing the pace of rate hikes in the future.

""With the Fed tomorrow, it's more about the comments following the rate hike,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. ""The question is: Do they start to turn dovish? Do they start to pinpoint their plan to pivot? Will they suggest they could do 50 (basis points) in December and will be done in early 2023?""

""The market is down today based on a little nervousness that the Fed is going to be a broken record tomorrow, and that it's going to be cautious at all cost.""

Although last week's ECB meeting was perceived by markets as containing dovish signals, ECB President Christine Lagarde said in an interview on Tuesday that the central bank must keep raising rates to fight off inflation, even if the probability of a euro zone recession has increased.

The Bank of England (BoE) is also meeting this week and is expected to deliver a 75 basis points increase as well. Traders then expect the BoE to slow down and raise rates by 50 basis points in December.

In U.S. equity markets, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 79.75 points, or 0.24%, to 32,653.2, the S&P 500 lost 15.88 points, or 0.41%, to 3,856.1 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 97.30 points, or 0.89%, to 10,890.85.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.58% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.19%.

British energy giant BP reported a third quarter profit of $8.15 billion, more than double its earnings in the same period last year. Rivals Shell, Exxon Mobil and TotalEnergies also reported bumper profits last week.

The yield on 10-year notes fell 2.7 basis points to 4.05%, while the two-year yield, which typically moves in step with rate expectations, was up 4.4 basis points to yield 4.5447%.

In currencies, the dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against six rivals, was up very slightly.

The Chinese yuan fell to a near 15-year low against the dollar, before paring its losses after the central bank fixed the official guidance rate on the weaker side of the key 7.2-per-dollar level for the first time since 2008. The dollar was last down 0.4% against the offshore yuan.

The Australian dollar was little changed at US$0.6395.. The Reserve Bank of Australia raised rates by 25 basis points for a second month running, but revised its inflation outlook upward and said more rate hikes would be needed.

In commodities, oil recouped losses from the previous session, on optimism that China, the world's second-largest oil consumer, could reopen from strict COVID-19 curbs. U.S. crude oil futures settled at $88.37 per barrel, up $1.84, or 2.13% while Brent crude futures settled at $94.65, up $1.84, or 1.98%.

Summary Companies U.S. stocks end lower; Powell comments trigger market reversal

Dollar down vs Japan's yen

Fed delivers 75 bps hike as expected















NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended a volatile session lower while Treasury yields were up Wednesday as the U.S. Federal Reserve delivered a three-quarters of a percentage point interest rate hike and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said it was too soon to speculate over a pause in rate hikes.

The dollar was down against the Japanese yen, but well off its earlier lows.

Stocks initially jumped and yields extended declines after the U.S. central bank announced the rate hike as expected, and signaled that future increases in borrowing costs could be made in smaller steps. read more

But markets sharply reversed course after Powell, in remarks during a news conference after the announcement, said ""it is very premature to be thinking about pausing"" on the effort to lift the federal funds target rate.

""The (stock) market's response was positive until the press conference,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Powell ""didn't waver in his commitment towards restoring price stability, and obviously the market was not pleased with that,"" she said.

The Fed has been aggressively raising rates in order to bring down inflation, and investors have been speculating over when it could get less aggressive in its tightening cycle.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 505.44 points, or 1.55%, to 32,147.76, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 96.41 points, or 2.50%, to 3,759.69 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 366.05 points, or 3.36%, to 10,524.80.

MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe (.MIWD00000PUS) shed 1.72%.

After their initial decline, benchmark 10-year notes last were up 3.2 basis points to 4.084%, from 4.052% late on Tuesday.

U.S. two-year yields, which reflect rate expectations, were up 6.6 bps at 4.603% .

In currencies, the dollar intially fell sharply and was down more than 1% against the Japanese yen following the Fed announcement. The dollar was last down 0.3% at 147.76 yen.

The euro was down 0.55% to $0.982.

Oil prices ended higher, climbing further after the Fed's rate news. read more

Brent crude settled up $1.51, or 1.6%, to $96.16 while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude settled up $1.63, or 1.8%, to $90.

HONG KONG -- Chinese regulators downplayed China’s real estate slump and slowing economic growth while Hong Kong's top leader pitched Hong Kong as a unique link to the rest of China at a high-profile investment summit Wednesday.

About 200 global financial executives gathered to network and discuss issues such as global risks and sustainable finance at Hong Kong’s first major conference since the city lifted COVID-19 quarantine restrictions.

Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, urged those attending to visit China to understand what is happening in the country and urged them not to “bet against” China and Hong Kong.

International media “don’t really understand China very well” and have a “short-term focus,” he said, drawing laughter and applause from the audience.

Fang and other Chinese officials addressed the conference in prerecorded interviews — travel to and from mainland China is constrained by strict quarantine requirements.

China's central bank governor, Yi Gang, said that inflation remains subdued, at under 3% compared with 8% or more in many Western economies, and the country's economic and reform policies will continue. Such comments appeared to be meant to counter worries that flared following a Communist Party congress last month, where leader Xi Jinping was awarded an unprecedented third five-year term and key reformers were excluded from top ruling party leadership.

“China has a super large market, as there is still much room for urbanization and the demand of middle class consumers is still on the rise,” said Yi.

China’s economy grew at a 3.9% annual pace in the last quarter compared to a year earlier, well below an official target of more than 5%, and the vital real estate sector has languished as regulators have sought to curb debt mounting toward unsustainable levels.

Xiao Yuanqi, vice chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, sought to reassure those attending the conference, saying property loans make up just 26% banks' total lending and 90% of property loans were “good quality.”

Shares in both Hong Kong and Shanghai surged Wednesday, with the Hang Seng gaining 2.4% while the Shanghai Composite index climbed 1.2%.

The speakers lineup at the Hong Kong conference includes Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon and other leading executives from institutions such as Citigroup and Blackstone.

It is designed to highlight the former British colony's role as an attractive and competitive financial hub.

The city remains the “only place in the world where the global advantage and the China advantage come together in a single city,” Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee said in opening the event.

“This unique convergence makes Hong Kong the irreplaceable connection between the mainland and the rest of the world as the center of economic gravity in the world shifts eastward,” he said.

The British handed control of Hong Kong to China in 1997 with the understanding that Beijing would allow the tiny territory autonomy in its legal system and economic policies for at least 50 years. In recent years Beijing has been expanding its influence. Such efforts gained momentum after mass protests in 2019 demanding a more democratic system of leadership, culminating in the implementation of a security law designed to quash dissent.

Combined with strict quarantine controls and a sharp downturn in tourism, that has compounded the economic impact from the pandemic.

Lee said the “worst is behind” Hong Kong. A former security chief, he told the conference “law and order has returned"" and social disturbances were in the past.

Organizers pushed ahead with the long-planned conference despite tropical storm warnings that led authorities to close schools.

As tropical storm Nalgae drew closer to the city, the Hong Kong Observatory said that it would raise its T8 signal in the afternoon, which would effectively shut down the city and stop trading on the stock market.

Hong Kong pulled out all the stops for the financial conference, adjusting COVID-19 restrictions to allow participants to dine in at specific restaurants. Most other inbound travelers are banned from doing so for three days after they arrive in the city.

Attendees who test positive for COVID-19 are allowed to leave by chartered flights if they want to, instead of having to be isolated for at least seven days in Hong Kong.

Some U.S. lawmakers have urged American companies not to participate in the meeting given tensions with China over trade and human rights. The U.S. has been vocal about Hong Kong's crackdown on dissent following implementation of the National Security Law."

Hong Kong leader John Lee sought to drum up confidence in the city’s future as a global financial hub on Wednesday, as he welcomed some of Wall Street’s top executives to its biggest international event in years.

Speaking at an investment summit that has attracted more than 200 participants from 20 countries, the city’s chief executive said that it was “opening once again” for international business after more than two and a half years of arduous pandemic restrictions.

As he addressed some of the executives in attendance, including Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon, Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO James Gorman, UBS (UBS) chairman Colm Kelleher, HSBC (HSBC) CEO Noel Quinn and Standard Chartered (SCBFF) CEO Bill Winters, the government leader was insistent in reaffirming his intention to keep the former British colony competitive for global finance.

“We were, we are and we will remain one of the world’s leading financial centers,” Lee vowed. “You can take that to the bank.”

Lee also sought to reassure executives that Hong Kong would maintain a distinct role to that of mainland China, saying that central government officials had outlined their support for the city retaining its unique position as a gateway between East and West.

China’s latest five-year plan includes goals to reinforce the city’s role as an international trade, financial, shipping and aviation center, Lee said. “The worst is behind us.”

Solomon, Gorman and Kelleher, who took to the stage for a panel shortly after Lee’s remarks, did not comment directly on the city’s reopening. But Kelleher noted that “whilst we’re all very pro-China,” the bank was “waiting for zero-Covid to open up in China and see what will happen.”

In September, Hong Kong lifted quarantine requirements that had largely isolated the city, choked economic activity, and fueled a historic brain drain. Mainland China, however, still has a mandate in place for most inbound travelers to self-isolate for at least seven days, under its stringent “zero-Covid policy.”

That contrast was highlighted Wednesday as mainland Chinese officials — including People’s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang — addressed the conference in pre-recorded video remarks, rather than attending in person.

Hong Kong’s economy is heavily reliant on financial services. In 2020, the sector contributed $76 billion — approximately 23% of its GDP, Lee said.

In an interview with CNN Business, DBS Hong Kong CEO Sebastian Paredes called the show of support from the city’s top brass “a tangible demonstration that Hong Kong is back.”

“The people that have flown into Hong Kong — the global CEOs of insurance firms and private equity companies and banks and the rest — demonstrate that Hong Kong is a very important international financial center,” he said.

“We’ve been closed for too long,” he added, noting that some restrictions remain, including controls on the border with mainland China. “But as we progress, at least we are opening internationally,” said Paredes. “We are hopeful.”"

HONG KONG -- A tropical storm and absences of VIP guests have cast a shadow over a financial conference meant to help Hong Kong restore its image as a financial hub and destination for business travel.

The first major conference since the city lifted COVID-19 quarantine restrictions was due to begin Wednesday. But at least four top executives from institutions including the CEOs of Citigroup and Barclays, who had been expected to attend the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, were dropping out.

The Hong Kong Observatory forecast that tropical storm Nalgae would likely bring torrential rains as it passes 200 kilometers (120 miles) to the southwest, in further bad news for organizers of the meeting.

At least four top finance executives initially slated to attend the conference this week have dropped out. They include Blackstone Inc. President Jonathan Gray and Citigroup Inc.’s CEO Jane Fraser, who will no longer attend the conference after contracting COVID-19. The CEO of Barclays, C.S. Venkatakrishnan, also scrapped plans to go. Gray was slated to speak in a panel on global uncertainty, while Fraser was supposed to discuss sustainable finance.

On Tuesday, Capital Group Cos.’ CEO Timothy Armour became the latest chief executive to withdraw from the conference, for health reasons.

The city’s T3 strong wind signal was in force Tuesday, with the possibility a higher signal might be raised, depending on the storm. Typically, most businesses close and events are postponed if a T8 strong wind signal is raised. But the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, organizer of the summit, said it would go ahead even if the T8 signal is hoisted.

The main events of the conference take place Wednesday.

Authorities have pulled out all the stops for the gathering, tailoring restrictions for participants such as allowing them to dine in at specific restaurants, even as most other inbound travelers are banned from doing so for three days after they arrive in the city.

Other restrictions include allowing attendees who test positive for COVID-19 to leave by chartered flights if they want to, instead of having to be isolated for at least seven days in Hong Kong.

Hong Kong leader John Lee said during a news conference Tuesday that it was to be a “vibrant” week for Hong Kong.

When asked if the restrictions designed for conference participants constituted a “double standard,” Lee said different plans are formulated to ensure activities can go ahead.

“It’s on these principles that we put in place certain measures so that some major events can go ahead in Hong Kong,” he said.

Illustrating the impatience in Hong Kong for a reopening on the neighboring Chinese mainland, the city's benchmark Hang Seng index jumped 5.2% on Tuesday following unconfirmed rumors that China may be beginning to plan to dismantle its stringent COVID-19 controls, which involve mass testing and sometimes lock-downs of entire neighborhoods or cities.

A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, told reporters he was “not aware of what you just mentioned” when asked about the rumor.

Some U.S. lawmakers have urged American companies not to participate in the meeting given tensions with China over trade and human rights. The U.S. has been vocal about a crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong after the semi-autonomous territory implemented its National Security Law.

Sen. Jeff Merkley and Rep. Jim McGovern, who chair the Congressional Executive Commission on China, urged financial executives to reconsider their decision to attend the Hong Kong event.

“Their presence only serves to legitimize the swift dismantling of Hong Kong’s autonomy, free press, and the rule of law by Hong Kong authorities acting along with the Chinese Communist Party,” they said in a statement.

After loosening its once strict pandemic precautions, Hong Kong is trying to get back on track as a destination for all kinds of tourism.

The former British colony is due to hold the Hong Kong Sevens rugby tournament from Nov. 4-6, for the first since the pandemic began. The city's is also holding a five-day “FinTech Week,"" with hundreds of exhibitors and speakers and an expected total turnout of thousands."
8477740d-25e7-48cc-8d36-a6dd84134fb6,"HONG KONG — After mass unrest in 2019, a pandemic that left it isolated from the world and the imposition of a national security law that has crushed dissent, Hong Kong is ready to turn the page.

“Social disturbance is clearly in the past,” the city’s leader, John Lee, said Wednesday at the Four Seasons Hotel, where about 200 finance industry executives from around the world were gathered for a summit. “It has given way to stability, to growing business and community confidence in Hong Kong’s future. Law and order has returned; the worst is behind us.”

But the summit — meant to signal that the Chinese territory long known as a regional financial powerhouse is again open for business — has been shadowed by some awkward realities.

Hong Kong’s border with mainland China, its main economic driver, remains tightly closed because of pandemic restrictions. Participants in the summit, many of them American companies, have been criticized by rights groups and lawmakers who say they are complicit in China’s harsh crackdown on pro-democracy figures and groups. And as the subject of U.S. sanctions himself, Lee is unable to hold an account with many of the very banks he was addressing.

None of that seems to have dampened the mood at this week’s events, which started on Monday with a fintech conference and conclude this weekend with the return of a major international sporting event, the Rugby Sevens tournament.

Iñaki Amate, chairman of the European Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, was upbeat about the event and the pro-business atmosphere he encountered.

“I have to say how positively surprised I was to see that there was a very good vibe,” Amate said Tuesday as he headed for a tour and welcome dinner at the M+ art museum. “It felt like people came out of a cave with a lot of energy and willing to start doing business again.”

The summit is part of a broader campaign to draw both business and tourists back to Hong Kong, an international financial center of 7.3 million that built its reputation as a travel hub and a bastion of freedom in Asia. That image has been tarnished by strict Covid restrictions and the national security law, both cited as reasons for leaving in a mass exodus of residents and expatriates.

Despite official efforts, not many people are coming to replace those who have left. According to government statistics, about 319,000 people arrived in Hong Kong last month, down 97% from 10.8 million in October 2019. Companies have reported difficulties recruiting and retaining talent.

And even as Hong Kong eases Covid restrictions, bad news keeps coming. The economy shrank 4.5% in the third quarter, extending a recession. Airlines are pulling out of the city, once a global aviation hub. According to a report in September, Hong Kong has lost its status as Asia’s top financial center to Singapore.

There are also daily court developments stemming from the 2019 anti-government protests, in which more than 10,000 people have been arrested. In the last two months alone, Hong Kong has put a 90-year-old Roman Catholic cleric on trial over a legal aid fund for protesters; jailed five speech therapists over “seditious” children’s books; jailed two people for sedition after they clapped to support defendants in court; and convicted the democracy activist Jimmy Lai on fraud charges that the United States condemned as “spurious.”

More than 200 people, including Lai, have also been arrested under the national security law that Beijing imposed in 2020 in response to the protests. The U.S. has spoken out repeatedly against the law, which criminalized subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces. Hong Kong and Chinese officials say it was necessary to restore stability.

While it may not be realistic to expect businesses to turn away from China’s huge market, global business leaders “need to recognize that there’s a new situation in Hong Kong, there’s a new reality,” said Brian Kern, the lead researcher for a report on doing business in Hong Kong that was published last month by the Hong Kong Democracy Council, a nonprofit group based in Washington.

The group’s website appears to have been blocked in Hong Kong since shortly after the report’s release.

Businesses “need to develop policies and guidelines and due diligence processes so as to guard against perhaps inadvertently doing things that are against the U.N. principles on business and human rights,” Kern said.

Officials have indeed seized on the summit as a public relations win for Hong Kong. An article in the Chinese state-backed nationalist tabloid Global Times on Thursday said the gathering “served as a strong rebuttal to the hype and bad-mouthing of the city’s status.”

Hong Kong is “not going anywhere” as an international financial center, said Allan Zeman, chairman of the Lan Kwai Fong Group, a Hong Kong-based real estate developer.

“If you’re an international bank, you cannot exclude China from your mix,” he said.

Zeman is among the business leaders who welcomed the national security law after the protests of 2019, which disrupted transportation and sometimes turned violent.

“Business likes stability,” he said. “Business is not about politics.”

Kern argued that businesses that assert the national security law isn’t meant for them are “playing a bit of a dangerous game.”

“I think that everybody in Hong Kong needs to worry about it and ask themselves what their relationship is to it and assess the risks involved,” he said.

Last week, Hong Kong fell out of the top 20 in a global rule of law index compiled by the U.S.-based nonprofit World Justice Project, which cited the national security law. Officials countered that Hong Kong is still ranked higher than some Western countries, and that it ranked sixth for order and security.

Lee said Hong Kong still had strong rule of law and an independent judiciary, emphasizing the “one country, two systems” principle of governance under which Hong Kong, a former British colony, returned to Chinese rule in 1997.

“Hong Kong remains the only place in the world where the global advantage and the China advantage come together in a single city,” he said.

Lee also pointed to a report in September in which Hong Kong topped Singapore as the world’s freest economy. But the Fraser Institute, the Canadian think tank that produced the report, noted that Hong Kong’s overall rating had fallen and said its ranking was based on 2020 data and did not reflect “more recent interference from China.”

Lingering Covid restrictions

While keeping relatively quiet on the national security law, businesses have been much more vocal about the Covid restrictions and given Lee credit for easing them. Many in Hong Kong breathed a sigh of relief in September, when Lee announced an end to mandatory hotel quarantine for overseas arrivals that at one point extended to 21 days.

“We’re starting to see more common sense” in the way the government balances Covid prevention with economic concerns, Amate said.

But other restrictions linger, including a vaccine pass to enter bars and restaurants and compulsory mask wearing even outdoors. Though overseas arrivals no longer have to quarantine, they are prohibited from visiting bars and restaurants for the first three days, and those who test positive for the virus may still be sent to government quarantine facilities.

Officials have relaxed some of these rules for the summit attendees, allowing them to visit private dining rooms and leave immediately on their own private jets if they test positive. Hong Kong’s financial secretary, Paul Chan, was allowed to attend the summit this week despite testing positive for the virus upon his return from Saudi Arabia, as officials considered him a “recovered case.”

Even Hong Kong’s biggest optimists concede there is a lot of work to be done, namely reopening the border with mainland China.

“As long as we remove the travel restrictions, business and leisure travelers are going to come back,” said Heiwai Tang, an economics professor at the University of Hong Kong, “and then we’ll be back to normal I would say very quickly.”"

HONG KONG — Hong Kong’s first major financial summit since the start of the pandemic just concluded with rousing declarations that the “worst is behind us” and that the city is still the most important business center in Asia. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight Yet the messages rang somewhat hollow, despite the presence of more than 200 international leaders, who were exempted from some of the pandemic restrictions that local residents still face.

Hong Kong had remained largely closed since the coronavirus hit in early 2020, hewing closely to mainland China’s severe “zero covid” policy and requiring mandatory quarantine for travelers. Combined with the democracy protests and security crackdown that shook the city the previous year, the impact was devastating. The once-thriving financial center became further isolated, its economy pummeled. The labor force continued to shrink as an exodus of residents accelerated.

The three-day Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, hosted by the city’s Monetary Authority, was intended to signal Hong Kong’s comeback as an international powerhouse. It drew top officials from 120 financial institutions around the world, including Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan and Blackstone.

In an opening speech in a ballroom at the Four Seasons Hotel, one of the region’s most luxurious venues, Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee told executives and bankers that the city is resilient and “bounces back, better than ever.”

“Opportunity and timing are right here, right now, in Hong Kong,” said Lee, a Beijing loyalist who took office in July. “Go for it. Get in front, not behind.”

Fang Xinghai, vice chairperson of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, urged those gathered not to “bet against China and Hong Kong” and “not to read too much international reports about China, which don’t understand China and only focuses on the short term.”

But the summit couldn’t escape controversy. At least four top executives pulled out beforehand, citing coronavirus infections or schedule changes. Financial Secretary Paul Chan attended despite later confirming that he had tested positive, with a “low viral load,” after returning from a Middle East business trip. Officials denied that he had received any special treatment.

Visiting executives were exempted from the restaurant bans and medical monitoring that people arriving in Hong Kong typically must comply with until they receive a negative PCR test result. Any bankers with confirmed covid were allowed to leave on a private jet.

While “the summit is a good start” for the city’s resurgence, economist Gary Ng of Natixis noted that the discussions didn’t address concrete plans for further easing pandemic policies. Follow-up action on lifting the restrictions is “the most important,” he said.

Chinese officials and bankers addressed issues related to the country’s uncertain economic forecast, said Laurence Li, chairman of the Financial Services Development Council. “There was no feeling of an elephant in the room,” he said, adding that most attendees were more interested in global inflation and exchange rate risks, as well as economic upturn and downturn cycles.

Zhiwu Chen, a finance professor at the University of Hong Kong, said the summit was a show where officials tried to put Hong Kong in the best light. The government, he suggested, should instead be prioritizing deregulation and freer markets to restore the city’s international financial luster, with “true rule of law” and speech and press freedoms.

Some U.S. lawmakers had urged American bankers not to participate to avoid legitimizing China’s crackdown on pro-democracy activists. There was no formal discussion during the summit of Hong Kong’s declining rule of law under Chinese control.

To Hong Kong citizens like Owen Ng, everything about the summit seemed remote, if not irrelevant.

Ng, who is 27 and works in marketing, said the messages about Hong Kong’s resurgence sound “a bit ridiculous” given most people’s reality — lower living quality, inflated prices and coronavirus policies that have been relaxed “very minimally.”

“It feels distant and unrelated to me,” Ng said Friday. “How positive can it be when the policies they are maintaining are not in sync with the world trend?”

Major lenders Standard Chartered and HSBC expect Hong Kong and China's economy to rebound, even as Beijing continues to ramp up its Covid measures and Hong Kong's economy posted its worst quarter in more than two years. Their comments come as China imposed fresh lockdowns in Guangzhou, Wuhan and Xining last week. ""Hong Kong business is as strong as it has ever been,"" said StanChart's CEO Bill Winters. ""We had record results in Hong Kong in the third quarter of this year, which seems incongruous with the ongoing, lingering Covid type restrictions and the challenges in China."" Both banking powerhouses also posted their earnings recently.

I have every confidence Hong Kong will rebound strongly next year. Noel Quinn CEO, HSBC

Hong Kong's third-quarter GDP dropped 4.5% compared to a year before. StanChart recorded a 40% increase in quarterly profit in the three months to September, beating expectations. It also revised its income growth expectations from a forecast of 10% to 13%. Winters attributed the stellar results to higher interest rates and recovering market climates.

""I think only about half the growth we've had ... was coming from interest rates. The other half is coming from the fact that the markets where we operate are kicking back fully into gear, including Hong Kong and interestingly China as well,"" he told CNBC. HSBC's CEO Noel Quinn echoed similar optimism over Hong Kong. ""I think Hong Kong will rebound strongly following Covid ... I have every confidence Hong Kong will rebound strongly next year,"" Quinn said, adding that it was understandable that the economy would slow due to the lockdowns."

HONG KONG -- Chinese regulators downplayed China’s real estate slump and slowing economic growth while Hong Kong's top leader pitched Hong Kong as a unique link to the rest of China at a high-profile investment summit Wednesday.

About 200 global financial executives gathered to network and discuss issues such as global risks and sustainable finance at Hong Kong’s first major conference since the city lifted COVID-19 quarantine restrictions.

Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, urged those attending to visit China to understand what is happening in the country and urged them not to “bet against” China and Hong Kong.

International media “don’t really understand China very well” and have a “short-term focus,” he said, drawing laughter and applause from the audience.

Fang and other Chinese officials addressed the conference in prerecorded interviews — travel to and from mainland China is constrained by strict quarantine requirements.

China's central bank governor, Yi Gang, said that inflation remains subdued, at under 3% compared with 8% or more in many Western economies, and the country's economic and reform policies will continue. Such comments appeared to be meant to counter worries that flared following a Communist Party congress last month, where leader Xi Jinping was awarded an unprecedented third five-year term and key reformers were excluded from top ruling party leadership.

“China has a super large market, as there is still much room for urbanization and the demand of middle class consumers is still on the rise,” said Yi.

China’s economy grew at a 3.9% annual pace in the last quarter compared to a year earlier, well below an official target of more than 5%, and the vital real estate sector has languished as regulators have sought to curb debt mounting toward unsustainable levels.

Xiao Yuanqi, vice chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, sought to reassure those attending the conference, saying property loans make up just 26% banks' total lending and 90% of property loans were “good quality.”

Shares in both Hong Kong and Shanghai surged Wednesday, with the Hang Seng gaining 2.4% while the Shanghai Composite index climbed 1.2%.

The speakers lineup at the Hong Kong conference includes Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon and other leading executives from institutions such as Citigroup and Blackstone.

It is designed to highlight the former British colony's role as an attractive and competitive financial hub.

The city remains the “only place in the world where the global advantage and the China advantage come together in a single city,” Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee said in opening the event.

“This unique convergence makes Hong Kong the irreplaceable connection between the mainland and the rest of the world as the center of economic gravity in the world shifts eastward,” he said.

The British handed control of Hong Kong to China in 1997 with the understanding that Beijing would allow the tiny territory autonomy in its legal system and economic policies for at least 50 years. In recent years Beijing has been expanding its influence. Such efforts gained momentum after mass protests in 2019 demanding a more democratic system of leadership, culminating in the implementation of a security law designed to quash dissent.

Combined with strict quarantine controls and a sharp downturn in tourism, that has compounded the economic impact from the pandemic.

Lee said the “worst is behind” Hong Kong. A former security chief, he told the conference “law and order has returned"" and social disturbances were in the past.

Organizers pushed ahead with the long-planned conference despite tropical storm warnings that led authorities to close schools.

As tropical storm Nalgae drew closer to the city, the Hong Kong Observatory said that it would raise its T8 signal in the afternoon, which would effectively shut down the city and stop trading on the stock market.

Hong Kong pulled out all the stops for the financial conference, adjusting COVID-19 restrictions to allow participants to dine in at specific restaurants. Most other inbound travelers are banned from doing so for three days after they arrive in the city.

Attendees who test positive for COVID-19 are allowed to leave by chartered flights if they want to, instead of having to be isolated for at least seven days in Hong Kong.

Some U.S. lawmakers have urged American companies not to participate in the meeting given tensions with China over trade and human rights. The U.S. has been vocal about Hong Kong's crackdown on dissent following implementation of the National Security Law."

The first major conference since the city lifted COVID-19 quarantine restrictions was due to begin Wednesday. But at least four top executives from institutions including the CEOs of Citigroup and Barclays, who had been expected to attend the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, were dropping out.

The Hong Kong Observatory forecast that tropical storm Nalgae would likely bring torrential rains as it passes 200 kilometers (120 miles) to the southwest, in further bad news for organizers of the meeting.

At least four top finance executives initially slated to attend the conference this week have dropped out. They include Blackstone Inc. President Jonathan Gray and Citigroup Inc.’s CEO Jane Fraser, who will no longer attend the conference after contracting COVID-19. The CEO of Barclays, C.S. Venkatakrishnan, also scrapped plans to go. Gray was slated to speak in a panel on global uncertainty, while Fraser was supposed to discuss sustainable finance.

On Tuesday, Capital Group Cos.’ CEO Timothy Armour became the latest chief executive to withdraw from the conference, for health reasons.

The city’s T3 strong wind signal was in force Tuesday, with the possibility a higher signal might be raised, depending on the storm. Typically, most businesses close and events are postponed if a T8 strong wind signal is raised. But the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, organizer of the summit, said it would go ahead even if the T8 signal is hoisted.

The main events of the conference take place Wednesday.

Authorities have pulled out all the stops for the gathering, tailoring restrictions for participants such as allowing them to dine in at specific restaurants, even as most other inbound travelers are banned from doing so for three days after they arrive in the city.

Other restrictions include allowing attendees who test positive for COVID-19 to leave by chartered flights if they want to, instead of having to be isolated for at least seven days in Hong Kong.

Hong Kong leader John Lee said during a news conference Tuesday that it was to be a “vibrant” week for Hong Kong.

When asked if the restrictions designed for conference participants constituted a “double standard,” Lee said different plans are formulated to ensure activities can go ahead.

“It’s on these principles that we put in place certain measures so that some major events can go ahead in Hong Kong,” he said.

Illustrating the impatience in Hong Kong for a reopening on the neighboring Chinese mainland, the city's benchmark Hang Seng index jumped 5.2% on Tuesday following unconfirmed rumors that China may be beginning to plan to dismantle its stringent COVID-19 controls, which involve mass testing and sometimes lock-downs of entire neighborhoods or cities.

A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, told reporters he was “not aware of what you just mentioned” when asked about the rumor.

Some U.S. lawmakers have urged American companies not to participate in the meeting given tensions with China over trade and human rights. The U.S. has been vocal about a crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong after the semi-autonomous territory implemented its National Security Law.

Sen. Jeff Merkley and Rep. Jim McGovern, who chair the Congressional Executive Commission on China, urged financial executives to reconsider their decision to attend the Hong Kong event.

“Their presence only serves to legitimize the swift dismantling of Hong Kong’s autonomy, free press, and the rule of law by Hong Kong authorities acting along with the Chinese Communist Party,” they said in a statement.

After loosening its once strict pandemic precautions, Hong Kong is trying to get back on track as a destination for all kinds of tourism.

The former British colony is due to hold the Hong Kong Sevens rugby tournament from Nov. 4-6, for the first since the pandemic began. The city's is also holding a five-day “FinTech Week,"" with hundreds of exhibitors and speakers and an expected total turnout of thousands."

Asia’s two financial centers are looking more attractive to banks right now than the region’s largest economy. For at least part of 2023, Chinese lenders may bear the brunt of President Xi Jinping’s draconian Covid-19 containment policies and the mainland’s cratering real-estate industry. Hong Kong and Singapore, where policymakers don’t set domestic interest rates and loan prices tend to closely track US borrowing costs, will see banks enjoy bumper profitability for a second straight year.

Still, the two rival cities’ fortunes are diverging in ways that are significant for the banks serving them. Talent is leaving Hong Kong in large numbers, and an overheated property market is starting to crumble. None of it bodes well for the Chinese special administrative region’s mortgage demand. Real-estate in Singapore, however, is still strong because a lot of the capital and people fleeing China and Hong Kong are headed its way. Which is why Singapore-based DBS Group Holdings Ltd., the biggest of the city-state’s three homegrown leaders, may have an edge next year over HSBC Holdings Plc, which relies on Hong Kong for a big part of its profit.

DBS’s September-quarter earnings released Thursday offered fresh clues. Net interest margin jumped 32 basis points from the previous three months to 1.9%, and net profit rose 23% to a record S$2.24 billion ($1.58 billion). The strong performance wasn’t exactly a surprise. HSBC recently upgraded its target for net interest income this year after margins surged 22 basis points.

With the Federal Reserve raising its key overnight rate by a jumbo-sized 75 basis points for a fourth straight meeting, and Chair Jerome Powell saying US interest rates will go higher than projected previously, banks can lend more profitably. Lenders with strong current and savings account franchises, which can afford to be slow to pass on higher rates to depositors, will benefit the most. In Asia, HSBC and Standard Chartered Plc in Hong Kong, DBS in Singapore, State Bank of India and Bank Rakyat Indonesia are all looking well-placed. A big exception is China, where interest margins will likely shrink again as authorities try to offset a deepening slowdown by lowering the cost of capital.

Singapore banks have an extra spring in their step. DBS and United Overseas Bank Ltd., a smaller rival, are both aggressively expanding their regional footprints. DBS acquired wealth and retail banking businesses in five Asian markets from Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in 2016. Since then, Chief Executive Officer Piyush Gupta has bought a troubled lender in India, picked up a stake in Shenzhen Rural Commercial Bank and is aiming for the top spot among foreign wealth managers and card issuers in Taiwan, where it has acquired Citigroup Inc.’s consumer-banking operations. UOB, controlled by Singapore billionaire Wee Cho Yaw, has gone for Citi’s consumer banking franchises in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, its first big takeover in 16 years. UOB, too, garnered a record third-quarter net profit.

After exiting more than 20 countries since the global financial crisis, HSBC will also want to start acquiring businesses, though CEO Noel Quinn has much less wiggle room: The bank’s equity capital is still below its medium-term target. Besides, the distraction of a split of its Asian operations demanded by Ping An Insurance Group Co., the UK bank’s largest shareholder, means it has to keep a grip on costs and meet its target of raising the return on tangible equity to 12% plus by 2023. (DBS reported a return on equity of 16.3%, an all-time high.) The sudden departure of HSBC’s chief financial officer has also added to uncertainty.

The other difference between the two financial centers in 2023 may lie in their lenders’ asset quality. HSBC recently set aside a tidy sum to cover its exposure to Chinese commercial real estate. The Hong Kong loan portfolio, too, will be a source of worry, after the city’s gross domestic product shrank a worse-than-expected 4.5% in the third quarter from a year earlier.

By contrast, DBS’s non-performing assets fell 5% in the third quarter. Delinquency in Singapore could become problematic, but only if authorities come in with heavy artillery to break up the city’s raging property mania. If the next round of so-called “cooling measures” bites and the market turns, homeowners might find themselves sitting on underwater mortgages. A tightening of total debt servicing norms — like in 2013 — could also see overstretched borrowers default on unsecured credit lines.

Those risks may or may not come to pass, unlike in China and Hong Kong, where the fault lines are clearly visible. Hong Kong’s finance summit this week, meant to serve as a signpost of the city’s post-pandemic reopening, has been marred by last-minute cancellations. Meanwhile, the seven-day lockdown of the area around the world’s largest iPhone factory in Zhengzhou shows that a relaxation in Xi’s Covid-Zero strategy early next year — a topic of intense speculation in the stock market — is not a given.

DBS’s Gupta is projecting net interest margins to rise further to 2.25% by the middle of next year, assuming the Fed stops its war on inflation at 4.75%. However, if the US economy tips into a recession and rates have to be quickly lowered, the jump in loan profitability that has pushed DBS shares to near-record highs could start to fade. Depending on how deep it is, a US downturn could also hurt credit quality in Singapore’s export-driven economy. Still, on current comparisons with their Hong Kong peers, Singapore lenders are clearly ahead in the race for 2023.

Authorities have pulled out all the stops for the gathering, tailoring restrictions for participants such as allowing them to dine in at specific restaurants, even as most other inbound travelers are banned from doing so for three days after they arrive in the city.

Illustrating the impatience in Hong Kong for a reopening on the neighboring Chinese mainland, the city's benchmark Hang Seng index jumped 5.2% on Tuesday following unconfirmed rumors that China may be beginning to plan to dismantle its stringent COVID-19 controls, which involve mass testing and sometimes lock-downs of entire neighborhoods or cities.

A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, told reporters he was “not aware of what you just mentioned” when asked about the rumor.

HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) -Chinese policymakers pledged on Wednesday that growth was still a priority and they would press on with reforms, helping further boost stock markets buoyed by hopes that Beijing will ease off on its strict COVID-19 measures.

The policymakers' comments came in an apparent bid to soothe fears that ideology could take precedence as Xi Jinping began a new leadership term and strict COVID curbs exact a growing toll on the world's second-largest economy.

Even though case numbers are rising and disruptive lockdowns continue with no clear exit strategy in sight, investors latched on to hope that China may ease its strict COVID policy in the coming months.

""We believe China could soon fine-tune its COVID restrictions, with a more targeted approach, less restrictive quarantine guidance and the more balanced assessment of the virus,"" Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note.

China and Hong Kong stocks ended higher for a second session on Wednesday, and U.S.-listed Chinese stocks rose in premarket trading.

On the ground, however, there were no signs of an ease up. Renewed COVID lockdowns are weighing heavily on China's business activity and consumer confidence.

In the latest fallout, electric vehicle maker NIO said it suspended production in the eastern city of Hefei amid rising COVID-19 cases and Yum China, operator of the KFC and Pizza Hut chains, said it was temporarily closing or reducing services at over 1,000 of its restaurants in China.

Luxury goods companies Estee Lauder Cos Inc and Canada Goose Holdings Inc also cut their full-year forecasts, blaming a hit from persistent COVID-19-related lockdowns and store closures in China.

Xi secured a third term as general secretary at the ruling Communist Party's twice-a-decade congress last month, when he urged the party to brace for hardship and strengthen national security, and renewed his support for the zero-COVID policy, despite the fragile economy.

In pre-recorded interviews for the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit in Hong Kong, senior officials from China's central bank, securities and banking regulators assured their audience via a video link that China would keep its currency and property markets stable, and remained committed to a pro-growth economic strategy.

""International investors should read more carefully about the work report that President Xi delivered"" at the congress, said Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC).

""There, he re-emphasized the centrality of economic growth in the entire work of the Party and the country, and that's very significant,"" showing China is fully focused on growth, he said.

Fang also criticised international media coverage, saying that a lot of reports ""really don't understand China very well"" and had a short-term focus.

As foreign funds head for the exits, Chinese investors have been snapping up cheapened shares of mainland firms, betting that outside views of China have been excessively negative.

OPEN-DOOR POLICY

Yi Gang, governor of the People's Bank of China (PBOC), said China will continue to deregulate its markets.

""Reform and open-door policy will continue,"" Yi said.

Apparently seeking to ease worries over the impact of COVID lockdowns and a property market crisis, Yi said ""the Chinese economy has remained broadly on track despite some challenges and downward pressure.""

""I expect China's potential growth rate to remain in a reasonable range,"" Yi said, citing the country's ""super large"" market, a rising middle-class, technological innovation and a high-quality infrastructure network.

Separately, in a book entitled ""A Supplementary Reading of the 20th Communist Party Congress Report"" and cited in local media on Wednesday, Yi said China is in a position to maintain ""normal"" monetary policy and ""positive"" interest rates.

Global interest rate hikes have pressured yuan assets, and it is impossible for China to keep cutting interest rates in the long run, Wang Jun, director at China Chief Economist Forum, told Reuters.

While other countries have been tightening policy to battle rising prices, China has implemented an accommodative monetary policy to shore up sputtering growth, raising concerns about capital flight. The yuan has weakened roughly 13% against the dollar this year.

But Yi said the yuan has appreciated against other major currencies, ""maintaining its purchasing power and keeping its value stable.""

CRISES

Noting China's property crisis, and the sector's links to other many other industries, Yi said, ""We hope‌‌ the housing market‌‌ can achieve a soft landing‌‌.""

With China's zero-COVID policy expected to remain in place through at least the winter, or longer, its near-term growth outlook is bleak.

Fears of renewed disruptions to global supply chains are resurfacing.

On Wednesday, a Chinese industrial park that hosts an iPhone factory belonging to Foxconn announced a fresh lockdown.

""We expect Beijing to maintain its zero-Covid strategy at least until March 2023,"" according to Nomura.

After surprisingly high gross domestic product growth of 3.9% in the third quarter, Nomura expects growth to drop again, with zero or even negative sequential growth from the previous quarter.

""We maintain our GDP growth forecast of 2.8% year-on-year for the fourth quarter with a corresponding sequential growth forecast at 0.0%.""

76c23587-dd59-443b-af5c-485af064c4eb,"China has been in the news plenty this year. First there was the controversy surrounding Beijing’s hosting of the Winter Olympics. And then the United Nations issued a report confirming China’s “crimes against humanity.” Clearly, China is an egregious violator of human rights. But despite such global notoriety, America’s financial industry has remained curiously indifferent.

In fact, America’s major investment firms continue to maintain a cozy relationship with Beijing. And nowhere is this more apparent than the upcoming Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit in Hong Kong.

Hong Kong is a curious choice for any free-market summit. Once considered a sovereign region, Hong Kong has increasingly come under Beijing’s control. And since 2019, the territory has progressively cracked down on dissent—with protesters facing extradition to mainland China.

It’s evident that Hong Kong is now under Beijing’s thumb. But apparently that doesn’t trouble the Wall Street executives from Goldman Sachs GS, +1.30% , Citigroup C, +1.77% , Morgan Stanley MS, +2.18% , and BlackRock BLK, +0.28% who are already lining up to attend the Hong Kong summit. This is doubly disturbing when one considers that Hong Kong’s new chief executive, John Lee, was handpicked by Beijing to help cement China’s crackdown on protesters.

Wall Street revealed its tilt toward China in a recent congressional hearing, when some of the nation’s top banking executives testified before both houses of Congress. When questioned about a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan, the CEOs agreed that they would do whatever the U.S. government required in such a crisis. But this was just posturing.

More telling was a comment by Citigroup’s Jane Fraser. When asked if she would condemn China’s ongoing human-rights abuses, Fraser said, “Condemn is a strong word. We certainly are very distressed to see it.”

Wall Street is simply far more focused on reaping massive profits from its investments in China. It’s estimated, for example, that JPMorgan Chase JPM, +1.19% holds roughly $20 billion worth of investments in China. Such massive holdings evidently outweigh concerns over China’s appalling human-rights record.

That’s worrying because, in addition to genocide, Beijing has overseen the mass transfer of Uyghurs and other ethnic groups in the Far West region of Xinjiang to factories throughout China. And more than 80,000 Uyghurs were transferred out of Xinjiang between 2017 and 2019 alone. Under forced-labor conditions, many of them are now working in factories tied to at least 82 well-known global brands, including Apple AAPL, +4.86% , BMW BMW, -0.86% , Gap GPS, -0.41% , Huawei, Nike NKE, +3.24% , Samsung 005930, +0.64% , Sony SONY, +1.02% , and Volkswagen VOW, +1.64% .

This hasn’t been sufficient to scare off Wall Street, though. Thanks to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other investment products, America’s major investment houses are steadily profiting off of Beijing’s wider ambitions—even if that includes efforts to modernize China’s military.

A good example is CSSC Holdings Ltd. 600150, -0.72% (CSSC), China’s largest builder of naval vessels. Thanks to Beijing’s efforts to raise funds through capital markets, CSSC is listed in several major investment indexes. In fact, CSSC was able to raise $8.63 billion from debt markets through 2015, helping it to launch a new Chinese warship—the Fujian—intended to rival America’s largest and most advanced aircraft carrier.

Wall Street’s comfort with helping China finance its military buildup defies common sense. But America’s corporate leaders appear entirely disconnected from the long-term concerns this poses.

Since Wall Street won’t change course, Congress must now step in—particularly to help prevent a potentially costly war in the Pacific.

Congress has the authority to address the transparency, disclosure, and due-diligence requirements of Wall Street and the financial sector—not to mention the ability to create sanctions. And so, step one for Congress should be to ban the sale of any investment products that help to fund China’s military buildup.

The upcoming financial summit in Hong Kong makes clear that Wall Street CEOs will shamelessly pander to Beijing. This is unacceptable. America’s banking executives—who publicly give lip-service to leaving China in the event of a Taiwan invasion—should be confronted with the hypocrisy of their actions. Congress should act to make sure that sanctioned and bad-actor Chinese securities are no longer traded on Wall Street. That’s the only logical response to Beijing’s abhorrent behavior.

HONG KONG (AP) — Chinese regulators downplayed China’s real estate slump and slowing economic growth while Hong Kong's top leader pitched Hong Kong as a unique link to the rest of China at a high-profile investment summit Wednesday.

About 200 global financial executives gathered to network and discuss issues such as global risks and sustainable finance at Hong Kong’s first major conference since the city lifted COVID-19 quarantine restrictions.

Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, urged those attending to visit China to understand what is happening in the country and urged them not to “bet against” China and Hong Kong.

International media “don’t really understand China very well” and have a “short-term focus,” he said, drawing laughter and applause from the audience.

Fang and other Chinese officials addressed the conference in prerecorded interviews — travel to and from mainland China is constrained by strict quarantine requirements.

China's central bank governor, Yi Gang, said that inflation remains subdued, at under 3% compared with 8% or more in many Western economies, and the country's economic and reform policies will continue. Such comments appeared to be meant to counter worries that flared following a Communist Party congress last month, where leader Xi Jinping was awarded an unprecedented third five-year term and key reformers were excluded from top ruling party leadership.

“China has a super large market, as there is still much room for urbanization and the demand of middle class consumers is still on the rise,” said Yi.

China’s economy grew at a 3.9% annual pace in the last quarter compared to a year earlier, well below an official target of more than 5%, and the vital real estate sector has languished as regulators have sought to curb debt mounting toward unsustainable levels.

Xiao Yuanqi, vice chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, sought to reassure those attending the conference, saying property loans make up just 26% banks' total lending and 90% of property loans were “good quality.”

Shares in both Hong Kong and Shanghai surged Wednesday, with the Hang Seng gaining 2.4% while the Shanghai Composite index climbed 1.2%.

The speakers lineup at the Hong Kong conference includes Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon and other leading executives from institutions such as Citigroup and Blackstone.

It is designed to highlight the former British colony's role as an attractive and competitive financial hub.

The city remains the “only place in the world where the global advantage and the China advantage come together in a single city,” Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee said in opening the event.

“This unique convergence makes Hong Kong the irreplaceable connection between the mainland and the rest of the world as the center of economic gravity in the world shifts eastward,” he said.

The British handed control of Hong Kong to China in 1997 with the understanding that Beijing would allow the tiny territory autonomy in its legal system and economic policies for at least 50 years. In recent years Beijing has been expanding its influence. Such efforts gained momentum after mass protests in 2019 demanding a more democratic system of leadership, culminating in the implementation of a security law designed to quash dissent.

Combined with strict quarantine controls and a sharp downturn in tourism, that has compounded the economic impact from the pandemic.

Lee said the “worst is behind” Hong Kong. A former security chief, he told the conference “law and order has returned"" and social disturbances were in the past.

Organizers pushed ahead with the long-planned conference despite tropical storm warnings that led authorities to close schools.

As tropical storm Nalgae drew closer to the city, the Hong Kong Observatory said that it would raise its T8 signal in the afternoon, which would effectively shut down the city and stop trading on the stock market.

Hong Kong pulled out all the stops for the financial conference, adjusting COVID-19 restrictions to allow participants to dine in at specific restaurants. Most other inbound travelers are banned from doing so for three days after they arrive in the city.

Attendees who test positive for COVID-19 are allowed to leave by chartered flights if they want to, instead of having to be isolated for at least seven days in Hong Kong.

Some U.S. lawmakers have urged American companies not to participate in the meeting given tensions with China over trade and human rights. The U.S. has been vocal about Hong Kong's crackdown on dissent following implementation of the National Security Law."

Fang and other Chinese officials addressed the conference in prerecorded interviews — travel to and from mainland China is constrained by strict quarantine requirements.

China's central bank governor, Yi Gang, said that inflation remains subdued, at under 3% compared with 8% or more in many Western economies, and the country's economic and reform policies will continue. Such comments appeared to be meant to counter worries that flared following a Communist Party congress last month, where leader Xi Jinping was awarded an unprecedented third five-year term and key reformers were excluded from top ruling party leadership.

“China has a super large market, as there is still much room for urbanization and the demand of middle class consumers is still on the rise,” said Yi.

China’s economy grew at a 3.9% annual pace in the last quarter compared to a year earlier, well below an official target of more than 5%, and the vital real estate sector has languished as regulators have sought to curb debt mounting toward unsustainable levels.

Xiao Yuanqi, vice chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, sought to reassure those attending the conference, saying property loans make up just 26% banks' total lending and 90% of property loans were “good quality.”

Shares in both Hong Kong and Shanghai surged Wednesday, with the Hang Seng gaining 2.4% while the Shanghai Composite index climbed 1.2%.

The speakers lineup at the Hong Kong conference includes Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon and other leading executives from institutions such as Citigroup and Blackstone.

It is designed to highlight the former British colony's role as an attractive and competitive financial hub.

The city remains the “only place in the world where the global advantage and the China advantage come together in a single city,” Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee said in opening the event.

“This unique convergence makes Hong Kong the irreplaceable connection between the mainland and the rest of the world as the center of economic gravity in the world shifts eastward,” he said.

The British handed control of Hong Kong to China in 1997 with the understanding that Beijing would allow the tiny territory autonomy in its legal system and economic policies for at least 50 years. In recent years Beijing has been expanding its influence. Such efforts gained momentum after mass protests in 2019 demanding a more democratic system of leadership, culminating in the implementation of a security law designed to quash dissent.

Combined with strict quarantine controls and a sharp downturn in tourism, that has compounded the economic impact from the pandemic.

Lee said the “worst is behind” Hong Kong. A former security chief, he told the conference “law and order has returned"" and social disturbances were in the past.

Organizers pushed ahead with the long-planned conference despite tropical storm warnings that led authorities to close schools.

As tropical storm Nalgae drew closer to the city, the Hong Kong Observatory said that it would raise its T8 signal in the afternoon, which would effectively shut down the city and stop trading on the stock market.

Hong Kong pulled out all the stops for the financial conference, adjusting COVID-19 restrictions to allow participants to dine in at specific restaurants. Most other inbound travelers are banned from doing so for three days after they arrive in the city.

Attendees who test positive for COVID-19 are allowed to leave by chartered flights if they want to, instead of having to be isolated for at least seven days in Hong Kong.

Some U.S. lawmakers have urged American companies not to participate in the meeting given tensions with China over trade and human rights. The U.S. has been vocal about Hong Kong's crackdown on dissent following implementation of the National Security Law."

HONG KONG, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Hong Kong and Chinese officials on Wednesday touted the city's connection to the world's second-largest economy as they looked to restore its reputation as a global financial hub after years of punishing COVID crackdowns.

Hong Kong's status as a premier financial centre has been clouded by strict anti-virus restrictions, anti-government protests in 2019 and China's imposition of a sweeping national security law on the city a year later.

An international business conference on Wednesday was the biggest corporate event in Hong Kong since it shut its borders in 2020 to combat the pandemic. Those measures have badly hit the economy and have resulted in an exodus of talent.

""Hong Kong remains the only place in the world where the global advantage and the China advantage come together in a single city,"" Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee told about 250 participants in the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit, organised by the city's de-facto central bank the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).

""This unique convergence makes Hong Kong the irreplaceable connection between the mainland and the rest of the world.""

Some of the world's biggest banking bosses, including Goldman Sachs' (GS.N) David Solomon and Morgan Stanley's James Gorman, were in Hong Kong for the first time in almost three years for the summit.

For foreign financial firms operating in China and Hong Kong, the summit comes as they navigate growing tensions between the United States and China, which have also caught the former British colony in the crosshairs.

Two U.S. lawmakers last week urged top American bankers to cancel their attendance, saying participation would contribute to human rights abuses by China's government. Beijing rejects accusations of rights abuses.

In pre-recorded interviews for the summit, China's top regulatory officials on Wednesday also pledged their support to Hong Kong and said reforms and liberalisation would continue in China to attract foreign investors.

China Securities Regulatory Commission vice chairman Fang Xinghai said its opening-up policy has a ""firm foundation"", while criticising international media coverage, saying that a lot of reports ""really don't understand China very well"".

UBS Group (UBSG.S) Chairman Colm Kelleher agreed.

""Whilst we are all very pro-China, and like vice chairman Fang said we are not reading the American press, we actually buy the story, but it is a bit (of a) waiting for zero-Covid to open up in China and see what will happen,"" he said.

China is fighting its largest COVID outbreak since the summer as cases again erupt across the country, triggering concerns that Beijing's heavy-handed response to outbreaks is exacting a growing toll on the world's second-largest economy. read more

GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES

Hong Kong chief Lee said the city would continue working towards lifting COVID-19 restrictions.

The city's economy shrank faster in the third quarter, contracting 4.5% from the same period a year earlier, the third straight quarterly downturn, as geopolitical tensions, China's slowdown and lingering pandemic worries weighed.

Lee said that Hong Kong was working to attract top talent to offset a major brain drain in the past three years due to pandemic rules.

Hong Kong has eased COVID curbs in recent weeks, with the city scrapping a hotel quarantine requirement for all visitors in September.

The summit saw business leaders gather in a hotel ballroom without facemasks, which are still mandatory outdoors.

""It is great for Hong Kong to open up and we are glad to be back,"" Anand Selvakesari, CEO of personal banking and wealth management of Citigroup told Reuters on the sidelines of the conference.

MARKET VOLATILITY

Global financial institutions have long flocked to Hong Kong as a springboard into China, looking to tap into its rapidly expanding economy and its trillions of dollars worth of financial markets.

Held against the backdrop of heightened market volatility, top bankers at the summit said central banks will get inflation under control, but there will be turbulence in the near-term due to monetary tightening and geopolitical risks.

Inflation and a very quick tightening of monetary conditions after over a decade of relatively accommodative monetary policies make the world more volatile, and uncertain, said David Solomon, chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs (GS.N).

It ""allows exposures where there's leverage in the system to be amplified very quickly,"" he said, while pointing to the recent markey volatility in the UK as an example of how things could go wrong during a liquidity squeeze.

abea7d65-645d-49e1-8487-583f9fbdcb59,"The financial centre is hoping to convince the world it is back in business after nearly three years of pandemic curbs.

Hong Kong, China – Simon Friend, 35, was working from home in Amsterdam last month when he heard murmurings that Hong Kong would finally reopen to the world.

Friend, a devotee of the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens, the city’s biggest sporting event, could hardly wait to book a flight.

The tournament, which is being held from November 4-6, is taking place for the first time in two years after Hong Kong lifted some of the world’s strictest COVID-19 curbs, including compulsory hotel quarantine for arrivals.

“This will be my 25th Hong Kong Rugby Sevens, it’s safe to say I’m a big fan,” Friend told Al Jazeera.

“It’s coming up to two years since I’ve seen friends and family there. No hotel quarantine plus being able to attend the Sevens was a no-brainer for me. A win-win.”

“The Sevens is hands down the best party of the year in Hong Kong, every year,” he added. “It’s the best reason to have a few drinks and to get dressed up in fancy dress and party.”

Hong Kong’s government hopes that the sporting event, along with a high-profile international banking summit that kicked off on Tuesday, will signal that the city is open for business amid fears for its status as an international financial hub.

Still, visitors to the city will have to endure restrictions long ago abandoned elsewhere, including multiple COVID tests, mask mandates and a three-day monitoring period during which venues such as restaurants and bars are off limits.

Those that do come will find a city in recession, its economy battered by the twin shocks of harsh pandemic curbs and a sweeping Beijing-led crackdown on dissent.

Hong Kong’s retail and tourism sectors were already reeling from the 2019 pro-democracy protests when the government’s severe response to COVID-19 plunged the city into its second recession in three years.

Hong Kong’s “dynamic zero COVID” policies, including hotel quarantine, severely disrupted the operations of businesses in the city, setting in motion a record exodus of skilled professionals from the city.

Financial firms like Citigroup have relocated some key staff and functions out of Hong Kong, while United States fashion giant VF Corp and French IT services firm Capgemini moved their regional head offices to Singapore.

‘Devastating’

Established in 1976, the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens was by far the city’s biggest money-spinning sporting event before the pandemic, drawing tens of thousands of visitors from all over the world.

For the Hong Kong Rugby Union, which relies on the Sevens for 95 per cent of its annual revenue, the return of the tournament is seen as nothing less than a matter of survival.

“The last three years have been devastating for the Union and the rugby community,” Robbie McRobbie, CEO of the Hong Kong Rugby Union, told Al Jazeera.

“With no tournament since 2019 we have accumulated over $250 million Hong Kong dollars [$31.8m] of losses which has led to half our staff losing their jobs.”

McRobbie said the competition is an important signal that the city is “bouncing back” and open for business.

“Normally we only sell 20,000 tickets locally, but we’ve already sold about 26,000, so we are already ahead of that — we’re happy with domestic demand, and very appreciative of the continued support of the local community,” he said.

Still, McRobbie said the restrictions — including testing and mask-wearing requirements at the event itself — would keep away international visitors, which usually make up about half of the 40,000 spectators.

“Our fans like to enjoy Hong Kong’s nightlife when they come to town,” he said.

Allan Zeman, a property tycoon known as the godfather of the Lan Kwai Fong party district, said that the ending of quarantine, while “a breath of fresh air,” was not enough to bring back visitors to Hong Kong.

“Tourists are definitely the last piece of the puzzle for Hong Kong, but they won’t come back in numbers under the ‘0+3’ restrictions,” Zeman told Al Jazeera, referring to the three-day monitoring period for arrivals that prohibits them from venues such as restaurants and bars.

Zeman, who is also a government adviser, believes Hong Kong leader John Lee probably erred on the conservative side due to the recent Communist Party Congress in China.

“Nobody wanted to take a chance to upset [Beijing] that week,” said Zeman.

“I think the government here decided that it was not the appropriate time to go for ‘0+0’, that ‘0+3’ was already as much as they can push it for now.”

Banking executives and other financial leaders attending the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, the banking summit taking place November 1-3, will have a reprieve from the restrictions facing other travellers.

In a statement, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the host of the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, said government-approved “infection control arrangements” would be in place to provide the “necessary facilitation” for participants to take part in the summit and carry out business activities. HKMA has emphasised the importance of the event being in person to allow guests to meet staff and clients and form relationships.

With the exception of JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, who was controversially given an exemption from the city’s quarantine rules at the height of the pandemic, the summit will mark the first time some of the biggest names on Wall Street touch down in the financial hub since the pandemic began.

Zeman, who will be attending the summit, said the event is a “vote of confidence for Hong Kong”.

“These institutions,” Zeman said, “have always regarded Hong Kong as their head offices for Asia.”

Zeman said Hong Kong’s position as a gateway between East and West makes it an ideal location for such an event.

“China is too big and important of a market for any bank in the world to turn their back on,” he said.

Others are less optimistic.

Martin Young, a professor at Massey University in New Zealand who chairs the Asian Shadow Financial Regulatory Committee, said Hong Kong’s partial reopening will not be enough to revive the economy this year.

“It is important for [Hong Kong] to open up as quickly as possible,” Young told Al Jazeera. “Scrapping all COVID pandemic measures will definitely have a positive impact on domestic consumption and visitor spending but it is only part of the problem that Hong Kong faces.”

With economic woes deepening and calls for an end to all restrictions growing louder, Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee has rolled out measures to attract talent and investment, including a 30-billion Hong Kong dollar ($3.8-bn) fund to support business in the city.

Gary Ng, a senior economist at Natixis, said that such announcements, while welcome, are stopgap measures.

“It will be less costly for the government and society with a fully reopened business environment,” Ng told Al Jazeera.

“With another year of fiscal deficit, the Hong Kong government probably cannot afford more spending and will have fewer resources to deploy for long-term problems if growth does not rebound.”

Investor confidence in the city’s ability to navigate the crisis has waned. Reports about China’s slowing economy and delayed economic data last week sent the Hang Seng Index tumbling to 15180 — its lowest since the 2009 financial crisis.

Ng said the government bore the blame for “80 percent of the recession risk it is facing”.

“While the government cannot control the policy in mainland China, it has room to adjust its approach by removing all COVID-related restrictions.”

Young said the city should transition fully to living with the virus like the rest of the world, including rival Singapore, which last month took Hong Kong’s spot as Asia’s leading financial centre on the 2022 Global Financial Index.

“Could Hong Kong have handled COVID better? It is much easier to determine best practice in hindsight but if there was a place that one might say did best, I would give that to Singapore,” Young said.

“In my view the time is now right for Hong Kong to follow Singapore’s lead in dealing with COVID.”"
1088ec23-df50-4db9-8225-7c2d18d6526e,"













HONG KONG, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Hong Kong aims to restore its reputation as a global financial hub by playing host to a bevy of top Wall Street executives this week, defying critics who say a talent crunch and geopolitical tensions will hobble its ambition.

The high-profile summit is the first in almost three years in the city since anti-government protests, the imposition of a sweeping national security law and strict COVID-19 curbs weakened its status as a premier financial centre.

The Global Financial Leaders Investment Summit begins on Wednesday with participants including Goldman Sachs (GS.N) Chief Executive David Solomon, Morgan Stanley boss James Gorman, HSBC's (HSBA.L) Noel Quinn and Standard Chartered's (STAN.L) Bill Winters.

Alongside the main theme of ""navigating through uncertainty"", the summit is widely expected to focus on Hong Kong's ambition to remain a global financial centre after almost three years of border controls and pandemic restrictions.

For foreign financial firms operating in China and Hong Kong, however, navigating tensions between the United States and China and a depleting pool of talent in what is touted as ""Asia's world city"" will continue to prove challenging, analysts said.

""The Hong Kong government's overarching goal is clear: to establish the narrative that the city has reopened,"" said Chris Beddor, Gavekal Dragonomics' deputy China research director.

Global banks are playing their cards reasonably well in the face of tougher political environment, he said, though there has been a shift among the expatriate workforce from Hong Kong to other locations, such as Singapore.

""The geopolitical situation has deteriorated rapidly over the past two years or so, and the political environment in China has clearly shifted as well, both of which present hard-to-quantify long-term risks.""

Underscoring the tension, two U.S. lawmakers last week urged top American bankers to cancel their attendance, saying participation would contribute to human rights abuses by China's government. Beijing rejects accusations of rights abuses.

COVID-19 CONTROLS

The two-day summit, organised by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) - the de-facto central bank - saw at least two high-profile cancellations because of COVID-19.

Blackstone (BX.N) President Jonathan Gray will not attend after testing positive for the virus, and will be replaced by finance chief Michael Chae, a spokesperson said on Monday.

Citigroup (C.N) CEO Jane Fraser will also not attend due to COVID-19 infection, Reuters reported on Thursday.

An updated programme, necessary because of replacement of a small number of speakers forced to cancel mainly because of ""unexpected personal circumstances"" will be released on Tuesday, HKMA said in a statement late on Monday.

The city's Financial Secretary Paul Chan, one of the main speakers, also contracted COVID-19 during a visit to Saudi Arabia , the government said last week. Chan, however, later tested negative and is expected to return to Hong Kong on Tuesday, a government statement said on Monday.

Participants will look for reassurances of a return to pre-pandemic normality, making it easier for them to attract staff to Hong Kong.

HKMA head Eddie Yue told a local newspaper last week the event would send a clear message that ""Hong Kong is back"", and it would be the ""fireworks which draw the eyeballs of global talent"".

""I totally agree that the conference hopefully can be a very beautiful fireworks display,"" said Gary Ng, Hong Kong-based senior economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis. ""But it depends on what happens after.""

HONG KONG (AP) — Chinese regulators downplayed China’s real estate slump and slowing economic growth while Hong Kong's top leader pitched Hong Kong as a unique link to the rest of China at a high-profile investment summit Wednesday.

About 200 global financial executives gathered to network and discuss issues such as global risks and sustainable finance at Hong Kong’s first major conference since the city lifted COVID-19 quarantine restrictions.

Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, urged those attending to visit China to understand what is happening in the country and urged them not to “bet against” China and Hong Kong.

HONG KONG (AP) — A tropic storm and absences of VIP guests have cast a shadow over a financial conference meant to help Hong Kong restore its image as a financial hub and destination for business travel.

The first major conference since the city lifted COVID-19 quarantine restrictions was due to begin Wednesday. But at least four top executives from institutions including the CEOs of Citigroup and Barclays, who had been expected to attend the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, are dropping out.

The Hong Kong Observatory is forecasting that tropical storm Nalgae will likely bring torrential rains as it passes 200 kilometers (120 miles) to the southwest, in further bad news for organizers of the meeting.

At least four top finance executives initially slated to attend the conference this week have dropped out. They include Blackstone Inc. President Jonathan Gray and Citigroup Inc.’s CEO Jane Fraser, who will no longer attend the conference after contracting COVID-19. The CEO of Barclays, C.S. Venkatakrishnan, also has scrapped plans to go. Gray was slated to speak in a panel on global uncertainty, while Fraser was supposed to discuss sustainable finance.

On Tuesday, Capital Group Cos.’ CEO Timothy Armour became the latest chief executive to withdraw from the conference, for health reasons.

The city’s T3 strong wind signal was in force Tuesday, with the possibility a higher signal might be raised, depending on the storm. Typically, most businesses close and events are postponed if a T8 strong wind signal is raised.

The main events of the conference take place Wednesday.

Authorities have pulled out all the stops for the gathering, tailoring restrictions for participants such as allowing them to dine in at specific restaurants, even as most other inbound travelers are banned from doing so for three days after they arrive in the city.

Other restrictions include allowing attendees who test positive for COVID-19 to leave by chartered flights if they want to, instead of having to be isolated for at least seven days in Hong Kong.

Hong Kong leader John Lee said it was to be a “vibrant” week for Hong Kong.

When asked if the restrictions designed for conference participants constituted a “double standard,” Lee said different plans are formulated to ensure activities can go ahead.

“It’s on these principles that we put in place certain measures so that some major events can go ahead in Hong Kong,” he said.

Illustrating the impatience in Hong Kong for a reopening on the neighboring Chinese mainland, the city's benchmark Hang Seng index jumped 5.2% on Tuesday following unconfirmed rumors that China may be beginning to plan to dismantle its stringent COVID-19 controls, which involve mass testing and sometimes lock-downs of entire neighborhoods or cities.

A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, told reporters he was “not aware of what you just mentioned” when asked about the rumor.

Some U.S. lawmakers have urged American companies not to participate in the meeting given tensions with China over trade and human rights. The U.S. has been vocal about a crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong after the semi-autonomous territory implemented its National Security Law.

Sen. Jeff Merkley and Rep. Jim McGovern, who chair the Congressional Executive Commission on China, urged financial executives to reconsider their decision to attend the Hong Kong event.

“Their presence only serves to legitimize the swift dismantling of Hong Kong’s autonomy, free press, and the rule of law by Hong Kong authorities acting along with the Chinese Communist Party,” they said in a statement.

After loosening its once strict pandemic precautions, Hong Kong is trying to get back on track as a destination for all kinds of tourism.

The former British colony is due to hold the Hong Kong Sevens rugby tournament from Nov. 4-6, for the first since the pandemic began. The city's is also holding a five-day “FinTech Week,"" with hundreds of exhibitors and speakers and an expected total turnout of thousands."

Earlier this year it had to swallow a loss of £17.8billion on its stake in Russia’s Rosneft and now it faces accusations of profiteering.

The company’s estimate that it will end up paying £2.2billion of taxes on its UK operations in the current financial year has not satisfied critics.

Nor is anyone willing to give chief executive Bernard Looney credit for the company’s embrace of a green agenda more ambitious than any other oil major, with a commitment to net zero by 2050 and to spend £18billion in the UK over the next eight years on renewable projects.

Looney wasn’t kidding when he remarked that the company had become ‘cash machine’. In these days of exceptionally high oil and gas prices BP earnings more than doubled to £7.1billion in the third quarter.

What fuelled the anger of dissenters is a £2.2bpillion share buyback. The ‘progressive’ think-tank IPPR, a favourite of the Blair-Brown era, argues that such buybacks are a transfer of income from the poorest households to wealthy shareholders.

It notes that US President Joe Biden, who accuses big oil of ‘war profiteering’, is targeting buybacks and demands the UK do the same with a swingeing 25 per cent levy.

What it fails to mention is the US levy on buybacks has been set at just 1 per cent. This is a bit like praising Biden’s increase in taxes on the highest earners which starts at $400,000 a year.

Investors like a mix of share buybacks and dividends because the former enjoys better tax treatment. It needs to be asked who the ‘already wealthy’ shareholders might be?

Most of them are pension funds. And with New Labour’s reforms of the pensions industry, the vast majority of the workforce are now automatically enrolled in private sector pensions, as is the case in Australia and Sweden.

The main issue for pensions analysts is whether colleagues are paying in enough.

Oil majors, because of cash generation, are big contributors to all private pensions, supporting more vulnerable members of society who are in the workforce. Taxing share buybacks looks like an easy hit.

But as was the case in 1997, when dividend tax relief for pension funds was abolished, the Government must recognise the unintended consequences of even a small move on the fiscal dial.

Keeping faith

A near-40 per cent jump in the share price of online grocer Ocado is good to behold.

In Ocado’s case, it is worth remembering that stock in Tim Steiner’s creation has fallen to a third of a peak valuation a year ago.

The evergreen critique of Ocado has been that it has failed to sell its network of robotic warehouses, known as Customer Fulfilment Centres, into enough markets.

That is patently untrue given the addition of South Korea’s Lotte Shopping to a list now made up of 12 alliances.

The difficulty with Ocado is that investors can never be sure when deals signed will generate cash flows.

Patience with the Korean venture, as with previous tie-ups, is necessary as no cash fees will be recognised until revenue operations commence.

Aside from the joint venture with M&S, visibility on Ocado’s future earnings is tricky. Ocado has asked for forbearance and for investors to buy into the Amazon narrative of losses in the investment phase followed by an income gusher. For the sake of the UK’s vibrant but depleted tech sector, in Steiner we must trust.

The 2022 stock market crash wiped out billions from market capitalization and shattered investor confidence just as the market and the economy as a whole were starting to recover from the coronavirus pandemic. The ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine has shocked the global energy markets, which has driven up the price of commodities such as oil and natural gas and contributed to inflation. This contribution in itself has come at a time when central bank balance sheets are at historic high levels as the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and the coronavirus pandemic led the banks to provide easy access to money. These high levels, which themselves contribute to inflation by increasing the money supply in the market, can only be controlled through high interest rates. The rates end up making it harder for companies to manage their working capital and raise funding, which saps investor confidence already rattled by inflation.

In the midst of all this, a host of companies see their share prices drop simply because capital allocation is being readjusted in hedge fund portfolios. The allocation depresses their share price without a due cause being present in the fundamental performance. Additionally, the market entering bear territory does not mean that all stocks will see their share prices drop. Some of these, as you will find out throughout this list, have in fact seen their share prices rise year to date.

Some sectors that will continue to grow and have grown this year include energy and fertilizers. For instance, a research report from Allied Markets Research estimates that the fertilizer industry was worth $184 billion last year and it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.55% from then until 2030 to stand at a value of $252 billion by the end of the forecast period. Additionally, the natural gas market is an investor favorite these days, and The Business Research Company wagers that this segment, which was worth $840 billion last year, will grow at a whopping CAGR of 12% to sit at $940 billion this year and from then until 2030 will go on to grow at a CAGR of 6.9% to be worth $1.23 trillion.

This piece will focus on growth companies too, and the top picks are PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS).

8. Compass Minerals International, Inc. (NYSE:CMP)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 17

Compass Minerals International, Inc. (NYSE:CMP) is a minerals company that mines and sells items such as salt and its derivatives, fertilizers, potassium products, and plant nutrients. The company is headquartered in Overland Park, Kansas, the United States.

Using Compass Minerals International, Inc. (NYSE:CMP)'s management forecast of $220 million to $250 million for this year, and using it to forecast a net income of $42 million, leads to an enterprise value to operating income ratio ranging between 3.3 to 22.1. Compared to the industry range of 4.5 to 86.9, this makes the stock quite undervalued. Compass Minerals International, Inc. (NYSE:CMP) also received $252 million in funding from the Koch Group in September 2022, which will boost the company's lithium carbonate production.

Compass Minerals International, Inc. (NYSE:CMP) pays a 15 cent dividend for a 1.5% yield. Insider Monkey studied 895 hedge fund portfolios for their June quarter of 2022 investments to discover that 17 had held a stake in the company.

Compass Minerals International, Inc. (NYSE:CMP)'s largest investor is Jeffery Bronchick's Cove Street Capital which owns 535,692 shares that are worth $18 million.

Bernzott Capital Advisors mentioned the company in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:

“Compass Minerals International, Inc. (NYSE:CMP): Despite a strong winter season in which salt volumes came in higher than expectations buoyed by a more normalized snowfall year, higher logistics and freight costs negatively impacted the bottom line. Within their plant nutrient segment, margins remained strong driven by strong potash pricing, however drought conditions negatively impacted overall volumes. Looking ahead, CMP should benefit from improved pricing during the upcoming salt selling season while actions taken within their plant segment to improve efficiencies should help improve overall results. Finally, the company is making progress in the development of its Lithium assets, supported by a recent offtake agreement with a leading global manufacturer of lithium-ion batteries which we believe is not reflected in the current stock price.”

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22

Accounting for $767 million in cash and $703 million in debt, the firm's enterprise value sits at $937 million, while at an $8 share price (current share price is $8.24), its market capitalization is $1 billion. The firm also increased its annual revenue guidance to $415 million - $425 million this year, over the previous guidance of $405 million - $415 million, to mark a remarkable 17% to 19% growth in an environment that has not seen technology companies perform well.

All the tightening moves by the Federal Reserve this year to rein in inflation are supposed to lead to less hiring and spending by companies. But there is no law that says the biggest, most profitable companies have to cut back if they don’t feel like it. And the cuts showing up in this quarter’s earnings reports from the biggest tech companies amount to going from three scoops of ice cream to two.

If you’re wondering why employment growth has been robust despite the warning signs in financial markets, the structural change in Silicon Valley that’s happened since the early 2000s dot-com bust is a big part of it.

The employment numbers this quarter from some of the biggest tech companies were a surprise because of reports over the past few months of layoffs and hiring freezes in the sector. Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google, added 13,000 employees this quarter. Meta Platforms Inc., parent of Facebook, added 3,800. And Amazon.com Inc., after shedding 100,000 employees in the second quarter when its warehouses were overstaffed, returned to growth, adding 21,000 workers.

Advertisement

And this was not a particularly strong quarter for the companies’ best-known business lines. Online ad revenues have been sluggish due to overall economic uncertainty, and e-commerce volumes continue to be sluggish as consumers shift their spending habits from goods to services.

Adding to that sluggishness has been a revenue headwind from the rise in the dollar and less progress on cost control than investors want. The result: Profit margins have suffered and the value of stocks has plunged this year. To the extent the Fed thinks a slumping stock market helps its mission, that’s useful. But if it’s also determined to get the labor market back into better balance, it’s not clear how much help they’ll be getting from the biggest and most profitable tech companies.

While Alphabet and Amazon emphasized they’re working on controlling costs, both companies seem likely to continue to add workers. Alphabet talked about headcount additions slowing by about half this quarter compared with the third quarter, but that still implies a decent amount of growth. Amazon said it slashed the capital spending budget for its e-commerce business this year by about a third of its initial plans. Yet continued investment in its streaming and lucrative Amazon Web Services business lines mean that the company’s spending budget will be no lower than it was in 2021. Meanwhile Meta seems content to ignore the wishes of shareholders and continue investing billions of dollars in its metaverse vision.

While the biggest tech companies have fallen out of favor with investors, this is different from what we saw for the companies and industries at the center of the storm in the early 2000s and 2008 recessions. In the early 2000s, the money dried up and tech companies went bankrupt, causing a cascade of job losses and hard times for companies when they were still dependent on investors to fund growing (but cash-burning) businesses. In 2008 there was a domino effect of less home construction, falling home prices, job losses, foreclosures and bankruptcies. In both recessions companies laid off people not because they wanted to, but because they had to.

And while we’ve seen some forced layoffs at startups and cash-burning tech companies like Carvana Co. and Peloton Interactive Inc., that hasn’t materialized at the largest tech companies. Consensus estimates are that Alphabet will earn more than $80 billion in operating profit in 2023. Does it make sense for their long-term prospects to lay off 5,000 or 10,000 workers in order to protect profit margins and appease shareholders in the short term? Would that be wise in an environment where there is scrutiny of the business practices of the most powerful, profitable tech companies? Arguably no. And if the biggest tech companies aren’t doing mass layoffs it limits the broader economic fallout.

What this means is that rather than slower business conditions triggering a surge in unemployment, the bigger risk for investors is a plunge in profit margins as companies slow or stall their spending plans without making significant cuts — the “job-full recession” scenario. And then as demand bounces back, companies will find themselves adequately staffed to meet that growth, hopefully allowing profit margins to bounce back quickly without the need for all the hiring we’ve seen over the past two years.

So the Fed shouldn’t expect a rapid deterioration in the labor market. We’re used to economic soft patches where workers bear the burden of the adjustment. This time it’s profit margins that are taking the hit.

The Government has not ruled out giving cash rebates to Aussies as households brace for higher energy bills.

Last week’s Budget forecast a 50 per cent increase to energy bills over the next two years, with the Treasury estimating a 20 per cent increase in late 2022 and a further 30 per cent hike in 2023-2024.

Now the Government is considering what its options are, including cash rebates for households.

“You can go down the path of direct support to households,” Treasurer Jim Chalmers told ABC’s Insiders.

“We don't want to rule out those kinds of options.”

But Chalmers said regulation, not cash handouts, was the priority.

The Government is looking at making a mandatory code of conduct for gas companies and making it more focused on “meaningful offers” for consumers.

Chalmers said the Government was considering including a price cap in that mandatory code and said the Government “don’t want to limit our options or narrow them down excessively”.

Chalmers couldn’t say when Aussies’ power bills would come down.

“We know that they will moderate in time,” the Treasurer said.

“We are always recalibrating our expectations for electricity price rises.”

What government rebates are on offer?

While no federal rebates have been announced, there are a range of state and territory rebates on offer.

For instance, NSW offers energy rebates of up to $180 for eligible families receiving the Family Tax Benefit and rebates of up to $200 for eligible seniors with a Commonwealth Seniors Health Card. You can use the NSW Savings Finder to find rebates relevant to you.

In Victoria, households can get a one-off $250 Power Saving Bonus when they visit the Victorian Energy Compare website .

In Queensland, households received a $175 cost-of-living rebate.

The rebate was automatically credited to eligible customer accounts and should appear on bills between September and November 2022, depending on your billing cycle.

But another option would be cash rebates.

“You can go down the path of direct support to households,” Treasurer Jim Chalmers said on ABC’s Insiders.

“We don’t want to rule out those kinds of options.”

Several state governments have operated rebate programs in recent months as the war in Ukraine takes a toll on energy supply.

Victorians have been able to access a $250 payment for seeking out a better deal, while vulnerable residents in New South Wales can receive assistance of up to $1600 a year and Queenslanders received a $175 rebate.

But the more likely action the federal government would take is a price cap on gas.

Cash handouts would likely do more harm in the long run given they would drive up inflation.

The annual inflation rate is currently 7.3 per cent and is tipped to peak at 7.75 per cent in the December quarter.

Instead, the government has indicated that it’s open to intervening in the energy market.

“We will not stand by and watch this flow through to the Australian people without taking action,” Energy Minister Chris Bowen said.

“We’ve agreed that we all have levers at our disposal and we intend to carefully (and) methodically use those levers wherever it puts downward pressure on prices.”

A cap price on gas would regulate how much companies could charge for their products.

The price of gas is forecast to rise by 40 per cent and power bills by 56 per cent, meaning capping the price of gas could drive those figures down.

“We are contemplating the kinds of steps that governments wouldn’t have contemplated a year or two ago,” Chalmers told reporters.

“You can go down the path of tax, you can go down the path of direct support to households, we don’t want to rule out those kinds of options, but our immediate focus is on the regulatory side.”

Other measures could include a mandatory code of conduct for gas companies.

While the code had been concerned with supply levels of gas, the treasurer said it could also extend to prices.

“We don’t really want to limit our options or narrow our options,” he said.

“There’s a lot of working going on behind the scenes, a lot of consultation and collaboration, and if there’s something sensible and responsible and meaningful we can do here, obviously, we will consider that.”

Bruce Mountain, the inaugural Director of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre at Victoria University, said Australians could expect to see their power bills double over the coming year.

“Australians haven’t seen a fraction of what’s coming,” he told 7NEWS.com.au.

It would take “spectacular” circumstances for prices to come back down, he said.

“We honestly don’t know how long it will be until prices begin to normalise,” Mountain said.

“I’ve seen some speculation it could be years, but we just don’t know.”

The war in Ukraine is placing significant strain on global supply and Mountain said that a resolution, or at least a clearer idea of where the conflict is heading, would stabilise the market.

Alternatively, if other supply sources emerged, a normalisation in prices could occur “quite quickly”.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese took a pledge to slash power bills by $275 into the federal election, basing it in large part on a plan to transition to cleaner energy."

3071b7c8-9130-41b7-abaf-39bc719e5c63,"The Bank of Japan has kept ultra-low interest rates and maintained its dovish guidance, cementing its status as an outlier among global central banks tightening monetary policy, as recession fears dampen prospects for a solid recovery.

The central bank also announced on Friday plans to increase the frequency of its bond buying next month, doubling down on efforts to defend its ultra-loose monetary policy.

BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said Japan was making some progress toward achieving his 2 per cent inflation target, as rising prices heighten the chance more firms will increase wages next year.

But he said the central bank was nowhere near raising interest rates, with inflation likely to fall short of its 2 per cent target for years to come.

""We expect wages to gradually rise reflecting recent inflation,"" Kuroda told a news conference. ""For now, we don't expect inflation to stably and sustainably achieve 2 per cent inflation next fiscal year.""

As widely expected, the BOJ left unchanged its -0.1 per cent target for short-term interest rates and a pledge to guide the 10-year bond yield around 0 per cent under its yield curve control (YCC) policy.

The central bank also maintained its dovish guidance projecting that short- and long-term rates will remain at ""present or lower levels.""

The yen fell against the US dollar in the aftermath of the BOJ's decision, and later extended its losses to hit a session high of 147.36 on Kuroda's dovish comments.

The BOJ's decision to maintain ultra-low rates also pushed Japan's 10-year bond yield to its lowest in nearly four weeks.

Kuroda brushed aside the view the BOJ's yield cap was to blame for the yen's recent sharp declines, reinforcing expectations he won't use rate hikes as a tool to slow the currency's falls.

""He's still basically wedded to the current policy settings of the BOJ,"" Alvin Tan, head of Asia FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets in Singapore. ""It's basically telegraphing to the world that he's not going to change tack anytime soon.""

Despite Kuroda's dovish tone, the BOJ upgraded its inflation forecasts and said price risks were skewed to the upside.

In fresh quarterly projections, the BOJ revised up its core consumer inflation forecast to 2.9 per cent for the year ending in March 2023. That is higher than a 2.3 per cent estimate made in July and well above the central bank's 2 per cent target.

The BOJ also upgraded its inflation forecasts to 1.6 per cent for both fiscal 2023 and 2024, in a nod to recent evidence that companies are actively passing on rising raw material costs to households.

""Our new price forecasts have put increased weight on the chance Japan will see higher inflation accompanied by wage hikes,"" Kuroda said. ""We're getting closer towards stably and sustainably hitting our price target. But we're not there yet.""

In a sign of its concern over global recession fears, however, the BOJ cut its economic growth forecasts for fiscal 2022 and 2023.

While more modest than other major economies, Japan's core consumer inflation hit an eight-year high of 3% in September, exceeding the BOJ's 2% target for six straight months.

The BOJ's ultra-easy policy has helped trigger sharp yen declines that inflate the cost of importing already expensive fuel and raw materials, prompting the government to intervene in the market to prop up the currency."

Changes to credit scores in the housing market

The U.S. mortgage market is effectively nationalized, with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac direct wards of the state and purchasing nearly all newly originated mortgage loans.

Now, the federal government has directed Fannie and Freddie to make use of alternative credit scores, which may well affect someone you know who is looking to buy a home.

On Oct. 27, Freddie Mac said the average interest rate on a fixed 30-year mortgage loan in the U.S. was 7.08%, up from 3.14% a year earlier.

But with all the talk about a possible recession, some mortgage bankers expect loan rates to drop in 2023. Here’s how far rates may fall.

Tech giants are seeing less advertising revenue, but traditional ad agencies haven't been hit as hard, suggesting industry-specific troubles.

The New York Stock Exchange's senior market strategist explained how the market could react to tech earnings.

Big Tech stocks have stumbled this week after reporting downbeat earnings, and a valuation reset could be looming as traders digest weakness in the sector, according to New York Stock Exchange senior market strategist Michael Reinking.

While Meta, Alphabet, and Microsoft have reported similar slowdowns in digital advertising growth over the last quarter, traditional ad agencies like IPG and Publicis have reported reasonably positive results, suggesting obstacles are related specifically to Big Tech, he noted.

""It's clear that there are headwinds for the industry after a period of unsustainable growth coming out of the pandemic, IOS privacy changes, growing competition and macro headwinds,"" Reinking told Insider.

Shares of Meta shed 20% early Thursday as the Facebook parent gave a weak revenue forecast late Wednesday, wiping off $67 billion from its market capitalization, according to Reuters.

On Tuesday, Google parent Alphabet reported an unexpected slowdown in digital-ad growth, with execs blaming the challenging economic landscape.

Also on Tuesday, Microsoft posted its weakest quarterly sales growth in five years thanks to a soaring dollar and cratering ad revenue.

""Many of the mega-cap stocks have traded lower, but we aren't necessarily trading to new lows,"" Reinking said. ""These stocks broadly trade at premium valuations to the market, which suggests there may need to be some valuation reset.""

In his view, predictions heading into the third-quarter earnings season mirrored the low expectations of last quarter. Analysts thought companies would slash guidance during the second quarter, but it didn't happen then and it has yet to happen now.

""This quarter has made it clear that investors are now screaming for financial discipline from these companies after a period of aggressive hiring and spending,"" Reinking said."

By Amruta Khandekar and Shreyashi Sanyal

Oct 27 (Reuters) - The Dow jumped on Thursday after a slew of upbeat earnings reports and data showing a rebound in economic growth eased some nerves about a recession, while the Nasdaq was pressured by a slump in Meta shares.

Gains in McDonald's and Caterpillar lifted the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average, in which the share value of a stock is proportional to its influence on the index as opposed to the market capitalization-weighted S&P 500 .

Caterpillar Inc jumped 8.2% on posting a rise in third-quarter profit, while McDonald's Corp added 3.1% on beating quarterly comparable sales estimates.

Merck & Co Inc rose 2.1% and Honeywell International Inc climbed 4.4% as both the companies reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings.

Facebook-parent Meta Platforms Inc slumped 22.1%, putting it on course to lose about $77 billion in market value, as it reported a drop in third-quarter profit and forecast a weak holiday quarter.

The S&P 500 communication services sector tumbled 3.1% and was the biggest loser on the index.

The U.S. Commerce Department's advance third-quarter gross domestic product report showed GDP increased at a 2.6% annualized rate last quarter, ending two straight quarterly decreases in output.

The GDP report followed a string of recent data showing shrinking business activity and a fall in consumer sentiment, that had boosted hopes that the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hikes were beginning to slow the economy and the central bank could soon tone down its hawkish stance.

Story continues

""For every kind of (report) you put in the column and say the Fed has more room to raise rates, there's enough on the other side to show that the Fed probably needs to slow down,"" said Ken Mahoney, chief executive officer of Mahoney Asset Management in Montvale, New Jersey.

""The 2.6% headline number today was a relief to a lot of investors to say, maybe there is a chance of a soft landing.""

The Fed is set to increase interest rates by 75 basis points in an upcoming meeting next week, with traders betting on a 50 basis point raise in December.

Data scheduled for Friday is expected show the Fed's preferred measure of inflation continued to run at roughly three times the U.S. central bank's annual target last month.

Shares of Amazon.com Inc were down 4.0%, while Apple Inc fell 2.8% ahead of results later on Thursday.

At 12:55 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 322.17 points, or 1.01%, at 32,161.28, the S&P 500 was down 7.91 points, or 0.21%, at 3,822.69, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 124.88 points, or 1.14%, at 10,846.11.

dcde8fd6-21e2-45e1-810b-3655776bfde5,"About $29.8bn worth of fixed rate mortgages will expire by the end of the year, which will mean an extra $641 in monthly repayments for homeowners by Christmas, as the Reserve Bank of Australia looks set to deliver even more bad news.

The RBA is tipped to confirm its seventh consecutive rate rise on Tuesday, but Finder’s consumer sentiment tracker in October showed 30 per cent of homeowners were already struggling to pay their home loan each month.

The comparison website has analysed data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and says many low fixed rates will expire into variable interest rates of more than five per cent over the next 12 months.

On an average loan size of $509,422 that means a $906 increase in monthly repayments by the end of next year.

Finder’s latest RBA cash rate survey has also revealed 38 out of 39 experts and economists believe the rate will change on Tuesday, with 35 of them forecasting another increase of 25 basis points.

Camera Icon The RBA is tipped to confirm its seventh consecutive rate rise on Tuesday. NCA Newswire/Gaye Gerard Credit: News Corp Australia

That would bring the cash rate to 2.85 per cent in November.

Almost half of the experts agreed with the move, but one in five disagreed with any increase and said the RBA should hold the cash rate.

“The forecasts from the bond-yield curve models I estimated consistently indicate an increase in the value of the cash rate until mid-2023, after which levelling off should follow,” Tomasz Wozniak, from the University of Melbourne, said.

“By that time, the cash rate will nearly surely be higher than 3.6 per cent, will most likely reach four per cent, and is unlikely to exceed 4.4 per cent.

“This would mean that the interest rates might get to the levels from early 2012.”

Finder head of consumer research Graham Cooke said a seventh consecutive rate hike would be a tough burden for many households.

“The current series of rate hikes has added almost $9000 to the annual cost of a $500,000 mortgage,” he said.

“Another 25 basis point hike will push that cost up to near $10,000.

“The RBA has been crystal clear that its top priority is to tamp down inflation. After six hikes, inflation is at a 30-year high. More rate rises are likely on the way.”

Finder research further revealed 70 per cent of homeowners — or 4.1 million households — would not be able to afford their mortgage repayments if there was another rate hike before Christmas.

Nine per cent said they would have to sell their property, while three per cent said they would default on their mortgage.

“The prospect of one more interest rate spike is just too much to manage for millions of households causing many to go to extreme lengths,” Mr Cooke said.

“Remember it’s not too late to find a better home loan deal.

“Refinancing can dramatically lower your costs – mortgage holders could save thousands of dollars a year.”"

Borrowers have already been forced to contend with six consecutive monthly interest rate rises since May, with a seventh straight increase in November regarded as a near certainty.

This is despite Australian home owners enduring the steepest pace of rate rises in almost three decades.

What a 0.25 percentage point rate rise would mean $500,000: Up $75 to $2,621 $600,000: Up $90 to $3,145 $700,000: Up $105 to $3,669 $800,000: Up $120 to $4,193 $900,000: Up $135 to $4,717 $1,000,000: Up $150 to $5,241 Monthly repayment increases based on a Commonwealth Bank variable loan rising to 4.79 per cent from 4.54 per cent to reflect Reserve Bank of Australia cash rate rising to 2.85 per cent from 2.6 per cent Advertisement !- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/au/news/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - ->

For someone paying off an average $600,000 mortgage, that will mean a $90 increase in their monthly mortgage repayments to $3,145.

Westpac, however, is predicting an even bigger 0.5 percentage point increase that would take the RBA cash rate to a new 10-year high of 3.1 per cent.

This same borrower with a $600,000 variable mortgage would see their monthly repayments rise by another $181 to $3,236.

That is based on a popular Commonwealth Bank variable rate rising to 5.04 per cent, up from an existing level of 4.54 per cent.

Should rates increase by 50 basis points, a borrower with a $600,000 loan would have seen their mortgage repayments rise by $930 since early May, when the RBA cash rate was still at 0.1 per cent.

Just six months ago, Commonwealth Bank variable loans charged 2.29 per cent interest and monthly repayments were at $2,306.

RateCity research director Sally Tindall said a bigger 0.5 percentage point rate rise in November would be more effective in tackling inflation but came with economic risks.

'Reverting back to half a percentage point hike would get the job done faster, however, it also has the capacity to tip more overindebted families into financial stress,' she said.

'With such a precarious and uncertain path ahead, the RBA may need to change tack at any time.'

Scott Solomon, a Baltimore-based associate portfolio manager with American asset management group T. Rowe Price Associates, said Reserve Bank Governor Philip Lowe didn't want to jeopardise Australia's near 48-year low unemployment rate with a bigger rate rise.

'We expect the Reserve Bank of Australia to stick to the plan and hike 25 basis points at the November meeting,' he said.

'Furthermore, he's quite proud of the levels of employment reached by the Australian economy and has zero desire to prematurely destroy that.'

Many borrowers fixed their loans at a low 2 per cent rate in late 2020 and 2021 when the RBA cash rate was still at a record-low of 0.1 per cent.

Mr Solomon said Dr Lowe would be particularly concerned about these borrowers at their ultra-low two-year fixed-rate periods expired.

'He's acutely aware that many mortgages are due to reset over the next couple of months and doesn't want to unnecessarily burden the population,' he said.

The pace of Reserve Bank monetary policy tightening is already the most severe since 1994, with the central bank opting for 0.5 percentage point increases in June, July, August and September.

A seventh consecutive monthly rate rise on November 1 would be the most in a row since the RBA began publishing a target cash rate in 1990.

The 30-day interbank futures market is expecting a 0.25 percentage point rate rise on Tuesday, matching October's quarter of a percentage point increase.

Westpac is the most worried about inflation with the bank's chief economist Bill Evans forecasting the RBA cash rate peaking at an 11-year high of 3.85 per cent by March 2023.

The 30-day interbank futures is expecting a 0.25 percentage point rate rise on Tuesday, matching October's quarter of a percentage point increase

ANZ's head of Australian economics David Plank is also expecting a 3.85 per cent cash rate but in May.

The Commonwealth Bank's head of Australian economics Gareth Aird is expecting a 3.1 per cent cash rate peak in December, when the Reserve Bank raises rates by another quarter of a percentage point.

NAB chief economist Alan Oster has updated his forecasts to have the Reserve Bank cash rate peaking at 3.6 per cent in March next year, but regards a 0.5 percentage point increase in November as a outside chance with the 7.3 per cent headline inflation rate more than double the RBA's 2 to 3 per cent target.

'In these circumstances, the RBA will need to move monetary policy into more clearly restrictive territory to ensure inflation returns to target,' he said.

'We see a 25 basis point move as likely, but a 50 basis point rise in November is possible.'

The Treasury Budget papers forecast inflation in the December quarter of 2022 hitting a new 32-year high of 7.75 per cent as a return to the old fuel excise rate of 44.2 cents a litre led to higher consumer prices.

The Bank of Canada last week raised its cash rate by 50 basis points to 3.75 per cent while the European Central Bank increased its equivalent rate by 75 basis points to 1.5 per cent - the highest since 2009.

But KPMG chief economist Brendan Rynne said despite those developments, a 25 basis point rise was more likely on Tuesday with an outside chance of a 50 basis point increase.

'Given those developments at home and abroad, a double-rate rise is certainly possible, but KPMG maintains the view that a 25 basis point increase is likely at the November and December RBA board meetings, taking the cash rate to 3.1 per cent by the end of the year,' he said."

Banks are expected to tighten mortgage lending for UK property as they battle higher interest rates, a riskier economic outlook, and volatility in the markets.

The forecast for mortgage lending in Britain is set to grow 4% this year, but slow to just 0.7% in 2023 thanks to rising interest rates and a fall in real income.

According to EY’s Item Club Outlook for financial Services, this will be the lowest level since 2011 in the aftermath of the financial crisis.

Demand for consumer credit is expected to rise 7.2% this year, as cost of living and inflationary pressures deepen. But this high rate is not expected to be sustained, and as inflation falls back and the squeeze on households’ real incomes eases, the growth rate is predicted to slow to 5.1% in 2023.

This represents a reversal of the pandemic period when demand fell more than 10%.

Meanwhile, bank-to-business lending is also forecast to grow 2.2% this year but fall 3.5% in 2023 as appetite and ability for UK businesses to invest is affected by the deteriorating economic outlook and rising interest rates.

This would be the first decline in six years, but less severe than the average annual fall of 7.2% between 2009 and 2012 during and after the financial crisis.

Watch: How does inflation affect interest rates?

In contrast to 2021, when many UK businesses focused on paying back pandemic debt, this year has seen a return to growth in borrowing, particularly by large corporates, the data showed.

But average growth of 2.4% in the eight months to August was low by pre-pandemic standards, where annual growth averaged 5.2% over 2018 and 2019.

It comes as overall housing market activity has remained fairly buoyant this year, in part as buyers looked to lock-in low rate deals, with mortgage lending forecast to to £63bn in net terms.

Real incomes are also set for the biggest annual decline since the 1970s.

“Geopolitics and the worsening economic environment are having a significant impact on households and businesses. While interest rates are still fairly low by historic standards, they are the highest they’ve been in a decade and are set to rise further,” Anna Anthony, UK financial services managing partner at EY, said.

“This will put further pressure on already-strained finances and will have a knock-on effect on demand for most forms of bank lending next year, as potential homeowners postpone purchases and businesses pause investment.

He added: “Affordability is stretched and mortgage and business lending are likely to slow to a rate similar to that seen post-financial crisis. The key difference now is that tighter regulation and higher solvency levels mean banks are well capitalised and far more able to support customers through this challenging period.

“Another crucial difference is that many consumers are entering this period with a financial cushion in the form of savings built up during the pandemic, and businesses that took out government-guaranteed loan schemes during COVID-19 remain on fixed rate terms at relatively low interest rates.

“This all means that consumers and businesses are better positioned than they were over a decade ago, and the banks better able to support them.”

Meanwhile, EY said it does not expect levels to exceed the peaks recorded in the financial crisis, as tighter regulation and savings will help cushion the impact for consumers, while for businesses who took on debt during the pandemic, low interest, fixed rate government-guaranteed loan schemes will help keep repayments manageable.

Impairments on mortgage loans are forecast to rise from 0.02% in 2022 to a nine-year high of 0.05% next year. This remains below the peak of 0.08% reached in 2009. In 2024 it is forecast to fall to 0.04%.

Write-off rates on personal loans and credit cards are predicted to be 1.9% this year, rising to 2.5% next – the highest level since 2012, albeit half the 5% peak reached in 2010. In 2024 write-offs are forecast to fall to 2.2%.

Impairments on business loans are forecast to reach 0.7% in 2023, approaching double the previous year’s 0.4%. But again, this would still be a long way short of rates of 1%-1.5% in the early 2010s. In 2024 impairments are forecast to drop back to 0.4%.

The Bank of England is supposed to exude confidence, strength and permanence.

Its domineering building in the heart of the City looks like something between a fortress and a classical temple, designed to withstand both storms and centuries.

Andrew Bailey, the Governor of the Bank, will now need to channel every ounce of the institution’s reputation as he prepares to set interest rates next week.

Recession is on the way. GDP started shrinking in August and is set to keep falling into next year. Meanwhile, homeowners and would-be buyers are frozen in fear.

A debt market panic in the wake of Kwasi Kwarteng’s mini-Budget saw mortgage products pulled from sale without warning then returned at interest rates not seen since before the financial crisis.

Rishi Sunak is still in the midst of his own U-turns as he starts to unpick the plans of his predecessor, Liz Truss.

The average rate of a two-year fixed-rate mortgage currently sits at about 6.5pc, comparable with rates in 2008. And according to recent data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), around a third of people who are paying rent or mortgage payments have seen their payments go up in the last six months.

Raising rates by 0.75 percentage points equates to an extra £85 of repayments per month - just over £1,000 per year - for a borrower with a £200,000 mortgage. This will affect new buyers and those with variable rate mortgages first, as well as owners whose fixed-term loans are up for remortgaging.

Meanwhile inflation has been getting worse.

At 10.1pc last month, prices are rising at more than five-times the Bank of England’s 2pc annual target.

This poses a series of dilemmas for Bailey and his colleagues at Threadneedle Street. Acting to control inflation with higher rates will worsen the recession and crush homeowners.

Higher borrowing costs will worsen the Government’s financial predicament as debt servicing costs are already spiralling on its £2.4 trillion national debt.

Yet failing to act strongly enough to get on top of price rises risks undermining confidence in Britain’s institutions while letting inflation sap the economy’s strength in the years to come.

On top of that, Bailey and the other members of the nine-strong Monetary Policy Committee are “flying blind”, says Marco Valli at UniCredit, because they do not know what the Government is planning.

Jeremy Hunt, Kwarteng’s successor as Chancellor, has moved his Autumn Statement from October 31 - three days before the MPC’s meeting on Thursday - to November 17.

All the while financial markets are shifting rapidly. Bond yields are dropping, the pound is rising and mortgage rates are tentatively edging down in the crucial weeks when the Bank’s economists are trying to build a comprehensive picture of the state of the economy on which to base their interest rate decisions.

George Buckley, economist at Nomura, calls the volatility and political turmoil “a nightmare” for the Bank.

It is also a nightmare for anyone trying to buy or sell a house, as mortgages shift before their eyes.

So what can the Bank do about it?

Its first challenge is to work out what to do about fiscal policy. Since September, when the Bank raised rates from 1.75pc to 2.25pc, the Government has announced sweeping tax cuts funded by higher borrowing, then, after a change of Chancellor and Prime Minister, reversed almost all of those.

Ministers have hinted at more tax increases or spending cuts to come.

Unfortunately for Bailey, the Bank does not traditionally make political guesses and sets interest rates based on announced Government policy.

This means Hunt’s U-turns will be included, but extra expected spending cuts in the Autumn Statement will not.

Energy policy is particularly important. Liz Truss’s two-year scheme to lower energy bills was expected to cap inflation from October, easing the Bank’s job. That is now up for review after six months. The aim will be to cut the cost to the public purse, and so potentially allow inflation to pick up again. However, no details have been confirmed.

Asked by MPs if he anticipates being briefed on the fiscal plans, Sir Jon Cunliffe, a deputy governor said that given “the Chancellor has underlined the importance of working with the Bank, I would expect that to happen”.

Talks between the Treasury and Bank are particularly frequent at the moment, given recent chaos.

It opens the possibility of the Bank entering uncharted territory, considering the guidance when making its forecasts even before fiscal policy has been set in stone.

This could provide some relief for mortgage borrowers. If the Bank expects tighter fiscal policy, for instance through lower Government spending, it may limit its increases in interest rates.

Martin Weale, a former member of the MPC and now a professor at King’s College London, says the Bank usually “looks through” the impact of tax changes such as VAT on inflation.

In a similar vein, this time it could choose to ignore the higher inflation caused by a change to the energy price guarantee - though this is muddied by the risk that an extra peak in inflation next year may embed price rises through more of the economy.

Bailey and other MPC members have also expressed their own worries that persistent inflation will lead to more demand for higher wages, in turn stoking more inflation.

So how far should the MPC raise interest rates? Financial markets expect the Bank to make its biggest upward move since Black Wednesday in 1992 with an increase from 2.25pc to 3pc.

Economists are split over whether this is enough.

Weale urges caution. “I would be advocating moving slightly cautiously in November, and making clear that if necessary further adjustments could be made in December,” he says, allowing the Bank to take the Autumn Statement into account at that stage.

“I would not be totally amazed if the MPC settled again for 0.5 percentage points,” rather than the 0.75 expected by markets.

Allan Monks, economist at JP Morgan, similarly thinks there is a change of a half-point move, particularly as Ben Broadbent, a deputy governor at the Bank, recently called the rise in market expectations “very dramatic”.

A smaller rate rise could be justified, Monks says, as an end to the energy price guarantee in April means “a real income drag for next year compared to the Truss energy plan”, harming the economy’s growth prospects.

Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics suggests an alternative path, raising rates by 0.75 percentage points then talking down future rate increases “to imply that the MPC will not eventually raise Bank Rate all the way to the 5pc level” predicted by traders last week - though over the past month this forecast peak has ranged from 6.25pc down to 4.75pc, in a mark of market volatility.

Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, by contrast, says the Bank knows that it needs to go further in the months ahead so might as well show it is serious about tackling price rises.

“I think they are going to try to focus more on inflation, especially because they had to postpone quantitative tightening,” she says, referring to the sale of bonds bought under quantitative easing which the Bank is belatedly starting on November 1, having delayed the scheme due to the panic in pensions a month ago.

“Therefore we could easily see a one percentage point increase in rates.”

This might sound bad for homeowners, but she thinks the Bank can go hard now then stop raising rates sooner, suggesting a peak of 4.5pc in February.

This would spare mortgage borrowers from the 4.75pc markets anticipated by the end of last week.

Whichever figure the MPC picks, it will not be the end of this dizzying run of sharp rate rises.

Balancing these competing arguments is Bailey’s troublesome task. Satisfying everyone will be impossible.

Homeowners will have to hope he simply chooses not to shock anyone, electing to be as dull, solid and dependable as possible as the best option at the end of a month of chaos.

Aussies need to prepare for yet another interest rate hike when the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) board meets next week.

This month’s Finder RBA Cash Rate Survey found almost all panelists (97 per cent) believed the cash rate would change on Tuesday, with 90 per cent forecasting another 0.25 per cent hike.

This would bring the cash rate to 2.85 per cent - up from 0.1 per cent in April.

Finder head of consumer research Graham Cooke said a seventh consecutive rate hike would be a tough burden for many households.

“The current series of rate hikes has added almost $9,000 to the annual cost of a $500,000 mortgage,” Cooke said.

“Another 25-basis-point hike will push that cost up to near $10,000.”

Cooke added that households should be prepared for even more rate hikes going into next year.

“The RBA has been crystal clear that its top priority is to tamp down inflation,” he said.

“After six hikes, inflation is at a 30-year high. More rate rises are likely on the way.”

Mortgage holders already struggling

Many Aussies with mortgages are already struggling to get by with the current rate hikes, Finder found.

Almost three quarters of Australians (70 per cent) said they couldn’t afford their mortgage repayments if there was another rate hike before Christmas.

That’s the equivalent of 4.1 million households who would have to make changes to their finances with just one more rate rise.

On top of that, 9 per cent (roughly 500,000 people) said they’d have to sell their property if hit with another hike.

A further 3 per cent admitted they would default on their mortgage if their interest rate went any higher.

Cooke said rapidly increasing interest rates would have dire consequences for Aussie households.

“The prospect of one more interest rate spike is just too much to manage for millions of households, causing many to go to extreme lengths,” Cooke said.

Markets await the next Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee meeting next week, which is anticipated to result in a 75 basis point hike in the base rate as longer term expectations for interest rates fall amid calming waters for UK Government bonds.

But experts warn the alarming rise in mortgage rates in recent weeks has worsened the outlook for recession, with the potential for a housing crash exacerbating the economic woes facing Britain.

© Provided by This Is Money The Bank of England is expected to hike interest rates by 75bps to 3 per cent next week

A sharp fall in gilt yields since the initial turmoil of September's mini-Budget may provide some respite, with the Bank of England signalling interest rates may peak far below market expectations - but they still remain well above levels seen in the summer.

In the wake of Chancellor Jeremy Hunt's screeching U-turn on much of the mini-budget, the average fixed rate for two-year and five-year fixed mortgages across all loan-to-values climbed to 6.53 and 6.36 per cent, according to Moneyfacts.

The last time the average two-year fixed rate mortgage hit 6.4 per cent or more was back in August 2008 during the fallout from the global financial crash, when it reached 6.94 per cent.

The BoE recently warned that 800,000 households will be unable to pay their mortgages next year, the highest since the 2008 financial crisis, as they struggle to deal with rising rates. Just a year ago, the average mortgage rate was 2.35 per cent.

Feeding this rise, markets were forecasting the base rate to go as high as 5.25 per cent next year before BoE Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent stepped in to calm expectations.

'If the bank rate really were to reach 5.25 per cent… the cumulative impact on GDP of the entire hiking cycle would be just under 5 cent - of which only around one quarter has already come through,' he said in a speech in London.

'It would imply a pretty material hit to demand over the next couple of years.'

Markets now expect the BoE to hike rates by 75bps to 3 per cent at its 3 November MPC meeting, having previously expected a 100bps rise, as it attempts to bring inflation down from its 40-year high of 10.1 per cent.

The BoE's hiking cycle is now anticipated to peak below 5 per cent.

While this move has softened risk, European economist at T. Rowe Price Tomasz Wieladek said a house price crash and a recession were now 'inevitable'.

'A BoE policy rate at 4 per cent implies a two-year mortgage rate of 5 to 6 per cent. Even before this rapid rise in mortgage rates became a reality, forward looking indicators implied a significant slowdown in house price growth.'

It comes as consumer confidence, which is also a key indicator of house purchasing demand, plummeted to record lows in the third quarter of 2020, according to the Deloitte Consumer Tracker. Meanwhile, house price growth is slowing.

Wieladek added: 'The large rise in mortgage rates, together with the decline in real disposable income, will exacerbate the trends in the housing market.'

UK recession outlook

In its most recent quarterly monetary policy report in August, the Bank of England forecast that the UK is to enter five consecutive quarters of recession beginning in October.

At the time, the BoE said GDP will decline by nearly 1 per cent in the fourth quarter of this year.

But while longer term inflation expectations have softened in the time since the report, other issues have intensified.

The S&P/CIPS Composite PMI index, published on Monday, shows a sharp retraction in business activity in October to a 21-month low.

Thomas Pugh, economist at RSM UK, said the reading 'reinforces other evidence that the economy is in a recession'.

He added: 'We expect the recession to last until Q3 2023 and result in a drop in GDP of around 2 per cent.'

City forecasts compiled by the Treasury in October, but before more recent data was published, show an average full-year 2023 GDP expectation for a decline of just 0.3 per cent.

He added: 'It is a reason why the UK may have a deeper recession than most other countries.

'There's about £1.6trillion worth of mortgage debt out there - if even about 40 per cent of that has to refinance over the next year… and it is going to be paying 300bps more than it was before, that's about one percentage point off GDP that is going to come out of household consumption elsewhere.

'And that's before you have the knock-on wealth effects and confidence effects from falling housing prices, for example. So this could be pretty significant.

'If mortgage rates are going to settle around 5 or 6 per cent, that's going to be a really significant hit to consumption next year.

'If they settle at 3 or 4 per cent, it's going to be negative, but not of the magnitude [of 5-6 per cent], which looks like a really deep recession.'"

ZURICH/NEW YORK (Reuters) - After months of reflecting, Credit Suisse's chairman Axel Lehmann revealed an overhaul ""to rebuild Credit Suisse as a strong ... bank with a firm foundation, rock-solid like our Swiss mountains"". It did not take long for the first cracks to appear.

The announcement of the blueprint early on Thursday triggered a sell-off in the bank's stock that lobbed more than 2 billion Swiss francs ($2 billion) off its market worth, almost a fifth of its value, taking its worth to less than 11 billion Swiss francs.

""You come away with the feeling that they were rushed ... with a deeply incomplete plan,"" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote to their clients in a note seen by Reuters, adding that the bank's plan was ""short on detail"".

Such sentiment was echoed elsewhere. ""A lot of detail is lacking still,"" said Johann Scholtz, an analyst with Morningstar.

Unusually, Swiss regulator FINMA too struck a guarded tone, saying it would keep close tabs on the bank as it rolls out its plan.

""It is clear that FINMA will continue to monitor that all the supervisory requirements are met during the implementation phase of the new strategy,"" it told Reuters.

On Thursday, Credit Suisse outlined plans to raise 4 billion Swiss francs from investors, cut thousands of jobs and shift its focus from investment banking towards its rich clients.

The announcement followed a difficult few weeks when the one-time respected Swiss institution had even become a 'meme stock' at the centre of a social media storm.

Credit Suisse said its clients pulled funds in recent weeks at a pace that led the lender to breach some regulatory requirements for liquidity, underscoring the deep impact of wild market swings and social media speculation about its health.

Asked about this, FINMA said: ""It is clear that a credible plan must exist for how the buffers can be replenished within a reasonable period.""

CREDIT SUISSE'S PLAN

The bank's turnaround plan is long-winded and complex.

Its chairman Lehmann sought to bring it to the point. ""We need to remember our origins and return to the core of our business,"" he told analysts, referring to its wealth management business.

In its bid to restore profitability after a string of scandals and losses, the bank will cut its workforce by roughly 9,000 to about 43,000 by the end of 2025.

It will separate its investment bank to create CS First Boston, focused on advisory work such as mergers and acquisitions and arranging deals on capital markets. It intends to sell off risky investments.

The bank aims to reach a return on tangible equity - a key measure of profitability - of 6% by 2025, a metric that lags its peers and may be hard to reach because of the risk associated with the restructuring plan, according to analysts at Jefferies.

The lender also won the backing of Saudi National Bank, majority-owned by the government of Saudi Arabia, which will invest up to 1.5 billion Swiss francs to take a stake of up to 9.9%.

Harris Associates, one of the bank's biggest shareholders, was optimistic, welcoming the bank's ""aggressive"" approach to improving.

But the incomplete nature of the plan and dilution of existing shareholders drew criticism, including from Vincent Kaufmann, head of Ethos, which represents shareholders holding more than 3% of Credit Suisse stock.

""We are critical of the entry ... of a new strategic shareholder in view of the current valuation,"" he said. ""The new shareholder will obtain nearly 10% of the capital for only 1.5 billion francs.""

CREDIT SUISSE MUST 'DRAW A LINE'

The latest revamp, aiming to overcome the bank's worst crisis in its history, is the third attempt in recent years by successive CEOs to turn the group around.

""We all know we need to get this right,"" said Lehmann, admitting that the bank had disappointed many. ""We need to draw a line clearly.""

Once a symbol for Swiss reliability, the bank's reputation has been tarnished by a series of scandals, including an unprecedented prosecution at home involving laundering money for a criminal gang.

Last year, the bank took a $5.5 billion loss from the unravelling of U.S. investment firm Archegos and had to freeze $10 billion worth of supply chain finance funds linked to insolvent British financier Greensill, highlighting risk-management failings.

Its deepening problems even put it on the radar of day traders this month, when a frenzy of wild speculation about its health sent its stock price to a record low.

On Thursday, as the bank's shares tumbled, social media platforms such as Reddit or Twitter were largely silent.

But analysts and investors who spoke to Reuters expressed a sense of continued unease, with one shareholder, asking not be named, describing a ""bleak picture overall"".

""Execution of this is highly dependent on economic forces that are out of their control,"" said Chris Marinac, director of research at investment firm Janney Montgomery Scott.

""If we were in a great market, you could probably give the company some benefit of the doubt. But because it's Fall of 2022 and there's all this uncertainty ... it's really hard. And that's the pond that Credit Suisse is swimming in.""

(Reuters) - Credit Suisse's latest shake-up has led to the promotion of some senior executives to more powerful roles while others are leaving. The bank is significantly reducing its workforce, cutting overall headcount from around 52,000 at the end of the third quarter to 43,000 by the end of 2025.

Here is a list of the key people affected by the bank's latest revamp starting with those who are ""in"" and taking on more responsibilities and those who are ""out"" and no longer involved in its management.

IN:

MICHAEL KLEIN

A former Citigroup Inc dealmaker, Klein has been named adviser to Credit Suisse CEO Ulrich Körner. He will step down from the board of directors to take the helm of CS First Boston, acting as the unit's CEO designate.

The 59-year old American banker is no stranger to entrepreneurial projects. He launched his own advisory boutique, M. Klein & Company, in 2010 and worked on several high-profile deals including Saudi Aramco's listing in 2019.

MICHAEL EBERT

Ex-Bank of America Corp banker Ebert has been elevated to co-head of the markets business, reporting directly to Körner.

He was hired by former Credit Suisse boss Tidjane Thiam in 2017 to run equity derivatives globally. Based in New York, Ebert was elevated in July to lead the investment banking business with David Miller while the unit's former boss Christian Meissner was gradually sidelined.

KEN PANG

A key figure of Credit Suisse in Asia, Hong Kong-based banker Pang has been promoted to co-head the markets business with Ebert. He rose during the bank's latest reshuffle of its regional and divisional leaders in Asia Pacific in late 2021 and currently serves as co-head of global trading solutions and co-head of the investment bank for the Asia Pacific region.

FRANCESCO DE FERRARI

The Swiss and Italian national holds the keys of Credit Suisse's prized wealth-management business, where its strategic focus has shifted. The 53-year-old returned to Credit Suisse in January as CEO of its wealth-management division and interim CEO of Europe, Middle East and Africa after a stint leading Australian wealth management company AMP.

Story continues

His earlier career at Credit Suisse included periods as head of private banking in the Asia Pacific region and CEO of South East Asia and frontier markets. Between 2008 and 2011, De Ferrari was CEO of Credit Suisse's private banking in Italy.

LOUISE KITCHEN

A Deutsche Bank veteran, Kitchen quit the German bank last year to join Credit Suisse and will play a key role in its revamp by taking the helm of its Capital Release Unit (CRU) - a job that will report to Chief Financial Officer Dixit Joshi.

At Deutsche Bank she was already heading the capital release group and also served as a member of the group management committee. Before joining Deutsche Bank in 2005, she worked for UBS.

NITA PATEL

A former Goldman Sachs banker, Nita Patel is rising to a key position within the new Credit Suisse. She will become the bank's new chief compliance officer on Nov. 1 and will join the executive board, reporting directly to Körner.

Patel joined Credit Suisse last year and most recently served as chief compliance officer of the asset management division as well as the UK investment bank. She was also a member of various key business and compliance committees.

OUT:

CHRISTIAN MEISSNER

A former Bank of America executive, Meissner is leaving Credit Suisse without having had much of a say on the bank's strategic overhaul, according to one source. He joined Credit Suisse in 2020 as co-head of a new division which combined international wealth management and investment banking advisory.

The 53-year-old Austrian dealmaker was a key lieutenant to Credit Suisse's former boss Thomas Gottstein and was promoted last year to run the Swiss lender's entire investment banking activities.

In the midst of the pandemic Meissner became a board member of Swiss private bank Julius Baer but quit in October 2020 after only five months in the post to join Credit Suisse.

RAFAEL LOPEZ LORENZO

Another short-lived appointment in the history of Credit Suisse. The bank's chief compliance officer is leaving Credit Suisse after spending little more than a year in the post. He was a close ally of former chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio, one source said.

A Spanish national, Lopez Lorenzo joined Credit Suisse in 2015 from JPMorgan where he was a managing director in New York.

The 47-year-old banker was part of a new crop of executives who had been tasked to restore Credit Suisse's reputation after a series of scandals. Former boss Gottstein had combined compliance and risk functions under Lara Warner who was removed last year after the twin hits from Greensill Capital and Archegos Capital Management.

bbb756a2-5d4c-4547-9319-c23736cc8ba2,"Some bankers may be rattled by the upheaval and head for the exit, while others will leave involuntarily. Either way, Credit Suisse will look very different in two years’ time, and there will be individual winners and losers.

Still, the restructure announcement will deliver some relief, too. Credit Suisse’s local bankers haven’t exactly loved starting every client meeting for the last few months by providing reassurances their employer remains financially sound.

Chief executive Ulrich Korner’s turnaround plan should at least put those concerns to bed. Having downplayed talk of a capital raising for weeks, Credit Suisse surprised exactly no one (and made itself look a little silly) with the announcement of a capital raising equivalent to more than a third of the company’s market value, to be conducted at a historically weak share price.

Sum of the parts

Crucially, this will be supplemented by as-yet undisclosed proceeds of the sale of its securitised products group, which will be sold to a consortium led by US private equity group Apollo Management and US bond manager PIMCO, plus other sales of non-core assets. That might add another $US55 billion of capital.

Having effectively kitchen-sinked the capital issue, the question for the global banking market is whether Korner’s restructure can force the market to rerate Credit Suisse using an old-fashioned sum-of-the-parts approach.

Advertisement

After the inevitable share price fall that greeted Thursday night’s announcement of a capital raising, Credit Suisse had a market value of $US10 billion.

But by putting the investment bank in a separate vehicle, Korner would be hoping investors might eventually – eventually being very much the operative word here – see a business that looks broadly similar to other pure-play investment banks. Jefferies, which is valued at about $US8 billion on the New York Stock Exchange, would be a good example.

From there, Korner will be praying the markets reassess the value of the core bits of the “new” Credit Suisse: a large wealth management business, a strong and profitable Swiss bank, and an asset management unit with $US1.4 trillion under management.

Exactly what those three numbers are is obviously a matter of contention. But Korner will argue the sum of the parts is a fair way north of $US11 billion.

That’s the theory, anyway. The doubts after Korner’s presentation of the restructure on Thursday night quickly surfaced. Most were focused on the centrepiece of his plan, the radical investment banking restructure.

Will CS First Boston be able to retain its top bankers in this switch to a smaller investment bank that is designed to have about 40 per cent less assets? Will the investment bank be able to attract the funding it needs, including debt? How profitable will the investment bank actually be?

Advertisement

Korner told investors the entire Credit Suisse would be profitable from 2024, but there was widespread disappointment that he is targeting a return on tangible equity of just 6 per cent by 2025; that’s lower than the 8 per cent target Deutsche Bank set when it started its giant restructure in 2019.

Integrated model

Inside Credit Suisse Australia, there is relief that the “new” Credit Suisse will have wealth management and asset management at its core; while investment banking gets a lot of the public attention locally, the view inside Credit Suisse is that its local private banking franchise is one of the best in the country, and there is plenty of room for this business to grow in a very fragmented and arguably underserved market.

There is also confidence that Australia will remain a key market for the reconstructed group, given the new focus on developed markets and the outlook for a return to solid population growth in the coming years.

Still, the separation of the investment bank would appear to threaten or at least challenge what local boss Richard Gibb has publicly said is a great strength of Credit Suisse’s local offering: the integrated model that gives it the ability to serve local entrepreneurs and wealthy families as private bank clients, then offer them investment banking services when they come to buy, sell or list their assets.

Clearly, it will take some time before Credit Suisse investment bankers are set up in the new CS First Boston shop, and there will no doubt be mechanisms to maintain these familial links.

But the global restructure has clearly raised big questions about Credit Suisse’s key source of differentiation in a ferociously competitive investment banking market."
adebc1cf-7e2d-4121-98e4-cb40887daec6,"Credit Suisse Group opted to tap investors for a painful multibillion-dollar capital raise to shore up confidence and fund a years-long reshaping that will carve out its investment bank and slash its headcount by 9,000.

The stock closed 18.6 per cent lower on the firm’s plans to raise 4 billion francs ($6.2 billion) through a rights issue and selling shares to investors including the Saudi National Bank. It’s effectively breaking up the investment bank, separating the advisory and capital markets unit and selling the majority of a trading business to a group led by Apollo Global Management.

Credit Suisse is cutting its workforce by 17 per cent over the next three years. Credit:Bloomberg

The moves mark an urgent attempt to restore credibility at Credit Suisse after a succession of big losses and management chaos shattered its status as one of Europe’s most prestigious lenders. Chief executive officer Ulrich Koerner and Chairman Axel Lehmann are already facing questions over whether the biggest overhaul in the bank’s recent history is radical enough and offers sufficient payoff for suffering shareholders.

“The new Credit Suisse will definitely be profitable from 2024 onwards,” Koerner said in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s Francine Lacqua. “We do not want to overpromise and underdeliver, we want to do it the other way around.”"
1e6a56d9-4778-4a45-8f2d-2a0d683cc8ef,"Money markets pared rate-increase wagers slightly, pricing 56 basis points of tightening in December versus 58 basis points earlier.

Officials also toughened the terms on more than €2 trillion ($3.1 trillion) of ultra-cheap pandemic-era loans to banks known as TLTROs. The agreements had become problematic after the recent rapid rate increases allowed lenders to park TLTRO cash in ECB accounts and earn a risk-free income.

Changing the conditions retroactively carries legal risks and could make banks wary of similar offers in the future, undermining their effectiveness. Deutsche Bank chief financial officer James von Moltke said on Wednesday he’d be “disappointed” if the terms were adjusted as banks signed up “faithfully” to keep credit flowing.

Officials also cut the interest they pay on the reserves banks are required to hold at the ECB to match the deposit rate.

Pushback from European governments

With president Christine Lagarde and her colleagues moving in increments that appeared almost inconceivable earlier this year, the focus is shifting to how high borrowing costs can be lifted as households grapple with surging heating and mortgage bills.

Some officials have publicly indicated that Thursday’s move might not be the last of that magnitude – a topic Lagarde will be quizzed on when she holds a news conference in the afternoon European time. Analysts polled by Bloomberg see the deposit rate peaking at 2.5 per cent in March, though they expect the pace of increases to ease after this month.

Determining the appropriate dose of monetary tightening will be tough. While natural gas prices, which shot up after Russia invaded Ukraine, have fallen more than two-thirds since the summer, officials fret that inflation is broadening across goods and services and could spur expectations for further gains.

What’s more, politicians are starting to push back against rapidly rising borrowing costs as their economies buckle under the weight of the energy crisis. Italy’s new prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, used her first speech to parliament to criticise rate increases, while French President Emmanuel Macron has also grumbled.

The ECB’s hikes will eventually be complemented by efforts to reverse bond buying that formed part of the stimulus response to recent crises. A debate has begun on shrinking its €5 trillion in debt holdings – a process known as quantitative tightening – though concrete action isn’t expected until next year.

2a8e92af-4226-4e56-853d-ee9b94137860,"MOSCOW, Russia: The Russian central bank has cut its key interest rate by 300 basis points for a third time since its emergency hike in late February, citing cooling inflation and a recovery in the ruble.

Russia's central bank kept its interest rate unchanged at 7.5%, citing inflationary expectations and geopolitical uncertainty following the ""partial mobilization"" of Russian troops into Ukraine and prospects for a prolonged conflict.

The move to hold the interest rate ended a cycle of several months of cutting that began in April. The central bank had more than doubled rates to 20% shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine to counter a plummeting ruble.

The central bank has cut rates six times since then, hitting the pre-war interest rate of 9.5% by June, citing improvements in fiscal conditions and lowering inflation. While inflation is still far above the bank's target of 4%, sitting at 13.7% in September, it's fallen significantly from the 20-year high of 20.37% it hit in April as Western sanctions and foreign exchange freezes set in.

The decision to hold rates at 7.5% was expected by a majority of analysts interviewed by Reuters, the news agency reported.

1e958876-3e62-43e8-ad21-dda977538fda,"













FRANKFURT, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Some European Central Bank policymakers played down a change in the ECB's official message on interest rates, which saw the bank remove a reference to ""several"" further hikes in the coming months, sources told Reuters.

The European Central Bank raised interest rates again on Thursday and said it expects to increase them ""further"" but it cautioned ""substantial"" progress had already been made in its bid to fight off a historic surge in inflation.

It also dropped a reference to increasing rates ""over the next several meetings"" that was in its September statement. Traders took it to mean that the series of large rate hikes that started in July was nearing an end.

Some policy hawks, who favour higher interest rates, said the change in guidance was not a major point of discussion at the meeting and barely noticed it in the ECB's official statement, four sources, who asked not to be named, said.

But doves, who defend lower rates, claimed that change as a victory, saying it paved the ground for ending the ECB's tightening cycle as soon as December or in March at the latest, the sources added.

Both camps also differed on their views about economic outlook, with doves emphasising the recent fall in commodity prices and especially natural gas as well as the clear signs of a recession in the euro zone.

Hawks, by contrast, said inflation showed no signs of abating and was likely to be fuelled by wage growth and the weak euro, meaning a slowdown in the pace of hikes was not warranted.

All sources were surprised by the large market reaction, which saw bonds and bank shares rally. This was also influenced by the ECB's decision to push back any decision on shrinking its pile of bonds and by better-than-expected new terms on the ECB's multi-year loans.

An ECB spokesman declined to comment. ECB President Christine Lagarde, speaking at a press conference on Thursday, said that it ""might"" take several meetings before rates peaked.

Noting the change in the wording, UniCredit economist Marco Valli said it could signal increased caution from the ECB.

""Despite the jumbo hike, communication turned more cautious,"" Valli said, noting several other small changes that highlight the darkened economic outlook.

LONDON (Reuters) -The euro dropped back below parity against the dollar as European government bond yields slid after the European Central Bank raised rates by an expected 75 basis points, but hinted at a slower pace of future increases.

The central bank's second successive 75 basis point increase comes as inflation is high and broadening, but spot energy prices are falling, a looming recession will dampen price pressures, and there are no significant signs of a wage-price spiral.

This could give the ECB the chance to slow its rate increases, or maybe even pause them early in 2023, though ECB chief Christine Lagarde would not be drawn.

She reiterated at the post-meeting press conference that the ECB had made significant progress in withdrawing monetary accommodation but had more ground to cover.

""We have acknowledged more rate (hikes) are in the pipeline but at which pace and to which level I cannot tell you,"" she said.

Bank stocks were also in focus, rising after the central bank changed the terms of one of its pandemic-era programme of loans to lenders.

""The ECB is living on the edge of a dovish pivot,"" said Viraj Patel, global macro strategist at Vanda Research.

""It's clear that this is a central bank that wants to front-load rate hikes to control inflation. But they are also wary that they are not in control of a lot of external growth and market factors that can act as a circuit-breaker to the hiking cycle.""

The euro fell over 1% against the dollar to $0.9972 compared to $1.0032 before the ECB decision. It also lost ground against sterling and the Japanese yen

Adding to pressure on the euro was a rally in the government debt market, which sent yields lower, after the ECB signaled that it had not discussed how or when it would unwind its huge holding of euro zone bonds.

The yield on both German and Italian government bonds dropped, reflecting the rise in their prices. The benchmark German 10-year Bund was down 12 basis points on the day at 2% compared with 2.195% before the ECB announcement.

The ECB's statement at its last meeting in September said ""over the next several meetings the Governing Council expects to raise interest rates further to dampen demand,"" while Thursday's merely said it expected ""to raise interest rates further"".

""This is probably an indication of a slower rate increase in December,"" said Chris Scicluna, head of Research, Daiwa Capital Markets.

Euro money markets showed traders expect euro zone rates to peak around 2.55% by next November from almost 3% before the ECB's policy decision.

European bank stocks were up 0.84% having earlier traded lower, following the changes to the terms of the ECB's Targeted Longer-term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO) to remove a subsidy on its multi-year loans to banks to encourage them to repay them early.

The changes were not as dramatic as some in the market had expected.

""Interestingly, bank stocks have risen, despite the tightening of rules on TLTROs. Our view is that this is because the lack of discussion of quantitative tightening (QT) is seen as dovish, given the context,"" said Altaf Kassam, head of investment strategy, State Street.

121295d6-5e94-47b7-96cf-eec8bd559182,"Sterling soared to its highest value against the Euro since September after the European Central Bank vowed to keep printing money until 2024.

While the pound has continued stabilising since former Prime Minister Liz Truss's disastrous mini-budget, the Euro continued to slump on Thursday as the ECB desperately works to raise borrowing costs to stave off a recession.

The pound stood at 1.1594 against the Euro at 4.30pm - having rallied more than 0.5 per cent since trading opened this morning as investors continue to shy away from the bloc's currency.

Thursday's mark saw sterling reach its highest level against the Euro since September 6.

It was a more mixed picture on the stock market for Britain's indexes, with the FTSE 100 climbing 0.27 per cent up to 7,074.44 at 4.30pm, while the FTSE 250 sank 0.18 per cent to 18,082.73.

Meanwhile, the yield on gilts – government bonds – has fallen back following the resignation of Liz Truss meaning borrowing costs for the Government have dropped.

In the two days after Prime Minister Rishi Sunak took power with a promise to fix the mistakes of his predecessor and stabilise the economy, sterling rose around 3 per cent against the dollar to climb to an almost six-week high overnight.

'While the market is relieved that Sunak and Hunt have taken the reins of the UK economy, the fundamental backdrop remains very sour and the headwinds facing the pound are still significant,' Rabobank currency strategist Jane Foley said.

Sterling soared to its highest value against the Euro in more than a month after the European Central Bank vowed to maintain its quantitative easing programme until 2024

The S&P Global Flash Eurozone composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good guide to overall economic health, fell to 47.1 this month, down from 48.1 in September, as soaring inflation and high energy prices hit Europe

Thursday saw the ECB's third consecutive interest rate hike - taking rates to their highest level since January 2009 as they vowed to continue printing money until 2024.

Quantitative Easing is a money printing method by central banks to accompany interest rate cuts to kick start economic activity and spur demand when an economy is in recession or at least struggling.

With the bloc facing inflation of more than 10 percent, the ECB again sent interest rates soaring as they aggressively try to rein in rising prices.

In his first speech as Prime Minister on Tuesday, Mr Sunak vowed to fix the 'mistakes' of Ms Truss's leadership as he braced the nation for 'difficult decisions' ahead.

Sterling gained more than a cent against the dollar within the space of an hour as several ministers who served under Ms Truss stepped down, including business secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg.

The pound also held gains in early Asian trading after soaring yesterday as global markets welcomed the start of Rishi Sunak's premiership.

Meanwhile, the interest rate on a 20-year government bond stood at 3.6 per cent after topping 5 per cent following ex-chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's unfunded tax cuts. This effectively means it is now cheaper for the Government to borrow money.

Sterling had slumped to its lowest value in decades following then-Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's explosive mini-budget that promised the biggest set of unfunded tax cuts in half a century.

The ECB today raised rates by an expected 75 basis points to 1.5pc overall - with further hikes over the coming year appearing all but certain as the Eurozone battles with the looming threat of recession.

Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global, said the UK data 'showed the pace of economic decline gathering momentum after the recent political and financial market upheavals'.

He said: 'The heightened political and economic uncertainty has caused business activity to fall at a rate not seen since the global financial crisis in 2009, if pandemic lockdown months are excluded.'

Economic output 'looks certain to fall in the fourth quarter after a likely third quarter contraction, meaning the UK is in recession,' he added.

The latest official data showed that economic output fell 0.3pc in the three months to August compared with the previous quarter. The services sector saw its first decline in activity since February 2021, when the UK was just readying to emerge from the final Covid lockdown.

John Glen, chief economist at the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply, said: 'Concerns over rising energy and food bills affected consumer appetite for pubs and restaurants, and demand was scaled back.'

Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt are said to be considering using falling gas prices and a 'dullness dividend' reaped from financial markets after the change in government to rein in their drastic plans.

But there was some sign that red-hot inflation was starting to ease, as the latest rise in operating expenses was the least marked for 13 months.

While the Bank of England may be relieved that cost pressures are beginning to lift, as it tries to wrestle down the rise in the cost of living, Williamson said it was unlikely officials would be able to take their foot off the interest rate hike pedal any time soon.

The Bank has been bumping up rates since December to encourage saving rather than spending and keep a lid on prices. Yet cost pressures were still stronger than at any time in the 20 years before the pandemic – and the service sector in particular was struggling with energy bill rises and leaps in staff wages.

Markets are pricing in a 0.75 percentage-point hike for the next monetary policy meeting on November 3, set to take rates to 3pc.

'On top of the collapse in political stability, financial market stress and slump in confidence, these higher borrowing costs will add to speculation of a worryingly deep UK recession,' Mr Williamson added.

The Chancellor yesterday announced that the medium term fiscal announcement would be delayed from Halloween to November 17 to allow time to rework the economic plan amid a £40 billion black hole in the nation's finances.

Analysis has today shown that the two-week postponement cut the figure by up to £15 billion with the interest rate on government gilts and international gas prices both falling swiftly.

The fortnight delay will also allow the Office of Budget Responsibility to base its forecasts for UK finances on more recent economic conditions.

Meanwhile, gas prices have halved, crashing from £190 per megawatt hour last month to around £90 in international markets.

A spokesman for the OBR said: 'Had our forecast been published on October 31, it would have been based on market determinants, including for gas prices and gilt yields, from the early to middle part of October.

'Postponing the date to November 17 means that we will take a later window for these market prices.'"

The ECB expects to raise interest rates further to hit the medium-term inflation target of 2%.

The largest cryptocurrencies Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) price soars almost 1% each after the ECB hiked interest rates.

Macro Improved Amid ECB Rate Hike and US GDP Report

The Governing Council of the ECB on October 27 raised the interest rate by another 75 bps. ECB believes the third continuous 75 bps rate hike will ensure a timely return of inflation to the medium-term inflation target of 2%. Moreover, the council adjusted the interest rates applicable to targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) from 23 November 2022. It will help offer voluntary early repayment dates for banks.

“The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will be increased to 2.00%, 2.25% and 1.50% respectively, with effect from 2 November 2022.”

The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) subdued after the ECB raised interest rates despite recession fears. Meanwhile, the U.S. Q3 GDP comes in higher at 2.6% against the expected 2.4%. It is the highest GDP growth since Q4 2021 and after recording negative GDP growth in the last two quarters. Thus, containing the U.S. from officially falling into recession. Elon Musk earlier said the U.S. economy is actually growing strongly, but Europe and China risk falling into recession.

Bitcoin and Ethereum Prices Soars Higher

The broader crypto market witnessed a further increase in prices as the macro improved. Bitcoin (BTC) price soared over 1% in an hour, with the current price trading at $20,708. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) price jumped almost 2% in an hour and 4% in the last 24 hours. The ETH price is trading at $1,573.

Altcoins including XRP, Cardano, Solana, and Polygon also witnessed a nearly 1% increase. Whereas, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu price rises further with a 4% and 2% increase in an hour, respectively.

64c8bca5-844e-44b8-98c5-cab102e00f54,"But sources said the local business would not carry an out-sized cost-cutting burden and many of the job losses would be achieved through natural attrition.

Credit Suisse’s local chief executive, Richard Gibb, said Australia remained a key market for Credit Suisse globally.

“With our new capital raise, we will be strongly capitalised, with a pro forma tier one capital ratio of about 14 per cent to enable us to grow our core businesses in Australia,” he said.

“We are also excited to re-establish the CS First Boston brand in Australia, where it has a rich heritage, and underscores the importance of advisory and capital markets to our franchise.”

Shares in the Swiss-headquartered financial services giant have plunged more than 51 per cent in the last year after the group was engulfed in a series of missteps, including last year’s collapse of Greensill Capital and multibillion-dollar losses stemming from the failure of hedge fund Archegos Capital.

Rumours about the stability of the bank began swirling earlier this month, causing the stock to fall sharply and the price of credit default swaps (CDS), which investors buy to protect themselves from a default in Credit Suisse bonds, surged to near-record levels.

Credit Suisse executives were forced to launch a rearguard action to assure investors, clients and counterparties that the $150 billion in loss absorbing capital on the bank’s balance sheet meant its stability was not in doubt.

The $US4 billion capital raising has long been mooted as a potential outcome of the review, but will still come as a bitter blow to long-term shareholders given the savage sell-off in the company’s stock over the last 12 months.

But the capital raising, plus the sale of a “significant portion” of the group’s existing securitised products division which will be sold to a consortium led by US private equity giant Apollo Global Management and US bond giant PIMCO, should put to rest any concerns about Credit Suisse’s financial position.

“This is a historic moment for Credit Suisse,” Mr Körner said. “We are radically restructuring the investment bank to help create a new bank that is simpler, more stable and with a more focused business model built around client needs.

“Our new integrated model, with our wealth management franchise, strong Swiss bank and capabilities in asset management at its core, is designed to allow us to deliver a unique and compelling proposition for clients and colleagues while targeting organic growth and capital generation for shareholders.”

The separation of CS First Boston from the “new” Credit Suisse is likely to occur gradually over the next 18 months.

Credit Suisse said CS First Boston would “be more global and broader than boutiques, but more focused than bulge bracket players”.

The current chief executive of the investment bank, Christian Meissner, will depart the group, while Michael Klein will step down from the group’s board to run CS First Boston.

Credit Suisse also posted its September quarter results on Thursday evening, showing the bank lost $US4 billion for the period, although this was dragged down by a $US3.7 billion impairment on deferred tax assets related to the restructure. On an adjusted pre-tax basis, the group posted a $US92 million loss for the September quarter and a $US234 million loss for the calendar year to date.

But the investment bank saw revenues dive 58 per cent in the September quarter as global deal activity stalled. Outflows of $US13 billion during the period hit Credit Suisse’s asset management business hard."
9da24b51-f9ad-4da1-b58a-485c9615ddc5,"Credit Suisse has disclosed sweeping plans to cut 9,000 jobs and raise billions of pounds from investors in a Saudi-led funding round, as part of a company-wide overhaul meant to draw a line under a series of scandals and help it recover from a £3.5bn loss.

The announcement follows months of speculation over the scale of change scheduled under its new boss, Ulrich Körner, who has been tasked with scaling back the investment bank and slashing costs.

Credit Suisse bosses hope investors will green-light plans to raise 4bn Swiss francs (£3.5bn), including 1.5bn Swiss francs from the Saudi National Bank (SNB), next month. The move would give the Saudi bank a 9.9% shareholding, making it the second-largest investor behind US investment group Harris Associates.

Credit Suisse’s share price fell 12% after the announcement.

Switzerland’s second-largest bank said it was shedding 2,700 full-time staff, accounting for about a third of its planned cuts and a fifth of its 52,000 global employees.

It expects the total staff base to shrink to 43,000 by the end of 2025, through a mix of further job cuts and natural attrition, meaning it will not replace staff when they leave the bank. The lender did not confirm how many of its 5,500 UK staff could be affected.

“This is a historic moment for Credit Suisse,” Körner said. “We are radically restructuring the investment bank to help create a new bank that is simpler, more stable and with a more focused business model built around client needs.”

The restructuring plans – which will put more focus on the bank’s asset management division for wealthy clients – are expected to cost about 2.9bn Swiss francs over the next three years. That will be funded by dumping some of its investments, selling portions of its business, and raising fresh money from investors.

The Saudi National Bank said it planned to take part in the fundraising to “support the establishment of an independent investment bank focused on advisory and capital markets activities”.

If approved, it will add another Middle Eastern investment vehicle to the bank’s list of top shareholders, which includes the Qatar Investment Authority and private investment firm Olayan Group, which has links to Saudi Arabia.

Credit Suisse also confirmed it would continue carving up its investment bank as it tried to raise more cash.

That will involve selling a part of its securitised products business – which buys and sells investment products that are backed by pools of assets like mortgages, credit card debt and car loans – to the American investment groups Pimco and Apollo.

It will also spin-off part of its investment bank, which will run under the branding CS First Boston. Credit Suisse said the business would be “more global and broader” than most boutique firms but would have a “more focused” approach than big investment banking rivals, which include UBS and Goldman Sachs.

The Credit Suisse chair, Axel Lehmann, said while the investment bank had built a “powerful and respected” business over its 166-year history, it had become “unfocused” in recent years.

“For a number of months, the board of directors along with the executive board has been assessing our future direction and, in doing so, we believe we have left no stone unturned,” he added.

The overhaul follows a series of scandals in recent years. Credit Suisse was embroiled in the collapse of the lender Greensill Capital and the US hedge fund Archegos Capital in 2021. That year, it also admitted defrauding investors as part of the Mozambique “tuna bonds” loan scandal, resulting in a fine worth more than £350m.

This year, Swiss prosecutors found the bank guilty of helping to launder money on behalf of the Bulgarian mafia. The bank has denied wrongdoing and said it would appeal against the ruling.

Credit Suisse also came under fire after the Suisse secrets investigation, which showed it had served clients involved in torture, drug trafficking, money laundering, corruption and other serious crimes over decades.

“The new executive board is focused on restoring trust through the relentless and accountable delivery of our new strategy, where risk management remains at the very core of everything we do,” Körner said."

c386cf09-fb1f-452b-966b-f1fcf76b91fc,"ANZ has beaten earnings expectations across the board, but the results don't appear to have been strong enough to impress the market.

The bank on Thursday announced its cash profit for the 12 months to September 30 had increased five per cent to $6.5 billion, beating consensus expectations by 6.4 per cent.

ANZ chief executive Shayne Elliott said it was an outstanding financial result with contributions from all four divisions of the company: retail, commercial, institutional and New Zealand.

""Contributions from right across the board, good underlying growth and the right sort of metrics,"" he said. ""And strong productivity performances as well.""

The bank managed to right-size its formerly struggling Australian home loans business, with application times back in line with industry peers and a fully automated digital home loan product rolling out next year.

Its commercial profit was up 11 per cent, institutional revenue was up two per cent year on year and ANZ's profit from New Zealand was up seven per cent for the year.

The company announced a final dividend of 74c per share, beating expectations of a 73c dividend. Its total payout for the year will be $1.46 per share, up 3 per cent from last year.

David Berthon-Jones, co-chief investment officer with Aequitas Investment Partners, tweeted that it was a ""strong result to open the big bank reporting season"".

But at 1.08pm AEDT, ANZ shares were down 3.3 per cent to $24.985. They had changed hands for as little as $24.16, down 6.5 per cent from Wednesday's close.

Westpac and NAB were also down but not nearly as much, falling by 0.5 per cent and 0.3 per cent, respectively. CBA had risen 0.7 per cent.

Mr Elliott warned of looming uncertainty as central banks struggled to control inflation and events like the war in Ukraine weighed on markets.

However, he said both the bank and the economy were well positioned to weather what might come.

""If we look at the data today, Australian households and New Zealand households have never been wealthier, they've never been more employed,"" he said.

Australian net household debt was the lowest it had been in 15 years and the number of customers behind on debt repayments continued to fall, although Mr Elliott said that was likely to change soon.

For those customers who might be at risk of mortgage stress, such as those who borrowed more than 80 per cent and bought at the height of the market, ANZ has invested heavily in systems that can identify them.

""For example, we can quickly identify home loans located in a postcode experiencing falling house values for those who are already in or approaching negative equity and actively monitor them and help as needed,"" the ANZ chief said.

Mr Elliott said the bank's new digital offering, ANZ Plus, was seeing early success with deposits reaching $1.2 billion.

He said it was growing at a faster pace than any other new digital bank in Australia and ANZ was focused on migrating existing customers to the platform.

ANZ agreed in July to buy Suncorp's banking business for $4.9 billion in the industry's biggest deal in a decade, although the agreement is yet to receive regulatory approval.

Mr Elliott said Suncorp was a well-run business that would provide important growth for ANZ through its exposure to the fast-growing Queensland economy.

ANZ also announced on Thursday it would ask shareholders in December to approve an internal restructuring, separating its banking and non-banking functions into two groups. ANZ Group Holdings would be established as the new parent company.

ANZ'S 'OUTSTANDING' YEAR

* Statutory profit after tax up 16pct to $7.2 billion for the 12 months to September 30, compared to the 12 months previous.

* Cash profit from continuing operations up 5pct to $6.5 billion

Sure ANZ chief executive, Shayne Elliott, is fully cognisant of the economic and geopolitical headwinds gathering over the horizon, but he believes that to the extent there is a cliff, Australia is not about to fall off it.

Elliot and his board are equally aware of the strain of cost of living increases, rising inflation and its drag on consumer confidence, but from where they are sitting, none of it is affecting the ability of ANZ’s customers to pay interest.

SYDNEY--Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. said full-year net profit increased 16%, boosted by its retail and institutional banking divisions, but the company warned that cost-of-living pressures may mean a ""testing"" six months ahead.

The Australian major lender on Thursday reported a statutory profit of 7.12 billion Australian dollars (US$4.63 billion) for the 12 months ended Sept. 30.

Analysts had expected a full-year net profit of A$6.71 billion, according to FactSet's consensus estimate.

ANZ's retail division saw second-half profit up 6% half-on-half, while revenue in institutional rose 2% on-year.

Cash earnings--a measure tracked by analysts that strips out non-core items--rose by 5.0% to A$6.50 billion.

ANZ Chief Executive Shayne Elliott said all divisions made a material contribution to the full-year result, which demonstrated the benefits of its diversified business.

""We restored momentum in Australian home loans with application approval times back in line with industry peers,"" he said.

""We continued the re-platforming of Australia Retail onto ANZ Plus, which is our new digital bank, with deposits already exceeding A$1.2 billion and growing at a rate faster than any new digital bank in Australia.""

Still, ANZ's net interest margin--a key profitability indicator--was 1.63%, compared with 1.64% a year ago.

Australian bank NIMs had been under pressure amid the low interest rate environment, with the Reserve Bank of Australia making successive interest rate hikes, analysts have tipped that lenders should see margin benefits over time.

Mr. Elliott said that the world was in a period of ""significant uncertainty,"" against a backdrop of rising inflation and geopolitical uncertainty.

""Fortunately, RBA data show aggregate household balance sheets, net of liquid assets, are the best they have been for 15 years,"" he said.

""While this data suggests on average people are still doing well, cost-of-living pressures are starting to have a meaningful impact and the next six months will be testing.""

The bank declared a final dividend of A$0.74 per share, compared with A$0.72 a year earlier, with cash return on equity at 10.4%.

ANZ's Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio--a key measure of a bank's ability to withstand financial shocks--was flat for the year at 12.3%. This is above the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority's 'Unquestionably Strong' benchmark.

The company said it was well placed to meet the requirements from the APRA Capital Reforms from January.

(Reuters) -Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd on Thursday reported a rise in annual cash profit, surpassing market expectations, as its home loans business improved and higher interest rates boosted margins in the second half.

ANZ said its home loan application times were back in line with industry peers, following an overhaul to address processing delays that had kept the lender from cashing in on a COVID-driven housing boom.

Shares, however, dropped as much as 4.6% to A$24.67 in their worst intraday loss since June, against a broader financial index that was down 1.4%, as the lender also flagged headwinds arising from wage and vendor cost inflation.

""Despite higher costs we see upside to consensus FY23 core earnings as the NIM leverage has become more obvious,"" analysts at Citi said in a note.

The lender also aims to introduce a fully automated digital home loan to further bolster its mortgage loans business, and is planning a pilot programme of a digital home loan in the coming weeks.

ANZ's group net interest margin, a key measure of profitability, grew 10 basis points from the first half to 1.68% in the second half of the year.

Runaway inflation has pushed the Australian central bank to pursue its most aggressive tightening cycle in decades, boosting margins for banks that had grappled with record-low interest rates for the past two years.

The bank said it expects the environment to be supportive for margins in the first half, although any change from the exit margin is likely to be more modest.

Annual cash profit from continuing operations was A$6.52 billion ($4.23 billion), beating a Visible Alpha consensus estimate of A$6.31 billion.

The bank proposed a final dividend of 74 Australian cents per share, compared with 72 cents last year.

TOKYO, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Japanese life insurers plan to buy more super-long government bonds, enticed by the highest yields since 2014.

Nippon Life, Japan Post Insurance and Sumitomo Life are among the insurers that have detailed their investment plans for the rest of the fiscal year-ending April at briefings over the past several days.

A common theme has been an intention to increase holdings of the longest-maturity JGBs, centered on the 30-year securities, which now offer ""attractive"" yields as well as being a safe haven from a long list of market uncertainties globally.

Many insurers also plan to shift some money from currency-hedged holdings of foreign bonds into yen bonds, with hedging costs soaring.

""There is now an attractiveness to Japanese government bonds,"" while ""the attractiveness of hedged foreign bonds is waning,"" a Japan Post Insurance representative told a briefing on Friday. ""We have already been shifting from hedged foreign bonds into JGBs, and we will continue to do so.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese life insurers plan to buy more super-long government bonds, enticed by the highest yields since 2014.

Nippon Life, Japan Post Insurance and Sumitomo Life are among the insurers that have detailed their investment plans for the rest of the fiscal year-ending April at briefings over the past several days.

A common theme has been an intention to increase holdings of the longest-maturity JGBs, centered on the 30-year securities, which now offer ""attractive"" yields as well as being a safe haven from a long list of market uncertainties globally.

Many insurers also plan to shift some money from currency-hedged holdings of foreign bonds into yen bonds, with hedging costs soaring.

""There is now an attractiveness to Japanese government bonds,"" while ""the attractiveness of hedged foreign bonds is waning,"" a Japan Post Insurance representative told a briefing on Friday. ""We have already been shifting from hedged foreign bonds into JGBs, and we will continue to do so.""

Yields on 30-year JGBs soared as high as 1.685% on Thursday for the first time since September 2014, while the 20-year yield reached the highest since February 2015 at 1.315%. Both fell back as investors scooped up the discounted debt.

cba7b6a8-8e7f-4882-b74d-a3d83ec9034e,"Household are facing a tough six months as the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation goes from bad to worse, with soaring grocery and energy bills hitting households hard.

That was the picture drawn by official inflation figures on Wednesday, which revealed consumer prices rose 7.2 per cent annually in the September quarter, the fastest pace in more than three decades.

But what surprised economists was not headline inflation – ahead of an expected peak of 7.75 per cent by Christmas – but the massive run-up of essential costs like food and energy.

Grocery prices have skyrocketed over the past three months as the effects of widespread flooding in key growing regions earlier this year begins to flow through to supermarkets.

It saw prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages soar an astonishing 9 per cent – driven by a much larger 16 per cent spike in fruit and vegetable prices in annual terms.

And with the damage from ongoing floods in Victoria and New South Wales still being assessed, these figures are likely to get even worse heading into Christmas, as families prepare reunions.

“It’s not a pretty picture,” BIS Oxford senior economist Sean Langcake said. “This is a huge squeeze.”

Coles is already sounding the alarm, telling investors on Wednesday – mere hours before the latest inflation data dropped – that its food prices had risen 7.1 per cent in the quarter.

“Fresh inflation was 8.8 per cent and continued to be driven by bakery, reflecting higher wheat prices, and fresh produce, particularly in fruit such as berries and bananas,” Coles said.

“Raw material, commodity, shipping and fuel costs remained the key drivers of supplier input cost requests received in the first quarter impacting inflation in packaged [goods].”



Making matters worse, Making matters worse, energy bills are also soaring as earlier spikes in wholesale power and gas prices begin to flow through to households after annual adjustments from retailers.

Gas and household fuel bills shot up 10.9 per cent in the quarter, while electricity prices rose 3.2 per cent. It would have been 15.6 per cent if it weren’t for government subsidies.

These programs are time-limited though, so before long Australians will feel the full brunt.

Floods drive inflation uncertainty

It all underscores a massive challenge for the Reserve Bank, which is banking on inflation easing early next year after a series of steep rate hikes dampen demand among shoppers.

But if the impact of widespread flooding around the La Nina weather pattern persists into 2023, as the latest official forecasts indicate, then food prices could keep rising even higher.

And that could, in turn, deliver a higher inflation result and bigger rises in interest rates, further squeezing households through higher mortgage bills.

The cash rate target has already risen from 0.1 per cent to 2.6 per cent in the past six months, and spurred by the latest inflation figures ANZ economists upgraded their forecasts on Wednesday to predict rates will now peak at 3.85 per cent by May next year.

Such an increase would represent more than $1000 extra on a typical $500,000 25-year monthly mortgage repayment within a year.

The good news is that economists are still optimistic that headline inflation will ease, namely because petrol prices are now falling from earlier highs and construction costs aren’t increasing as fast as they were.

The issue here, though, is that what matters to households isn’t where the inflation rate lands, but how the soaring cost of essentials is eating into their budgets ahead of Christmas.

And because these price increases are being caused by supply disruptions – both global and local – higher interest rates are unlikely to abate this increasingly acute cost of living crisis."
6d6d0f64-ffc7-49eb-87a5-fb5bb99bd882,"Cost of living: The lowest-priced items have increased in cost by around 17% over the 12 months to September.

The price of food staples such as pasta, tea, chips and cooking oil has soared over the past year, hitting family budgets as the cost of living crisis continues to bite.

According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Tuesday, the lowest-priced items have increased in cost by around 17% over the 12 months to September. This is an increase from 7% over the 12 months to April.

The price of the cheapest vegetable oil on the shelves climbed 65% higher last month compared with a year ago, while pasta rose 60%.

Tea also climbed 46% last month, while chips rose 39% and bread and biscuits by 38% and 34%, respectively.

“While the recent spike in inflation began with energy prices, today’s fresh insights using a new innovative data source show they are now filtering through to other important items, with the cheapest price of some staple food items rising by around two thirds in the last year,” Sir Ian Diamond, chief executive of the UK Statistics Authority, said.

It comes as UK inflation currently stands at a 40-year high, with prices up 10.1% in a year. Meanwhile the war in Ukraine has exacerbated the prices of global wheat prices, which affects the price of pasta and bread.

Meanwhile, orange juice, minced beef, granulated sugar, and rice were among the few items that had fallen in price over the past 12 months. Orange juice dropped 9%, and minced beef was down 7%.

Average increase in cost of lowest-priced items. Chart: ONS

The ONS started taking a closer look at the figures after food poverty campaigner and activist Jack Monroe warned that poorer families were being hit by faster increases in prices of value items.

She argued in January that the standard measure of inflation that “includes a leg of lamb, bedroom furniture, a television and champagne seems a blunt and darkly comical tool” for poorer households struggling to make ends meet.

But the ONS said on Tuesday: “Crucially, these large rises in the cheapest available items are broadly in line with the average food price rises reported within the ONS's regular headline inflation measures.”

It also noted that the data is “highly experimental” – they obtained it by scraping supermarket websites and the methodology is still being updated.

The ONS also published separate data showing that 72% of people with prepayment energy meters are finding it difficult to pay their bills.

A survey also found that seven in 10 (69%) of black adults are finding it difficult to afford their energy bills, compared to just 44% of white adults. The survey showed that 59% of Asian adults were struggling with energy bills.

Myron Jobson, senior personal finance analyst at Interactive Investor, said: “Those on the breadline struggle most with rising food prices as they spend a greater proportions of their incomes on food and drink than those further up the income spectrum.

""With many of us opting against receiving receipts at self-checkouts, it is difficult to keep track of price rises – supermarkets aren’t likely to shout about upping prices. It is also hard to notice price increases and budget for them when they go up in small increments over a stretch of time rather than a sudden jump.""

He added: “It is interesting that more of us are turning to own label products to reduce the grocery bill, but the cost benefits of switching to lower priced store brand equivalents wane when prices are rising across the board.

“The headline grocery price inflation figure can dramatically differ from your own personal inflation number. As such, and it is worth keeping tabs on your spending habits to get a better idea of the goods and services that are eating most into your budget, and where you could cut back.”

A PROPER pound-stretcher, swapping to this 28p pack would amount to a real saving.

This spag has the addition of wheat flour to durum wheat and semolina, which slightly increases the starch in the cooking water but makes no difference to the taste.

The fibres are fine so you feel as though there is plenty to portion up on the plate.

Although they were a little sticky once out of the pan, this didn’t affect the flavour.

Watch the cooking time as I found 10-12 minutes was too long.

I WAS pleasantly surprised that the M&S spaghetti came in costing less than some leading supermarkets, as this is a quality packet of strands hailing from authentic pasta makers in the Italian Alps.

The dried product was a more intense yellow colour than some others, but once cooked lost the vibrant hue.

The strands stayed firm without going soggy and kept a nice bite for cooking ‘al dente’ style.

Tasty with an oily sauce that’ll cling to the strands, like a simple pesto.

ANOTHER super-saver spaghetti that does the job perfectly well for a store-cupboard staple, while keeping more of your pennies in your purse.

The strands were a touch soft and rather fine, but there were no complaints from me about using it for everyday cooking.

It would be lovely with a carbonara sauce to mop up all the juices.

Do watch the cooking time though, as the 10-12 minutes recommended on the packet seems a bit too long for the pasta to be in the boiling water.

A PERFECTLY adequate bowl of spaghetti that I would be more than happy to eat again.

But this is not a pasta to get especially passionate or excited about.

These strands do the belly-filler job, but were rather thin and feeble, and a bit tasteless.

Once you coat them in sauce though, there’s nothing to complain about when whipping up a basic bowl of spag bol.

However, considering the price is higher than others, I’d hoped for better.

THERE are good ingredients in this Aldi own-brand staple – simply durum wheat, semolina and water.

The threads are extremely fine so you get plenty of servings out of a packet, although it does make the spaghetti a bit flimsier on the fork.

Not the best for twirling, and I would avoid creamier or very robust sauces with these delicate strands.

But I’d have no problem with keeping a packet of this in the cupboard as an everyday basic.

It’s a shame the price isn’t as budget as some others.

At 23p a packet, this is a whopping quarter of the price of some other supermarket spags.

Unbeatable value for money and makes a quality bowl of pasta, too.

Once smothered in a tasty, punchy sauce, there’s barely any difference between this and the more expensive offerings so it’s well worth trying a swap.

It only loses a point because the cooking instructions leave the thinner fibres slightly soggy.

Reducing the pan time would probably help.

This is a top-notch spaghetti that might not be the most rock-bottom price, but is still cheaper than plenty of others – and the taste and quality were outstanding.

Perfect golden threads that cooked to the ideal ‘al dente’ – firm and slightly chewy – with a delicious, nutty authentic taste.

I’d happily eat a bowl of this spaghetti with nothing more than a little olive oil and a twist of black pepper topped with some cheese.

As householders are seeing the price of everything go up, the rise in the cost of everyday food items has been laid bare.

New data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows the cost of vegetable oil rose to 65% while pasta rose 60% in a year. Other huge increases include the price of tea, which had risen by 46% while chips were up 39%, bread rose by 38% and biscuits were up 34%, the Mirror reports.

However, despite huge increases on some essential items, others saw a fall in price including orange juice which fell by 9%, minced beef which was down 7%, sugar by 0.3% and rice by 0.2%. The ONS looked at 1.5million online prices over the 12 months to September 2022, with the figures representing the difference in lowest prices.

It comes after Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation - the main measure of how much goods and services have risen in price - is at a 40-year high of 10.1%. Food and energy were the largest contributors for the jump in inflation in the 12 months to September. Food and non-alcoholic beverage prices rose by 14.5%.

The rise in the cost of groceries has been accelerated by the war in Ukraine, which is continuing to push up the price of animal feed, fertiliser and vegetable oil. The ONS cautioned that one limitation of its latest data release is product availability.

For example, some items were not always available in-store or online which meant the next lowest-price option was used as a substitution.

National statistician Sir Ian Diamond said: ""While the recent spike in inflation began with energy prices, today's fresh insights using a new innovative data source show they are now filtering through to other important items, with the cheapest price of some staple food items rising by around two-thirds in the last year.

""Figures from our near real time survey of people show that while rises in food and energy costs are affecting many people across the country, those who are disabled, from certain ethnic minority backgrounds and renters are among those struggling the most.

""With rises in the cost of living at the forefront of many people’s minds, our new, almost real time, data showing just how prices are changing and shining a light on how different groups are affected have never been more important.""

Price hikes are expected to happen during 2023, Ek told The Wall Street Journal.

Apple Music and YouTube have hiked their prices over the past week.

Spotify CEO Daniel Ek said on Tuesday he would like to increase the price of subscriptions for users in the US.

Ek's comments came after Spotify posted its third-quarter earnings, reporting increases in active users and paid subscribers, as well as a better-than-expected climb in revenue.

""Mostly to the US-based price increases, it is one of the things that we would like to do, and this is a conversation we will have in light of these recent developments with our label partners,"" Ek said during the earnings call on Tuesday.

Since Spotify was launched in 2011, it has charged $9.99 for its individual premium subscription and $15.99 for a family plan.

Ek said that when Spotify's competitors increase their prices, it's good for the company. He added that Spotify has raised prices in more than 46 markets around the world.

Ek said he felt ""really good"" about this upcoming year and ""what that means in pricing in relation to our service.""

In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Ek said subscription price hikes should be expected in 2023.

Ek didn't disclose in Tuesday's earnings call or the interview with the Journal how much prices were set to jump.

The comments on future price hikes come a day after Apple raised the cost of its music and video streaming services for individuals from $9.99 per month to $10.99, and the family plan from $14.99 to $16.99 per month, CNN reported. YouTube also recently raised its premium family subscription from $17.99 per month to $22.99, per TechCrunch.

Spotify didn't immediately respond to Insider's request for comment on the potential price increases.

Ek also took to Twitter on Tuesday, accusing Apple of putting competitors at a disadvantage. Elon Musk replied to his tweet and suggested Apple's approach was ""concerning."" It comes amid Spotify and Apple's long-running dispute over the iPhone maker's App Store rules."
bf4bee61-c689-40d1-ae2c-238ebf1d686a,"Today marks another blow to subscribers and their wallets. Apple increased the subscription prices for Apple TV+, Apple Music and the Apple One bundle in the U.S. — joining various other companies that have raised the prices of their subscription plans this year.

Apple TV+ will increase by $2 monthly and $10 annually. Subscribers will be charged $6.99 per month or $69 per year.

This will be the first time Apple TV+ has raised its subscription price since its launch, signifying a frustrating time for streaming subscribers who have seen price hikes left and right lately. Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ and YouTube Premium’s family plan all experienced price increases this year.

Apple Music is seeing a price hike of $1 for individual subscribers and $2 for families. The individual plan will now be $10.99 per month and the family plan will be $16.99 per month.

In June, it was reported that Apple Music quietly increased the price of its student plan in the U.S., Canada and the U.K.

Apple One is a subscription plan that bundles up to six Apple services like Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, iCloud+, Apple News+ and Apple Fitness+. The new prices for the individual plan, family plan and Premier plan are $16.95/month, $22.95/month and $32.95/month, respectively.

An Apple spokesperson provided a statement to TechCrunch:

The subscription prices for Apple Music, Apple TV+, and Apple One will increase beginning today. The change to Apple Music is due to an increase in licensing costs, and in turn, artists and songwriters will earn more for the streaming of their music. We also continue to add innovative features that make Apple Music the world’s best listening experience. We introduced Apple TV+ at a very low price because we started with just a few shows and movies. Three years later, Apple TV+ is home to an extensive selection of award-winning and broadly acclaimed series, feature films, documentaries, and kids and family entertainment from the world’s most creative storytellers.

Apple recently raised the prices for in-app purchases on the App Store in many countries across Asia and Europe."
839411b5-b1d2-436c-b271-f118822a5ac7,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. increased prices for its music and TV+ services for the first time, citing rising licensing costs, a move that risks giving rivals an edge in a fiercely competitive streaming industry.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The company increased the price of Apple Music to $10.99 a month from $9.99 for individuals, effective immediately, making it more expensive than services from Spotify Technology SA and Amazon.com Inc. Spotify surged as much as 9.4% to $97.07 in response to the news, its biggest intraday rally in almost three months.

With its video plan, TV+, Apple will continue to offer a lower price than companies like Netflix Inc. or Warner Bros. Discovery Inc., but that service has been slow to build as big a following as rival platforms. The price of Apple TV+ will climb to $6.99 from $4.99, and the standard Apple One bundle increases $2 to $16.95.

Apple’s push into streaming in recent years is part of a broader effort to generate more revenue from services. That category now generates nearly a quarter of the company’s sales -- almost $20 billion in the June quarter -- up from less than 10% in 2015. Apple is set to give its latest quarterly results this week.

The company said in a statement that the music price hike was due to “an increase in licensing costs” and that artists and songwriters will now earn more money. That came as good news for investors in Warner Music Group Corp., a top recording company, which sent the shares up as much as 15% on Monday.

Apple is also hiking its annual music plan to $109 from $99 and its TV+ yearly subscription to $69 from $49. Apple One bundles for families are going to $22.95 from $19.95, while the Premier package, which adds News+, Fitness+ and additional storage on top of Arcade, Music and TV+, is climbing $3 to $32.95.

Apple shares rose less than 1% to $148.56 on Monday. Though the stock is down 16% this year, that’s less of a rout than the broader indexes have suffered. The S&P 500 Index has fallen more than 20%.

In explaining the TV+ increase, Apple said that service was introduced “at a very low price” because it started with just a few shows and movies. It’s now “home to an extensive selection of award-winning and broadly acclaimed series, feature films, documentaries, and kids and family entertainment from the world’s most creative storytellers,” Apple said.

Still, the service’s viewership hasn’t matched that of other big streaming platforms. While Apple TV+ has had a run of critically acclaimed hits, including Oscar winner Coda and series such as Severance and Ted Lasso, it remains an also-ran in the hotly competitive streaming video space. Nielsen’s most recent report showed Americans spent more time watching at least five other paid services, plus ad-supported video from YouTube and Pluto TV.

Apple has increasingly relied on services to augment hardware sales in an environment where device upgrades have become pricier and less frequent. The Cupertino, California-based company has sped up the release of new digital offerings in recent years, including a credit card and, more recently, savings accounts.

Apple on Monday also released the first version of iPadOS 16 with Stage Manager multitasking software, as well as the macOS Ventura update for Mac desktops and laptops. It also rolled out iOS 16.1 with shared iCloud photo libraries and new features for smart homes.

The company isn’t alone in boosting streaming prices. The cost of Walt Disney Co.’s flagship Disney+ service will rise 38% to $11 later this year. The company is introducing a new ad-supported tier then that will be priced the same as its earlier offering at $8 a month. That follows a 43% price increase, to $10 a month, for its ESPN+ streaming service in August. Netflix, which raised prices earlier in the year, is also introducing an ad-supported plan, although -- at $7-a-month -- it will be cheaper than its existing offerings.

114ede51-1e02-498c-94af-25771f908766,"Apple is matching its wave of software updates with a not-so-pleasant price hike. As 9to5Mac reports, the company has raised the prices of Apple Music and Apple TV+. Music now costs $11 per month for individual plans (up from $10) in the US, or $109 per year. The Family plan now costs $17 per month instead of $15. TV+ sees the largest relative jump — the price has increased from $5 per month to $7, and from $50 per year to $69.

Accordingly, Apple has hiked prices for its multi-service One bundles. You now pay $17 per month for an Individual plan versus the earlier $15. Family users now pay $23 per month instead of $20, and Premier customers pay $33 per month where they previously paid $30.

A company spokesperson attributes the increases to licensing costs in a statement to 9to5. The more expensive plans will let artists and writers ""earn more"" from streaming music, Apple claims. The TV+ increase also reflects the size of the service, the representative adds. The video offering had ""just a few shows and movies"" when it launched three years ago, and now has a much larger catalog.

This won't thrill you if you're cross-shopping services. Spotify still asks $10 per month for its regular plan, and $16 for a six-user family account. You won't get lossless or spatial audio, but it's a better bargain if you're more interested in the lowest possible price. Things are murkier with video services. The higher pricing still makes Apple TV+ more affordable than Amazon Prime Video and ad-free Netflix (particularly if you want 4K HDR), and more specialized services like Disney+ and Hulu will charge extra in December. It's just a question of whether or not shows like Ted Lasso and Slow Horses are worth the outlay.

The larger One prices may be easier to swallow. It's difficult to find all-in-one bundles that combine music, video, cloud storage and other services, particularly if you want something Apple-friendly. And like it or not, you probably won't find alternatives that include fitness apps or magazine subscriptions."

In the near term, Mr Schellbach says Australia’s mineral-rich economy and equity market stand out amid inflationary pressures as investors seek overweight exposure to the “causes of inflation as opposed to the victims”. Meanwhile, the resilient Australian consumer continues to spend thanks to huge savings built up during the COVID-19 era.

Longer-term, he says the Australian equity market is exposed to four foundations that can propel it to a decade of outperformance: fast and strong population growth, dividend yields almost double the global average, concentrated industries supporting high-profit margins and companies relatively detached from the global economic cycle.

On income, Mr Schellbach notes that Australian companies pay outsized dividends compared with global peers, with yields typically double that of global equities, giving the income they offer great appeal in a lower equity return world.

Australia’s concentrated industry structure is also likely to appeal to foreign investors – a product of a vast country with a dispersed population, which makes it a hostile environment for new entrants. This translates into less competition, higher prices and higher profit margins.

“For consumers, the outcome of this is bad, ie less choice and expensive prices. But for the businesses already here, this is great, ie less competition and higher margins,” he said.

This year, the Vanguard Australian Shares ETF has outperformed the Vanguard MSCI Index International Shares ETF, with a negative 5.7 per cent return versus negative 11.4 per cent to September 30.

Over a 10-year period, the global fund’s benchmark is ahead, at 8.6 per cent for the local basket and 13.6 per cent for the MSCI World ex-Australia (net dividends reinvested).

Stagnant interest

Foreign ownership of Australian equities witnessed a steep decline in the mid-1990s thanks to the cumulative impact of compulsory superannuation, with Australian workers’ wages pouring into local stocks.

Ownership has recovered somewhat off early-2000 lows of 35 per cent, but remained static for the past two decades, and is currently at 40 per cent.

Mr Schellbach puts that down to foreign investors worrying that overvalued property and the heavily indebted consumer would lead to Australia experiencing a “day of reckoning” akin to the US economy through the 2008 sub-prime crisis.

However, he says housing market fears have largely dissipated alongside rising property prices globally while the Australian consumer has “continued to astound the sceptics”.

“A decade ago, Australia was an outlier in having overvalued property, this is no longer the case with the rest of the world having caught up,” he said.

With a 10-year outlook, UBS has highlighted 10 quality and non-cyclical ASX-listed growth companies to “comfortably own” for the next decade.

Apart from WiseTech, REA Group and Suncorp, included on the list are index heavyweights BHP and Commonwealth Bank of Australia, retail conglomerate Wesfarmers and toll road operator Transurban.

UBS analysts favour international student services and language testing business IDP Education, Tabcorp spin-off Lottery Corp and global engineering group Worley among the small to mid-market caps."
b06cac35-823e-40b1-8131-25ff8d721cda,"Focus on sovereign capabilities

Minister for Science and Innovation Ed Husic has rolled out a series of programs aimed at boosting Australia’s technology education pipeline including “start-up year”, a consultation process with universities where students can tack on an extra year of HELP-funded study to commercialise a start-up idea.

But the recent Optus hack, and the countrywide refocusing on the sovereign capabilities of Australia, has highlighted a difficult reality: the need for onshore investment in advanced manufacturing and local innovation combined with the desperate shortage of talent to meet this demand.

“The incentive to offshore is stronger than ever, precisely at the time when geopolitics makes it imperative to grow our sovereign capabilities,” Dario Valenza, chief technology officer of Carbonix, a carbon-fibre drone company that manufactures in Australia, said.

“Federal budgets should and must be sharply focused on providing real incentives to innovate, manufacture and hire in Australia.

“They should reflect well-thought-out policies of nurturing hubs where supply chains can develop as an ecosystem. They should reduce admin and compliance burdens by simplifying access to grants and entitlements that offset costs imposed by regulation, where that regulation itself can’t be further simplified.”

Cybersecurity top of mind

Following the Optus hack last month, there has been a countrywide refocus on cybersecurity, which experts have long argued requires increased attention from the government.

Over the past 12 months, the Australian Cyber Security Centre received more than 67,500 cybercrime reports which, the centre pointed out, equates to one incident every eight minutes.

Nicole Quinn, head of government affairs – APAC at security firm Fortinet, says the government can reinforce that cybersecurity is a core business function through tax incentives, training programs and legislation.

“Government investment in big-ticket items like infrastructure projects need to include cybersecurity as part of the project design and implementation,” Ms Quinn said.

“Cyber resiliency can be significantly improved through dedicated government investment in education, training, and upskilling of Australian businesses.”

Two programs were recently closed: the Cybersecurity Skills Partnership Innovation Fund, designed to boost skilled cybersecurity professionals, and the Cybersecurity Business Connect and Protect Program, aimed at advising small and medium businesses on cyber risks.

Privacy compliance under-funded

Johanna Weaver, the director of ANU’s Tech Policy Design Centre, says the budget should equip the existing regulators with the resources and capacity to respond adequately to privacy threats.

“Our privacy commissioner is the least resourced regulator in Australia’s tech ecosystem,” Ms Weaver said.

Privacy Commissioner Angelene Falk has warned that her office is unable to keep up with the increased scale and complexity of cases with its current funding.

“Their funding level is less than their funding in 2014-15, but their workload has increased exponentially,” Ms Weaver said.

“If the Albanese government is serious about responding to these breaches [at Optus and Medibank], the first step, the most simple step, in the budget is to increase the funding for the privacy commissioner.

“And then if new power is given through the Privacy Act reforms etc, there also needs to be new resources.”

Decarbonisation plans

The government-funded CSIRO has launched a $90 million fund to help commercialise technology breakthroughs in decarbonising Australia’s heavy industries such as agriculture and steel production.

But while Australia’s legislated climate change goals – to reduce emissions by 43 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 and achieve net zero emissions by 2050 – have been met with much relief by Australia’s innovation sector, many hope the budget will reveal more of the overarching incentives to decarbonise.

Doug McNamee, chief executive of Jolt, an electric vehicle infrastructure start-up, says an emissions standard is critical to incentivise the transport market towards electrification.

“Without a target to outlaw the sale of petrol cars by a certain date, global carmakers will just keep sending their petrol stock here because they can get full price for them,” Mr McNamee said.

He says the top-level climate goals are welcome, but little has been rolled out in the way of how cities and towns will adjust their planning to accommodate charging infrastructure. He hopes the federal budget will include funding for work that will plot a plan for the impending EV boom.

“We’re putting in as many EV chargers as we can at the moment, but without a co-ordinated strategy coming from the top down, we’re just going to have this lopsided market growth that won’t reach the targets at all,” he said.

Partnerships such as the University Trailblazer Program are critical to launching Australia’s technology into the market. But Li-S Energy founder Dr Lee Finniear, who developed its lithium sulphur battery with Deakin University, hopes the budget has carved out funding for a gigafactory to produce batteries for electric vehicles on a large scale.

“In Australia we are now behind the eight-ball,” Dr Finniear said.

“Europe has over 40 large gigafactories in construction or operation. We have none – zero – and our ambition as a country is not matched by action at the level that is needed.

“Plus we have advanced battery technology invented here, so we could be a powerhouse in advanced batteries, with the materials, scientific know-how and opportunity. We just need the commitment from government to partner with new industry to create a multibillion-dollar industry, rerisk our road to carbon zero, and supply thousands of new technology, well-paid jobs.”

Crypto calling

How the government can position Australia as a technology hub amid the global change is evident in the unregulated and fast-moving world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.

Over the past 12 months, Treasury’s internal blockchain regulation capability has ballooned from three people working on crypto regulation to more than two dozen.

Following last year’s Senate Committee report on regulating digital assets, Treasury has signalled it is likely to launch a token mapping project as a first step to better define different token types.

The industry, which has been plagued by disingenuous crypto offerings alongside its ambitious technical development,- is eager for regulation and support that will establish a valuable industry onshore.

“I hope to see the budget deliver measures that recognise the urgency for Australia to move forward with crypto/blockchain specific initiatives in the region.” Jonathan Miller, managing director of Kraken Australia, a cryptocurrency exchange, said.

“Australia has the opportunity to become a market leader in fintech competition and crypto/blockchain technology, but only if we sustain the right regulatory environment and support mechanisms for businesses in the space that help continue to drive innovation, competition and success here, as well as attract top-tier talent.”"

Mr Chalmers said inflation will be the primary influence on the budget, which will have three objectives: responsible cost of living relief, strengthening the economy, and beginning budget repair.

""This budget will do more than baton the hatches against global uncertainty,"" he said.

""It will back in families and begin to build a better future that Australians need, deserve. This budget is for Australians who battle through hard times and believe in a better future and we will keep faith with them tonight.""

Prior to the election, Labor pledged to deliver childcare reforms, cheaper medicines and wage increases in a suite of measures to ease rising cost of living pressures.

Mr Chalmers said following through with Labor's election commitments will build a ""stronger, modern, and more resilient economy"".

“We know that Australians are counting on us it’s an opportunity to put an end to a wasted decade of missed opportunities and messed up priorities,"" he said.

“We’ll be implementing the commitments that we made to the Australian people before the election, and those commitments around cheaper childcare, those commitments around cheaper medicines, investing in skills, investing in cleaner and cheaper, more reliable sources of energy. They will be central components of the budget I hand down tonight.""

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Tuesday the government will hand down ""a family friendly budget that delivers for working Australians"".

“The priority will be on measures that boost the economy, that boost productivity,"" Mr Albanese told reporters.

""Cheaper childcare does just that, so does paid parental leave, so do our measures in investments that are targeted and sensible, on infrastructure investments, investments like improving the National Broadband Network that will boost our national economy.

“We want an economy that grows, but grows in a way that takes pressure of families by not adding to inflation, and that’s why tonight’s budget will deliver for working families.”

The 2023 federal Budget delivers a handful of brilliant initiatives for parents and those looking to buy a home and gives funding to a new National Anti-Corruption Commission. It also commits $1.6 billion to support women’s safety.

But looking through a Gizmodo Australia lens, we’ve got a few tech-adjacent announcements to sink our teeth into.

2023 federal Budget: Technology

While there are no big ticket tech items in the 2023 Budget, such as the 2021-22 Digital Economy Strategy, this year, the government is committing to deliver 480,000 fee-free TAFE places ($871.7 million over five years) to address skills shortages and a $50 million TAFE Technology Fund to modernise TAFEs (this will include modernising IT infrastructure, workshops, laboratories, telehealth simulators and other facilities at TAFEs across Australia).

“Learning skills for jobs in priority areas like the care sectors and the digital economy,” Treasurer Jim Chalmers said while delivering his Budget speech.

A focus on supporting women’s workforce participation and advancing gender equality is also on the list.

The government will provide $15.4 million over four years (then another $2.8 million per year ongoing) to establish the Startup Year program to deliver income-contingent Higher Education Loan Program loans to up to 2,000 recent graduates, postgraduate and final year undergraduate students per year.

There’s also the promise of 20,000 additional university places for disadvantaged Australians. Adding to this is $474.5 million over two years to support student well-being and improve classrooms.

The 2023 federal Budget provides $47.2 million over six years to support the development of talent and leadership in Australian science and technology. They’re going to use $13.5 million to “identify, assess and support Australian development of critical and emerging technologies” and $5.8 million to get more women into STEM roles. Questacon is getting $10 million and quantum computing is getting $4.8 in the form of PhD research scholarships.

As announced at the Jobs and Skills Summit, the government will increase the 2022–23 permanent Migration Program planning level from 160,000 to 195,000. This will help ease widespread, critical workforce and skills shortages. Priority will be given to offshore applicants and on-hand applications for the Skilled Independent visa – New Zealand stream.

In crypto (there’s always crypto), the government will soon introduce legislation to clarify that digital currencies (such as Bitcoin) continue to be excluded from the Australian income tax treatment of foreign currency.

The government will increase penalties for breaches of competition and consumer law to deter conduct that stifles competition and increases costs to consumers. Maximum penalties for corporations will increase from $10 million to $50 million per breach, and from 10 per cent of annual turnover to 30 per cent of turnover (whichever is greater) during the period the breach took place. This is great news for consumers.

Interestingly, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner is receiving $5.5 million over two years to investigate and respond to the Optus data breach.

Still on cyber and the 2023 federal Budget allocates $31.3 million to extend the whole of government Cyber Hubs pilot while an evaluation is completed. The pilot is trailing a whole of government approach, utilising four Cyber Hubs to deliver cyber security capabilities to Commonwealth entities.

The 2023 Budget will provide $12.6 million over four years to combat scams and online fraud. Funding includes $9.9 million to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission for initial work on the establishment of a National Anti-Scam Centre, $2 million for the Department of Home Affairs to expand its arrangement with IDCARE to provide specialist identity support services and $700,000 will be used to raise public awareness of the risk of scams.

The ACMA, meanwhile, will get $27.7 million over five years to deliver a new spectrum management system and auction capability for spectrum licences.

$757.7 million over five years has also been set aside in the 2023 federal Budget to improve mobile and broadband connectivity and resilience in rural and regional Australia. Mobile base stations will be built out with $400 million of this funding, $200 will go towards delivering telecommunications infrastructure in regional areas and $30 million will help farmers connect to the world. $2.5 million of this kitty will be used to establish a First Nations Digital Advisory Group to lead consultation with First Nations people on the design and delivery of digital inclusion initiatives.

Already announced was Labor’s $2.4 billion NBN investment to help with network upgrades, but there’s also another $4.7 million over three years to support the delivery of free broadband for up to 30,000 unconnected families with school-aged students.

$6 million will also go to the Alannah and Madeline Foundation for the national rollout of the eSmart Digital Licence+, Media Literacy Lab and a new Junior Digital Licence+ to improve media and digital literacy and online safety awareness among primary and secondary school students.

While the National Anticorruption Commission isn’t usually something we’d cover, the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity (ACLEI) is getting $27.5 million, with some of that earmarked to develop a secure and independent ICT environment in preparation for transition to the Commission.

The government will also provide $30 million as part of the 2023 federal Budget for the Robodebt Royal Commission.

The government has also earmarked $217.7 million to abolish the Cashless Debit Card, and commence transition to voluntary income management. And $800,000 will be used to audit MyGov.

In the health space, $3 million over three years will be provided to extend and expand the Rare Disease Telehealth Nurse Program, to assist patients with rare diseases to navigate the health system. The Therapeutic Goods Administration is also getting $23.3 million to help it build a better IT system to monitor and track medications and medical devices.

Australian-based Blockchain Global launched the ACX exchange in 2016 after it failed to get listed on the Australian Securities Exchange for filing inaccurate and misleading information about its investors and financial position.

ACX exchange offered trading services for customers to deposit their fiat currency and trade cryptocurrencies. However, it pooled all customers’ funds into a single account and failed to keep a detailed record of each customer’s holding.

In October 2021, the crypto exchange froze withdrawals for customers as it went bankrupt and owed creditors up to $50 million.

Ongoing investigations at the Supreme Court of Victoria reveal that ACX took the funds deposited by customers and intermingled them with the company’s money. Subsequently, it made withdrawals from the pool to fund other business endeavors owned by Blockchain Group.

Former Blockchain Global CTO Jin Chen testified that the company’s record was poor as it could not distinguish between the bitcoin holdings of each customer.

Chen added that he was instructed by the company co-founder Allan Guo to transfer bitcoin from the pool of customer funds to other parts of the business.

“Allen instructed me to send 100 bitcoin to an employee at the time of Blockchain Global Ltd and I understood it was for a collateral purpose,” Chen said.

As a result, the company used over $20 million of customer bitcoin to fund its transactions while leaving the customers at a loss.

The Qoin Facility is a non-cash payment facility established in January 2020.

Qoin can be bought and sold exclusively through Block Trade Exchange in exchange for Australian dollars at a pre-determined price or used to buy goods and services.

Both Qoin and BTX are owned by BPS Financial Pty Ltd.

Misrepresentation and unlicensed conduct

The regulator stated that the company made false, misleading, or deceptive representations when it informed more than 79,000 individuals and entities issued with Qoin tokens that the digital currency could be exchanged for cryptocurrency or Australian dollars via independent exchanges.

This occurred against a background of increasingly restrictive limits imposed on the exchange process on the BTX Exchange over time.

BPS also made untrue statements to lead consumers to believe Qoin tokens can be used to purchase goods and services with a growing number of merchants when the number was falling.

BPS is also operating without compliance with financial services laws, and the application used for transactions is not registered, regulated, or approved in Australia as BPS claimed, alleged ASIC.

BPS Financial Limited’s Director Tony Wiese said in a statement that they disagree with “the position of ASIC and will be defending the matter.”

“Our focus remains to develop the Qoin project technology and ecosystem,”

He added.

ASIC said the maximum penalty can run up to millions of dollars and that it would also seek an injunction from the Federal Court to stop BPS from promoting Qoin.

f1e33030-9ee4-4e06-838f-e7fc3106da1e,"The US dollar has weathered another suspected blast of Japanese intervention to rise against the yen, while European markets got a lift from hopes that US interest rates could rise more slowly than previously thought.

The dollar roared to 149.70 yen in early trade before hastily retreating to 145.28 in a matter of minutes in what traders and analysts said appeared to be at the hands of the Bank of Japan. It was last down almost 1 per cent at 149.24.

The Financial Times reported the BOJ may have sold at least $30 billion on Friday to try to protect the yen from yet more weakness, which has sharply lifted the cost of Japan's imports, particularly for resources.

Japanese authorities again declined to confirm whether they had intervened, but the price action suggested they had.

Any action to support the yen runs counter to the BOJ's commitment to controlling Japanese government borrowing costs and could increase the pressure on it to step back on yield curve control at its policy meeting this week.

Sterling, meanwhile, see-sawed in volatile trade on news Boris Johnson had dropped out of the running for British prime minister.

Former finance minister Rishi Sunak, who is the market's preferred candidate, has emerged as the front-runner for the job, which could reduce some of the political uncertainty hanging over the pound.

The news initially saw sterling jump almost a cent to $1.1402, but it could not hold and was last trading at $1.1328 as investors waited for more clarity on the contest. The leadership could potentially be settled later on Monday if Sunak becomes the only candidate to secure the minimum number of MPs' votes required to progress.

Markets are still priced for a rise of 75 basis points next month, but have scaled back bets on a matching move in December. The peak for rates has also edged down to around 4.87 per cent, from above 5 per cent early last week.

Stocks in Europe opened on an upbeat note, with the STOXX 600 up 0.7 per cent on the day, ahead of a week of packed earnings, as 118 companies, including big guns like HSBC, Unilever and TotalEnergies are set to report.

Chinese blue chips slid almost 3 per cent, while the offshore yuan hit another record low against the dollar after Xi Jinping secured a precedent-breaking third leadership term, picking a top governing body stacked with loyalists. Xi is likely to stick to his zero-COVID policy that is damaging growth, analysts say.

Delayed data on gross domestic product (GDP) showed the Chinese economy grew 3.9 per cent in the third quarter, above forecasts for 3.5 per cent, but retail sales disappointed, with a rise of 2.5 per cent.

Markets now await figures on US GDP due on Thursday and core inflation measures the day after. The economy is forecast to have grown an annualised 2.1 per cent in the third quarter, while the Atlanta Fed GDP Now indicator rose to 2.9 per cent in the latest week, from 2.8 per cent.

Sentiment will also be tested by some major earnings with Apple, Microsoft, Google-parent Alphabet and Amazon all reporting.

The European Central Bank meets this week and is widely expected to raise its rates by 75 basis points, though it is less clear whether it will signal a further such move in December. ""Although we do not expect any 'dovish' policy signal, we maintain a bias towards a lower rate path than currently priced by markets,"" said analysts at NatWest Markets in a note.

""We forecast +50bp in December and +25bp in early 2023 to a 2.25 per cent peak,"" they added. ""There is more uncertainty around QT (quantitative tightening), where beginning sales in Q1 2023 could well be announced.""

The euro was off a fraction at $0.9835, having briefly been as high as $0.9899 early in the session.

The Bank of Canada is also expected to tighten by 75 basis pointsat its meeting this week.

The possibility of a slowdown in US rate increases helped bonds pare some of their recent heavy losses, with US 10-year Treasury yields easing to 4.16 per cent compared to a 15-year peak of 4.337 per cent on Friday.

Australian house prices will fall 11% by mid next year, and by up to 20% by the end of 2024, the Reserve Bank of Australia says. It will be the largest hit to the property market since the early ’80s and strip billions from households, the SMH reports, but on the plus side, more Australians could become first-time homeowners. It’ll come as our economy is headed for a rude shock next year, The Australian ($) reports, with inflation and the global turmoil seeing 3.25% GDP growth in 2022-23 before falling to a measly 1.5% in 2023-24 (a full point lower than April’s forecasts). Why? Weaker household spending driven by the high cost of living, the AFR says. But we’re not headed for a domestic recession like the UK, Europe, US and China probably are, Treasurer Jim Chalmers swears — to that end, he’s promised a “responsible”, “sensible” budget this week.

So what are we in for? Chalmers says we’ll save $10 billion in the “rorts and waste” audit, Guardian Australia continues, mostly Morrison-era projects. It’ll see things like the Monash rail project and the Wellington Road upgrade (in former education minister Alan Tudge’s electorate) on the chopping block, as well as $2 billion repurposed from the Coalition grants program — that’s stuff like the Building Better Region Fund and the Commuter Carparks Fund, the AFR adds. Interestingly, the ADF is getting $1.17 billion for new recruits in the budget, NT News says, and will begin a grassroots campaign in schools and universities and across social media. But the government is tightening the belt more broadly — with a $3.6 billion cut to external labour, government advertising, travel and legal expenses, which comes as MP Bob Katter has taken the crown for claiming more taxpayer-funded Comcar services than any other minister or backbench MP in the last quarter, Guardian Australia reports — some $35,000.

RATS. SINKING. SHIP.

It just got harder for NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet to win the state election. NSW Transport Minister David Elliott will quit politics at the March state election after being edged out by internal factional Perrottet rivals, the SMH reports. He joins other outgoing pollies including Infrastructure Minister Rob Stokes and Customer Service Minister Victor Dominello. But the former army captain isn’t bitter, telling the paper his “days of throwing spears” are over because when you leave politics you need more friends than enemies. One anonymous Liberal said it was bad news for Perrottet — more “internal turmoil” making preselections riskier.

Elliott certainly got his fair share of headlines — in 2019, he was accused of grabbing a teen in a minor collision with his car, Guardian Australia reports, and declaring he worked for the cops (not quite: he was police minister), though an investigation cleared Elliott. As the emergency services minister, Elliott also came under fire for going on an overseas holiday during the Black Summer bushfires, as the SMH reports (he turned around at Heathrow Airport). Then in February this year, Elliott famously went to bed the night before Sydney’s infamous train shutdown, the AFR reports, while his department was still debating the decision.

RINEHEARTLESS

Billionaire Gina Rinehart’s Hancock Prospecting has pulled its $15 million sponsorship from Netball Australia (NA). It comes after some Diamonds players objected to the possibility of branding being splashed across their uniforms — Indigenous player Donnell Wallam, in particular, was uncomfortable considering Rinehart’s father, Lang Hancock, made terrible comments about sterilising Indigenous peoples in an ’80s documentary. After pulling the funding, Hancock Prospecting’s statement was fairly strongly worded — it said the sponsorship would’ve generously boosted the wages of players, and that it was “unnecessary” for sport to be used for social or political causes: “There are more targeted and genuine ways to progress social or political causes without virtue signalling or for self-publicity.” Somewhat ironically, Hancock Prospecting very publicly donated $1 million to a telethon hours later, which raised a new record of $71.4 million overall, as The West Australian ($) reports.

Netball Australia’s Players Association boss Kathryn Harby-Williams said it was a major shock, and that everyone was extremely disappointed, news.com.au reports. Harby-Williams reckons everyone was fine to wear the logo during the Constellation Cup, just not during the three-match series against England. WA Premier Mark McGowan urged Rinehart to reconsider it as her decision also saw WA-based team West Coast Fever lose a $2 million sponsorship deal from her company Roy Hill, Perth Now reports. McGowan says “reconciliation” could see the deal go ahead. But Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he hopes someone else will step up to sponsor NA, saying netball was an important sport in the country. NA has four months to sort it out before the funding is pulled.

ON A LIGHTER NOTE

It’s 1932 in the harsh expanse of Western Australia, and armed soldiers hardened by their service in World War I are preparing to face off with another, much more unpredictable foe: the emu. Some 20,000 of the flightless birds had been snacking on local crops, much to the ire of farmers, and the defence minister Sir George Pearce had declared military might was the only way. The soldiers dutifully trekked into the scrubland, but the emus were precision-trained in guerilla tactics, immediately scarpering and disorienting the soldiers. Their bullets seem to just bounce off the prehistoric birds — one incredulous soldier later wrote: “They can face machine guns with the invulnerability of tanks.” It quickly became clear the mission was futile, a failure, and the shamefaced soldiers retreated, embedding within Australian lore forever the Great Emu War — the emus recorded as history’s official victor (they really are). But did we have the world’s second-largest bird all wrong all this time?

Raspberry farmer Craig Woods thinks so. Eight years ago, Woods brought home a fluffy mob of emu chicks to raise as pets on his acreage, a chemical-free operation that uses only solar power. His lifelong fascination with the birds was rewarded with a special bond with one in the brood, Einstein the Emu, an amber-eyed guy who wants a little cuddle from Woods each morning. And Woods has no problem with that. The emus turned out to be an incredible asset on his environmentally friendly farm, he tells the ABC, eating their body weight in insects to keep the balance just right. When a locust plague tore through a few years ago, he popped the emus into a paddock and the peckish birds just “cleaned them up”. Forget man’s best friend — Woods reckons emus can be imprinted on cattle, sheep and chickens to become some sort of beady-eyed security guards, once even chasing a bloodthirsty fox right through the paddock with their razor-sharp talons. The emus, it seems, are not to be trifled with — even the cuddly ones.

Wishing you the acumen of a victorious emu this morning.

THE COMMENTARIAT

Journalists shun inconvenient news stories on the environment — Chris Mitchell (The Australian) ($): “Newsroom rounds have changed so much during the digital age that many reporters now only write what their audience wants to hear. The change is profound in environment journalism. Once a great environment writer such as the late Brian Woodley, from this paper, would have excellent contacts in the conservation movement, but would also have relationships of trust with industry. Such rounds-people could write stories critical of companies doing the wrong thing but also take account of jobs and development priorities. They could write favourably of some environmental campaigns but criticise misleading ones.

“Today environment lobby groups own the opinions of too many environment writers. It’s the same in other areas such as education, where reporters are beholden to the teacher unions, or immigration and asylum seeker news, where immigration lawyers and asylum seeker advocates dominate coverage. Partly this reflects the relative strength of the public relations business and the declining state of newsrooms as thousands of journalists have left the media. It’s easier for a well- funded advocacy group to get its message into coverage than it is for news editors to seek out difficult stories with scarce reporting resources. Consider for example the likely impact on the natural environment of the expansion of wind and solar power generation, all the land that will be required and the resources, particularly rare earths, that will need to be mined. It’s surely a fascinating subject, but it’s difficult.”

‘Who fills the void?’: why player power in sponsorships is dangerous for sport — John Wylie (The SMH): “A time-honoured principle of Australian sport is that no individual is bigger than their sport. It’s a reflection of our national love of sport and our spirit of egalitarianism. The recent phenomenon of sports stars in elite teams rejecting or distancing themselves from national sponsors risks turning this principle on its head. Individual athletes seem to now have the power to decide who or what’s appropriate or inappropriate for a national team or entire sport. The team dynamic that is an integral part of team sport magnifies the risk. One player’s issue can quickly become one for the whole team, motivated by the noble urge to stand shoulder to shoulder, in the solidarity that is the essence of team success.

“While no one doubts the bona fides of the individuals, the validity of their personal concerns, or their genuine desire to advance the best interests of the game they love, it’s a poor development for sport, in multiple ways. Commercial sponsorships, even those focused just on the elite level as in cricket and netball, impact the financial competitiveness of entire sports, down to the grassroots. Grassroots sport made the elite athletes of today, so when they get to the top of their game, they in turn have — or should consider themselves to have — an absolute responsibility to do what they can to advance future investment in those grassroots. It’s the right thing for the tens of thousands of kids starting out who want and deserve the best possible opportunity in the sport. Which means maximising the sport’s revenue base, at all levels, and helping secure the financial future of the game.”

As inflation remains too high, interest rates will surely continue to increase in the coming months, the RBA’s deputy governor Michele Bullock revealed last week.

“Interest rates need to rise to ensure inflation returns to the 2 to 3 per cent band over time and inflationary expectations remain anchored,” she told a conference in Sydney.

By Stephen Culp

NEW YORK, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Wall Street advanced on Monday, building on last week's gains as signs of economic weakness suggested the effects of the Fed's aggressive policy aimed at cooling the economy, thereby curbing decades-high inflation, are beginning to be felt.

All three major U.S. stock indexes were higher at the top of a week jam-packed with high profile corporate earnings and crucial economic data.

A report from S&P Global showed a contraction in business activity this month, offering a hint that the Federal Reserve's barrage of steep interest rate hikes are having their desired effect, raising hopes that the central bank could begin slowing the pace of increases to the Fed funds target rate.

""We’re getting some follow-through from what we saw last week, this idea that while the Fed might not be pivoting, perhaps the cadence could be slowing in terms of rate hikes,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. ""There seems to be some idea that the rate environment is not going to be as aggressive as we move into next year.

""That idea seems to be causing investors to put money back into the market,"" Carlson added.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 374.23 points, or 1.2%, to 31,456.79, the S&P 500 gained 34.73 points, or 0.93%, to 3,787.48 and the Nasdaq Composite added 40.21 points, or 0.37%, to 10,899.92.

Among the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, healthcare was enjoying the largest percentage gain.

Tesla Inc dropped 3.4% after the electric automaker cut prices for its Model 3 and Model Y cars by as much as 9% in China, signaling softening demand in the world's largest auto market.

Third quarter earnings season shifts into overdrive this week. So far, nearly one-fifth of the companies in the S&P 500 have reported. Of those, 74.7% have delivered consensus-beating results, according to Refinitiv data.

Analysts expect S&P 500 earnings growth of 3.0%, on aggregate, down from 4.5% at the beginning of the month, per Refinitiv.

Results from a slew of heavy-hitting tech and tech-adjacent companies are likely to dominate the earnings chatter this week.

06966dda-c330-4363-b858-ee0a1b8544af,"A four-decade bull run in developed-market government bonds has come to an end — leaving traders to deal with the impact of huge planned bond sales by central banks into volatile markets.

Yields on government bonds in major markets have soared this year, as investors reacted to higher-than-expected inflation, sharp interest rate hikes, and the looming unwinding of trillions of dollars of central bank bond-buying carried out since the financial crisis.

According to Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid, at a global market level, government bonds are now in their first bear market for more than 70 years. The yield on 10-year UD Treasuries has risen from less than 1.5 per cent to around 3.8 per cent this year. Yields rise as prices fall.

As many central banks rapidly tighten monetary policy, the US Federal Reserve is stepping up the pace by winding down its nearly $9tn balance sheet, which was built up through years of quantitative easing stimulus. It plans to shrink it by $95bn a month. The European Central Bank has also been discussing shrinking its €5tn bond portfolio.

The likely impact on bond markets from these looming bond sales is unclear. However, with markets already under pressure from interest rate rises — which have created large price swings in these previously stable assets — there are fears that the additional supply of bonds could suck cash out of the system and make trading even more difficult.

Quantitative tightening is “very clearly a constant cloud”, says Ritchie Tuazon, fixed income portfolio manager at Capital Group — although he adds that, given how well quantitative tightening has been flagged to investors by central banks in advance, it is “hard for me not to believe it was already in the price”.

Even so, he believes the planned selling could make trading harder. “It’s adding to volatility,” he says. “It makes liquidity a little bit poorer.”

Liquidity in the US Treasuries market has fallen to its lowest level since spring 2020, when markets were in turmoil at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, according to JPMorgan data.

Recent turmoil in the UK gilts market, sparked by former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng’s announcement of unfunded tax cuts in September, has only added to concerns about the fragility of bond markets, generally.

With the volume of gilts that must be absorbed by investors already set to rise sharply due to UK government borrowing, plus the replacement of quantitative easing with quantitative tightening, “it is not surprising” that Kwarteng’s announcement “caused a great deal of nervousness”, says Peter Sleep, senior investment manager at Seven Investment Management.

The ensuing volatility, and fears that forced selling by pension funds could create a downward spiral, forced the Bank of England to intervene in markets with the purchase of up to £5bn of bonds a day.

That meant a delay to the bank’s planned quantitative tightening — or bond selling — programme. It had been the buyer of 57 per cent of bonds issued by the UK government between March 2009 and June this year, according to Bank of America.

Following the BoE’s intervention, a change of chancellor and the reversal of most of the planned UK tax cuts, gilt yields fell, although as of Thursday, when prime minister Liz Truss resigned, they remained above where they were before Kwarteng’s “mini” Budget.

The UK turmoil spread into US and European bond markets, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury posting its biggest one-day rally since March 2020 — even prompting speculation among some in the market that the Federal Reserve could follow suit and pause quantitative tightening.

“QT will make this worse,” says one senior hedge fund executive, echoing the fears of a number of investors.

Investors are already having to take action to protect themselves against a lack of buyers or sellers and the higher cost of carrying out a trade.

“It’s causing us to trade less,” says Tuazon. “We’re still in the markets every day. But, as the bid-offer [spread] widens out, the bar to trade gets higher.” That means the expected return on a position needs to be higher for him to invest, although market volatility means bond prices can move further, which could improve returns on a position.

We’re still in the markets every day. But as the bid-offer widens out, the bar to trade gets higher

“The anticipation of QT is why you’re seeing concerns about liquidity,” says Pilar Gomez-Bravo, director of fixed income for Europe at MFS Investment Management, adding that volatility in the gilts market means the threshold for putting on a trade has risen. “You’re having to rely on long-only investors to buy bonds [during QT]. That paints a really tough picture going into year-end.”

It remains to be seen how determined policymakers are to stay the course on quantitative tightening in the face of market volatility. The Bank of England has ended its temporary bond-buying programme although a new short-term lending facility is set to continue until November.

Nevertheless, some investors see benefits from the bond sales and the slow reduction in central banks’ influence on markets.

Tatjana Greil-Castro, head of public markets at Muzinich & Co, points to the potential for better price discovery in markets such as German Bunds, where there has long been a shortage of securities to trade.

“There [are] not sufficient Bunds in circulation to have a well-functioning repo market,” she says. As bonds are sold, “there will be more free float . . . This would mean the actual Bund yields would more closely reflect fair value.”"
0cf0447c-8b17-4bfa-9489-0cb2a45904c9,"













BENGALURU, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Turmoil in global sovereign bond markets is set to persist for another six months to a year as central banks carry on raising interest rates to bring down inflation, according to a Reuters poll of market strategists.

More than a year after inflation started to become a worry and a little over six months since the U.S. Federal Reserve finally made its first interest rate hike from near zero, there is scant sign of price growth becoming less of a threat.

Since the Fed first moved, bond markets have been subjected to high levels of volatility and deep sell-offs, jolting many bond investors out of their complacency.

The ICE BofAML U.S. Bond Market Option Volatility Estimate Index (.MOVE), which began rising late last year, hit its highest level since March 2020 last week. This trend of great uncertainty is set to continue.

Over 65% majority of bond strategists, 14 of 21, who answered an additional question in a Reuters Oct. 19-21 poll said the current turmoil in sovereign debt markets will persist for at least another six to 12 months, including one who said it would last one to two years. The remaining seven said less than six months.

""We're probably in for at least another year of significant volatility in bond markets...(and) it could definitely be more,"" said Elwin de Groot, head of macro strategy at Rabobank.

""Volatility is not going to go away anytime soon. Even when central banks are starting to move closer to that pivot point, so to speak, we may have other sources of uncertainty keeping volatility in markets high. And high volatility means higher risk premiums.""

With most major government bond yields up more than 200 basis points since the start of the year and most central banks well past the half-way point of their expected tightening cycles, yields may come down over the next 12 months.

The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield was expected to drop from its 14-year high of 4.27% hit on Friday to 3.89% by year-end. It was then forecast to fall further to 3.85% and 3.58% in the next six and 12 months respectively.

But those median forecasts were higher than in September's poll, suggesting yields are still facing upside risks.

That is largely down to the U.S. Fed's unrelenting effort to tamp down inflation, which is currently running multiple times higher than its 2.0% mandate.

""In the current paradigm, inflation is simply too high for them (the Fed) to show any reluctance in being very, very hawkish,"" said Benjamin Jeffery, rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets.

Despite the marked difference in hawkishness between the Fed and its nearest peers like the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, benchmark yields on German bunds and UK gilts have risen in tandem with U.S. Treasuries.

German bunds hit a fresh 11-year high of 2.49% on Friday, as worries over rising interest rates weighed on debt markets, with the ECB expected to deliver a jumbo 75 basis-point hike again this week.

The poll expected bund yields to drop slightly from their current levels to 2.10% by end-2022 and then rise slightly to stay around 2.20% in the following six months. They were then forecast to fall back to 2.10% in a year.

The UK gilt market was subjected to a severe thrashing when the government announced a wave of unfunded tax cuts on Sept. 23, stoking fears of fiscal imprudence and sending benchmark borrowing rates to a 20-year high.

Investor confidence has been somewhat restored with most of those measures now reversed. The then finance minister was fired and the prime minister has resigned.

Gilt yields were expected to rise from 3.90% currently and trade above 4.00% over the next six months. They were forecast to ease back to 3.80% in a year.

e543a3aa-4374-41cd-9dbc-2a3a4ff95b79,"Dear Liz: Now that interest rates on savings accounts have started to rise, I have a quick tip for you to share: Check the rate you’re getting on your accounts! I discovered my online bank changed its account structure a few years back, and legacy high-yield savings accountholders aren’t getting the recent increases. I was earning only a paltry 0.3% rate, while people who opened accounts more recently were earning over 2%. I’m sure many customers like me assumed they had high-yield accounts, since that’s what they opened originally, but they are, in fact, not receiving competitive rates.

Answer: Thank you for the heads-up. People who have certificates of deposit also should check whether those CDs have matured. Some banks renew the CDs at competitive rates, while others dump the proceeds in a low-rate account. A little vigilance can help you squeeze out a much better rate of return.

A spouse’s debt, your credit score

Dear Liz: My spouse and I have added each other as authorized users on our credit cards. My spouse has more debt than I do. Does this impact my credit scores?

Advertisement

Answer: Possibly. Credit scoring formulas look at how much available credit is being used on each account. If your spouse has higher balances than you but also higher credit limits, your credit scores may not be harmed much, if at all. If, on the other hand, your spouse is using most of their available credit, your scores could suffer.

Most services that provide credit scores (including possibly your bank and your credit cards) typically offer some explanations about why your scores aren’t higher. If the explanations include anything about excessive credit utilization, you may want to consider getting yourself removed as an authorized user from the problematic cards.

Sorting out IRA taxes

Dear Liz: My traditional IRA contains both pre-tax and after-tax contributions. (Some years I was ineligible to deduct contributions because I was participating in an employer’s retirement program.) Now I am retired and am considering making Roth conversions from the traditional account. I admit I was a little careless about keeping track of the total after-tax contributions. For the past 10 years or so, I have been using one of the more popular tax programs and was letting it track the tax basis and file the Forms 8606. I recently reconstructed all of my IRA contributions since 1985 to check the basis and discovered that the amount the software had calculated was short by about $15,000. Is it possible to correct this so that I don’t end up paying tax on the wrong basis?

Answer: Yes, but this could be a difficult process, according to Mark Luscombe, principal analyst for Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting.

As you know, when making Roth conversions you’re required to pay income taxes on the portion of your IRA that represents deductible contributions plus any earnings. But you don’t have to pay taxes on the portion of your account that represents your nondeductible contributions — that is what is known as your tax basis. A higher basis means less taxes, so correcting this may be worth the effort.

You’ll have to go back and correct each Form 8606, working from the oldest year, Luscombe says. The corrections need to reflect the traditional IRA contributions for that year, including the dollar amount, any deduction taken and the return of any excess contribution.

Send the corrected 8606s to the same service center where you will send the tax return for the conversion. If you’ve taken any distributions from the account, your calculations for the taxable portion may be in error as well. You can correct that for the past three tax years, but you won’t be able to recover the excess tax paid in any previous years, Luscombe says.

REGION – Having some money set aside may provide a sense of security, but many people often feel insecure when it comes to how to actually save that money. Interest rates rise and fall, and the economy can ebb and flow like the ocean’s tides.

The Federal Reserve, or Fed, which is the United States’ most significant central banking system, raised interest rates from 1.5% to 1.75% in June, which was the largest rate increase since 1994. This economic institution manages and maintains the US money supply and financial transaction system, while setting up monetary policies and overseeing bank operations. They also help maintain financial markets. What a bank charges another bank for an overnight loan is called the Federal Funds Rate, and if this goes up, other interest rates will also follow suit shortly after.

The bad news first



When interest rates go up, this means an increase in credit cards, adjustable-rate mortgages, home equity loans, and other interest-bearing costs.

Occasionally, when the Federal Reserve rate goes up, some banks might not raise the yield on savings accounts, or if they do, it might be a small increase.

When it becomes too expensive to obtain a loan due to a higher interest rate, people spend less money on those big-ticket items like cars or home improvements. Spending less money leads to the economy slowing down, which can hurt company growth and stock prices.

With a higher interest rate, people end up paying more for their car, home and items purchased on a credit card. Often, home prices drop due to the decline in demand that comes with increased interest rates, so if a senior is looking to sell their house and reap the benefits of a big profit, it would probably be better to wait.

Here’s the good news



Many seniors live off their savings, and if their cache is earning more interest, that’s a plus. Having money in a savings account that is FDIC insured is considered a safer way to earn a little more interest. The higher interest rates also mean that savings accounts, money market funds and CDs will all yield higher amounts.

When interest rates increase, this could bring in more foreign investments, causing the US dollar to become stronger. With a lower interest rate, the rate of return goes down over time. This means having to put aside more from a paycheck to reach that retirement goal.

“There is an upside to inflation, especially for those who use savings accounts and CDs,” said Susan Moore, chief financial planning officer at Moore Financial Advisors in Watertown. “Online savings banks such as Ally Bank or Synchrony Bank are paying much more than they paid on savings a few months ago. Rates have gone from 0.5 percent a few months ago to 1.5 to 1.75 percent. Also, retirees are likely to see another sizable increase in their Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) for their Social Security payments in 2023.”

“Based on research conducted by the Senior Citizens League, an advocacy group for retired individuals, a Social Security COLA adjustment for 2023 of 10.5% is possible, which would add an extra $175 per month to the average benefit,” Moore explained. “The last time Social Security benefits rose by 10 percent or more was in 1981. This is generally good news. But for retirees with higher incomes, there are some things to be aware of when income is expected to rise in the coming year,” she noted. “The boost might result in having to pay more in Medicare premiums and for prescription drug coverage due to the Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount (IRMAA).”

Be sure to talk to a financial planner or look for a retirement calculator to see how any investments dependent on interest rates are affecting your specific investment plan. Higher rates may make it easier to achieve your goals. But when rates are lower, waiting too long could make it more difficult to recover from any losses suffered. If possible, if you’re still trying to build your retirement savings, consider contributing more each year to help reach that savings goal.

(Reuters) -Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk thinks a recession will last until the spring of 2024, he tweeted on Friday, after saying earlier this week that ""a recession of sorts"" in China and Europe was weighing on demand for its electric cars.

""Just guessing, but probably until spring of '24,"" Musk said on Twitter after a user asked him how long the recession would last. It was not clear if Musk was talking about a global recession or expanding on the comment on China and Europe he made on Wednesday.

Shares of Tesla Inc slid 6.6% to close at $207.28 on Thursday, a day after Musk told analysts on a conference call that the weakness in China and Europe was causing demand to be ""a little harder than it otherwise would be.""

At least six brokerages lowered their price targets on the stock, with Tesla bull Wedbush Securities making the biggest cut of $60 to bring its price target to $300. Tesla's third-quarter revenue on Wednesday missed analysts' estimates.

While Musk told analysts that Tesla has ""excellent demand"" for the current quarter, the EV maker said it would miss its annual delivery target due to limited transportation capacity.

Earlier this month, Tesla said it delivered a record 343,830 EVs in the latest quarter. But not only did that miss analysts estimates of 359,162, it also fell short of Tesla's production of 365,923, a rarity for the automaker whose deliveries have been higher or similar to production in many of recent quarters.

Musk flip-flopped on demand during a July conference call, saying at first that macroeconomic uncertainty might have some impact on demand for its electric vehicles, but when pressed for details by an analyst, he said the company did not have a demand problem but a production problem.

Musk said he had a ""super bad feeling"" about the economy and that Tesla needed to cut about 10% of staff, according to a June email seen by Reuters. Later, he said the reduction would apply only to salaried workers.

Story continues

Tesla shares have lost more than a third of their value so far this year. They fell as much as 9% to hit a 16-month low on Thursday.

""The results will likely add to debates about demand destruction that ensued after 3Q deliveries tracked -5% below company-compiled consensus,"" JP Morgan said in a report.

Tesla missed automotive gross margin expectations on Wednesday, as costs to ramp up production at its new factories in Berlin and Austin weighed.

""The bullish narrative is clearly hitting a rough patch as Tesla must now prove again to the Street that the robust growth story is running into a myriad of logistics issues as opposed to demand softening,"" Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said.

Sterling rallied on Tuesday on improved risk sentiment as Rishi Sunak became Britain's prime minister, while the dollar dropped to a three-week low as weakening U.S. economic data tempered expectations for the pace of future U.S. rate hikes.

The potential for volatility is elevated in the foreign exchange market this week, with central banks in the euro zone and Canada expected to hike rates by 75 basis points, and the Bank of Japan set to maintain ultra-low interest rates to support its fragile economy.

Rishi Sunak became Britain's third prime minister in two months on Tuesday, tasked with tackling a mounting economic crisis and a warring political party.

Sterling surged to its strongest level since Sept. 15, and was up 1.74% at $1.1471, but currency strategists expect the pound to remain under pressure.

""Beyond a brief honeymoon phase rally, I think the daunting road ahead for the UK economy is likely to cap sterling gains,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Convera.

The U.S. dollar was broadly weaker amid signs that Federal Reserve rate hikes are slowing the world's biggest economy. The greenback slid into negative territory after data showed that U.S. home prices sank in August as surging mortgage rates sapped demand. read more

""The housing data being weak just drives home the view that the Fed after November may adopt a slower pace of rate hikes and that has left the dollar a little bit vulnerable over the short term,"" Manimbo said.

The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six major peers, was down 0.99% at 110.88 at 4:01 p.m. ET.

The euro strengthened to a 20-day high, with the ECB looking set to raise rates by 75 basis points on Thursday as it seeks to rein in red-hot inflation. read more

The common currency was up 0.91% at 0.9965.

""Warm weather is fuelling (relative) optimism about the energy crisis, even if Germany's IFO data is deep into recessionary territory,"" said Kit Juckes, chief FX strategist at Societe General.

e627fb3c-4202-4915-818f-7ae73e6a92ad,"Japanese authorities intervened in the currency market again Friday during New York trading to stem the yen's slide against the U.S. dollar, following its first such attempt in 24 years last month, sources close to the matter said Saturday.

The country's currency surged within hours Friday in New York, with the rapid swing fueling speculation that Japanese authorities intervened for the second time.

But market participants say such efforts will only help slow the pace of the yen's slide and do little to reverse its weakening trend as long as a gap between U.S. and Japanese interest rates is expected to widen."
d636abac-7beb-4722-a3aa-fa5db30f2f2a,"The Japanese yen suddenly rallied against the U.S. dollar on Friday amid reports and widespread speculation that Japan’s Ministry of Finance and Bank of Japan had intervened to prop up the yen after the currency tumbled to a fresh 32-year low against the greenback.

Earlier in the day, the yen had weakened more than 1% against the dollar to as low as 151.95 yen, its lowest level against the dollar currency since July 1990. However, just minutes before the 4 p.m. London “fix,” which is the closest thing the currency market has to a daily close, the currency pair suddenly reversed.

However, the yen then strengthened USDJPY, -1.24% , rising more 2% to 147.26 yen to the dollar at its highest level of the session.

Market analysts quickly weighed in to say that the move appeared to be the result of direct intervention in currency markets, with some speculating that Japan’s Ministry of Finance might be selling U.S. Treasurys or dollars to prop up the yen.

“It certainly feels like it’s intervention,” said Bipan Rai, head of FX strategy at CIBC Capital Markets.

Additionally, Japanese news organization Nikkei reported that the Ministry of Finance and Bank of Japan had indeed intervened to support the falling yen, citing anonymous government officials.

Conditions were ripe for Japanese authorities to intervene, Rai said, given the lower liquidity levels on a Friday afternoon and the fact that the dollar was already under pressure following an earlier report in the Wall Street Journal which signaled that the Federal Reserve might downshift to smaller interest-rate hikes after the November policy meeting.

The move in the yen comes after the Bank of Japan carried out unscheduled emergency bond-buying operations on Friday for the second straight day, according to a Reuters report, after the yield on 20-year TMBMKJP-20Y, 1.123% and 30-year TMBMKJP-30Y, 1.520% Japanese government bonds TMBMKJP-10Y, 0.256% rose to the highest level since 2015, while the 10-year yield briefly broke above the BoJ’s official ceiling of 25 basis points earlier in the week.

Earlier this week, Masato Kanda, Japan’s vice finance minister for international affairs, told reporters that Japanese authorities wouldn’t openly announce future interventions to support the yen. He also said that the MoF was “always ready to take necessary action as excessive volatility has become increasingly unacceptable,” according to Reuters.

The move comes after Japanese core inflation rose to its highest level in eight years according to data released overnight. On a year-over-year basis, Japan’s core consumer-price index climbed to 3% in September, up from 2.8% the prior month, according to FactSet data.

Jon Turek, the founder and CEO of JST Advisors, said Japan’s rising inflation would increase the pressure on the BoJ to compromise on its ultra-loose monetary policy, although he said it would be impossible to anticipate when the central bank might throw in the towel.

“I don’t have a strong view on when they throw in the towel. It’s hard to say considering there’s been no inclination from the BoJ that this could happen,” Turek said.

When it comes to intervention, Turek said the easiest thing for the MoF to do to prop up the yen would be to sell their massive Treasury holdings.

After the latest inflation print, investors will be paying close attention to what BoJ chief Haruhiko Kuroda might say during next week’s policy meeting, which concludes next Friday. The BoJ is expected to release an update to their macro forecasts after the meeting next week, which could offer some insight into the bank’s thinking, especially the numbers surrounding inflation.

There has recently been chatter about the MoF carrying out “rate checks” — meaning the ministry has been calling large currency dealer desks to check the prices on the dollar-yen, Turek said.

The strategy has long been used by Japanese authorities to try and move the dollar-yen pair without having to intervene directly.

Foreign investors have repeatedly tried to pressure the BoJ and MoF to capitulate by shorting Japanese government bonds and the yen this year, but so far, Japanese authorities have fended off these speculative attacks by buying more bonds and backstopping the yen when the pace of its decline becomes “disorderly,” Turek said.

“It’s not clear that they have a line in the sand at 150 that says ‘though shall not cross’,” Turek said. “They just didn’t want the yen to go to 150 in a mess.”

But the problem with direct intervention is its effects are usually not long-lasting, with market analysts anticipating that the dollar could soon reverse the move, barring more concrete action from the BoJ or the Fed. Indeed the move was already reversing Friday afternoon in the U.S."

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar handed back some of its gains in early European trading Wednesday, while the euro rose on the back of soaring German producer prices.

At 03:05 ET (07:05 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, fell 0.1% to 112.823, retreated after an overnight surge of nearly 1% as the U.S. Treasury yields soared.

The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to continue its aggressive interest rate hikes at its next meeting in early November, as it attempts to curb red-hot inflation.

Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans emphasized the need for further action in a speech on Wednesday, saying ""making sure that we've got monetary policy at a sufficiently restrictive stance so that we're not inducing inflation -- we're trying to get it down -- that's the objective at the moment.""

The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose to 4.154% early Thursday, its highest level since mid-2008, while the 2-year Treasury yields touched a 15-year high of 4.582%.

USD/JPY edged up to 149.94, just below the 150 level and the pair's highest level since August 1990, as the markets remained on high alert for any signs of intervention.

Japanese authorities intervened in the foreign exchange market last month to buy yen for the first time since 1998, at around the 145 level.

EUR/USD rose 0.2% to 0.9787 after German producer prices rose by 2.3% on the month and by an eye-watering 45.8% on the year, as companies again passed on sharp increases in their energy costs to buyers.

The numbers show sustained inflationary pressure in the economic pipeline and add to the pressure on the European Central Bank to keep raising interest rates despite the obvious slowdown in the Eurozone economy.

The ECB should lift borrowing costs by 75 basis points at its next two meetings in October and December, Governing Council member Boštjan Vasle said Wednesday in an interview.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar surpassed the symbolic level of 150 yen for the first time since 1990 on Thursday, while the British pound turned negative in choppy trading after Liz Truss said she would resign as the United Kingdom's prime minister.

The Japanese currency dipped sharply from an interim high of 150.09 reached in overnight trading, tumbling to 149.63 within a minute, which raised speculation that the Ministry of Finance and Bank of Japan might be making stealth interventions at key levels.

The yen rebounded to hit new 32-year highs in afternoon trading in New York, however, getting as high as 150.25. It last traded at 150.18.

While the likelihood of any intervention is an open question, some analysts think that such a move would not stop the currency from weakening further absent a shift in the Bank of Japan's ultra-dovish policy.

""Until you see either the BOJ change their tune, or if we start to see the U.S. economic outlook deteriorate a lot quicker that will help the Fed finally deliver that Fed pivot, you're going to see that the bet against the yen is still the favorite trade in FX,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York.

The Federal Reserve is expected to continue raising interest rates as inflation remains stubbornly high, with some forecasting its benchmark overnight interest rate to peak above 5%. The rate is currently in the 3.00%-3.25% range.

Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said on Thursday the central bank is not done with raising its short-term rate target amid very high levels of inflation, while adding it was likely the U.S. central bank will find space next year to pause the tightening process and take stock of how its rate increases are impacting the economy.

The housing market has been one of the most affected sectors from higher rates even as other sectors including jobs remain solid. Data on Thursday showed that sales of existing U.S. homes slid for an eighth straight month in September.

Expectations of higher rates have sent U.S. yields and the dollar higher, particularly against the yen as the BOJ is committed to keeping interest rates near zero.

Japanese policymakers made fresh threats of intervention on Thursday. They are seen as more likely to step in if currency moves become more erratic.

""The (Ministry of Finance) has been very clear that they are ready to intervene if there is any disorderly price action, so the markets are priced for that coming at some point in time,"" said Derek Halpenny, European global markets research head at MUFG.

""Obviously, if we break clearly above 150 we may see some disorderly price action and that could be the catalyst for some action,"" he added, though emphasizing it would take a sharp move in the pair to trigger intervention.

The BOJ will hold its next policy meeting on Oct. 27-28.

The British pound turned lower on the day after Truss said she would resign as prime minister. She was brought down by the announcement of an economic program that sent shockwaves through the markets and divided her Conservative Party just six weeks after she was appointed.

The pound rallied ahead of the resignation announcement, and later hit session highs, before changing course and turning lower. It was last down 0.05% on the day at $1.1219.

""Initially, this is likely to take an uncertainty premium out of the market, but it depends who takes over, you need a steady hand at the top,"" said Viraj Patel, global macro strategist at Vanda Research in London.

The dollar index dipped 0.10% against a basket of major currencies to 112.86, which analysts said was likely due to consolidation. The euro gained 0.13% to $0.9785.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.33% or 99 points, the Nasdaq was down 0.85%, and the S&P 500 fell 0.67%.

Big tech dragged the market lower, with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) leading to the downside after the 10-year Treasury yield jumped to 14-year highs on bets the Federal Reserve is likely to persist with its aggressive rate hikes.

“Against persistent core inflation pressures, the Fed is on track to continue tightening at a faster pace than originally anticipated,” Morgan Stanley said in a note, forecasting the Fed to hike rates by 75 basis points in November, 50bps in December, and 25bps in January.

Sentiment on tech, however, was boosted somewhat by blowout results from Netflix as the streaming giant reported third-quarter results that beat on both the top and bottom lines as subscriber growth resumed.

Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) added 2.4 million net subscribers and guided net adds of 4.5 million for the fourth quarter, prompting some on Wall Street to suggest that the company’s trend of subscriber losses were over.

“Netflix was un-ownable when net adds turned negative, and while there will always be ebbs and flows in the slate, it's now tough to see loss in future years,” Wells Fargo said in a note.

International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) reported quarterly results that beat on both the top and bottom lines.

Fears over slowing software spending, however, were eased somewhat after Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) reaffirmed its guidance for the third quarter, sending its shares up more than 2%.

Consumer products giant Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) climbed nearly 1% after its quarterly results beat on both the top and bottom line, overshadowing lowered full-year revenue guidance amid a hit from a stronger dollar.

Consumer discretionary stocks fell amid pressure from homebuilder stocks after the data showed further signs of slowing in the housing market.

U.S. homebuilding fell more than expected in September, while mortgages demand fell to the lowest level since 1997 following a surge in interest rates.

PulteGroup Inc (NYSE:PHM), DR Horton Inc (NYSE:DHI) and Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN) were down more than 5%.

The strong dollar continued to loom over currency markets, with the yen sinking to a 32-year low against the greenback. Investors braced for intervention as the Japanese currency fell below 150 for the first time since 1990.

US 10-year Treasury yields touched a 14-year high, while 2-year German government bond yields rose to their highest since December 2008.

""There is a concern the economy over the course of the next 12 months are going to be extraordinarily difficult, with the mood slightly pessimistic when it comes to corporate earnings,"" said Mike Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets.

Investors were readying for anticipated hefty rate hikes from the European Central Bank next week, and the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England in the following week, Hewson said.

The MSCI all country stock index was down 0.2 per cent, adding to its 25 per cent drop so far this year, wiping out the gains clocked up in 2021.

In Europe, the STOXX index of 600 companies was down 0.5 per cent, down almost 20 per cent for the year so far, as downbeat earnings from chip equipment firm BE Semiconductor and telecom company Nokia fuelled fears of economic slowdown.

Eren Osman, managing director of wealth management at Arbuthnot Latham & Co, said earnings so far in the United States and elsewhere have shown resilence as many companies beat expectations.

But earnings are likely to fall next year which, along with anticipated interest rate hikes in the United States and elsewhere, are already largely priced into markets, Osman said.

""Once we start to see the ISM manufacturing data start to trough, the markets will get some confidence that we have seen the worst of it. A lot of people are waiting for that moment of capitulation and it might not happen,"" Osman said.

Asian shares fell on Thursday to their lowest since April 2020 as risk appetite among investors faded after inflation data across the globe re-ignited fears of aggressive interest rate hikes by the Fed.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell as much as 0.8 per cent, leaving it down about 29 per cent for the year.

NEW YORK, Oct 20 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks whipsawed and benchmark Treasury yields continued to climb on Thursday after investors weighed generally upbeat earnings against the possibility that the Federal Reserve will maintain its aggressive policy stance for longer than previously hoped.

All three major U.S. stock indexes reversed an earlier rally, sinking into negative territory after remarks from Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker suggested the central bank will ""keep raising rates for a while."" Harker's comments also helped support the 10-year Treasury yield's march past 14-year highs.

Financial markets have now fully priced in yet another 75 basis point interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve when it meets next month, according to CME's FedWatch tool.

A spate of mixed quarterly corporate results and economic indicators provided some evidence of economic slowdown, but a dip in jobless claims showed the Fed's aggressive campaign of interest rate hikes has had little effect on the tight U.S. labor market.

Overall, earnings have been positive,"" Detrick said, adding that the reporting season so far is ""still suggesting we are likely not in a recession and the economy is still moving forward, just a little slower that we’d like.""

NEW YORK, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks closed higher and Treasury yields dipped on Tuesday as upbeat earnings and better-than-expected factory data stoked a risk-on rally.

Building on Monday's broad gains, the S&P 500 led the major U.S. stock indexes higher to end the session up nearly 1% or more, with sectors across the board advancing.

Meanwhile benchmark Treasury yields were last lower, having oscillated throughout the day.

""The market was a bit oversold leading into Monday, and people were worried of what was going to happen over the weekend. People walked into the week feeling a little better,"" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth in Fairfield, Conn. ""You're getting a combination of short covering and fear of missing out.""

Better-than-expected quarterly results from Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Johnson & Johnson and Lockheed Martin set the tone, with robust industrial output data providing signs of economic strength even as central banks tighten monetary policy to tackle inflation.

The belief that ""a recession is coming and the Fed is going to be raising interest rates, with the hope that maybe a pause is going to be coming something next year,"" is now baked into the market, Pavlik said. ""Without all that weight, the market can rise higher after being sold off.""

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 337.98 points, or 1.12%, to 30,523.8, the S&P 500 gained 42.04 points, or 1.14%, to 3,719.99 and the Nasdaq Composite added 96.60 points, or 0.9%, to 10,772.40.

Monday's policy reversal from British finance minister Jeremy Hunt's continued to buoy investor sentiment.

European shares extended their policy U-turn rally - with an assist from the tech sector - to close modestly higher on the day.

The 30-year bond last rose 1/32 in price to yield 4.0142%, from 4.015% late on Monday.

The British pound dipped after surging nearly 2% on Monday, which propped up the greenback against a basket of world currencies, but the dollar was last essentially flat, its gains held in check by risk-on investor sentiment.

The average price tag on a UK house hit a new record high of £371,158 in October despite the mortgage rate rises that followed the mini-budget.

The average asking price on a home in the UK increased by £3,398 month-on-month, according to Rightmove, which said shortages of property for sale are continuing to underpin prices.

The property website said that surging interest rates are causing some prospective homebuyers to delay their decision.

Demand for buying new homes has fallen by 15% in the last two weeks, in the wake of the mini-budget that rocked the UK economy.

About 1,000 mortgage deals were removed from sale by lenders last month, after former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng’s mini-budget on 23 September spooked financial markets and prompted expectations of far higher interest rates.

While buyer demand was still 20% higher than in the same period in 2019, it had fallen 15% compared to the same two weeks in 2021.

Tim Bannister Rightmove’s director of property science said: “Some aspiring first-time buyers will have had their plans dashed by the sudden nature of the mortgage rate rises, and now face a difficult situation with rents also rising, and a shortage of available homes to rent.

“Buyer demand was already starting to soften and higher interest rates were anticipated but they’ve been brought forward sharply due to market uncertainties.”

He added: “It’s understandable that some new movers who have the option to wait may want a clearer view than they’re getting right now before they proceed with a major purchase such as a home.

“With uncertainty over where mortgage interest rates will go, those who can still afford to proceed may decide that waiting too long could come at an even higher cost than taking action to move now, especially if the level of demand continues to outstrip supply and supports prices.”

Rightmove reported a rush of buyers trying to complete sales before mortgage offers fixed at prior lower repayment rates expired. Prices were reduced on 23% of homes on sale, compared with 21% last month.

The property website said asking prices were likely to drop in November and December, in line with normal seasonal price changes, and that there were “more economic events to play out” before forecasting the market in 2023.

Matt Powell, a branch manager at Royston and Lund estate agents in Nottingham said: “The long-term repercussions of the mini-budget announcement are probably still too early to see in real time, although they had a dramatic and almost immediate impact on mortgage interest rates.

“Those with transactions under way are keen to see them through and complete their deal quickly with the rates already secured.

“Some buyers are actively having to re-evaluate their borrowing options quickly and while we haven’t seen the appetite to buy dwindle too much, some buyers’ ability to proceed has been thrown into question.

“That being said, demand is still outstripping supply for the time-being, so as long as properties are priced correctly, activity levels are still strong.”

Interest rate rises have reduced how much money buyers are able to borrow, and experts are predicting major falls in property prices.

This will place greater pressure on first home buyers juggling the difficult decision of when to enter the property market, financial comparison site Canstar said.

The latest house price predictions from NAB and ANZ forecast total property price falls of around 20 per cent across the capital cities by April 2023 - from their peak in April this year.

Westpac predicted a fall of 16 per cent, while Commonwealth Bank expected prices to fall around 15 per cent.

Canstar finance expert Steve Mickenbecker said the decision to buy while house prices were predicted to fall would be adding to the pressures for first home buyers and he cautioned buyers to weigh up all the risks before choosing the right time to buy.

“A move to buy too soon will see first home buyers’ equity plummet alarmingly and leave them with a large debt,” Mickenbecker said.

“Conversely, being conservative may see them miss out if price projections have been too alarmist.

“Price uncertainty is undoubtedly adding greater pressure to the decision for first home buyers, who can alleviate some of the fears by setting their own price target for buying.”

How much would prices fall?

If the 20 per cent decline in property prices came to a head, prices in Sydney could decline as much as $144,876 by Christmas 2023.

With the median house price falling from $1,053,131 to $908,255.

Prices in Melbourne could fall as much as $135,906 - bringing the median price from $774,531 to $638,625.

Those looking to buy in Brisbane would see prices drop $105,019, from $746,017 to $640,998.

In Adelaide, property prices were expected to fall $112,307 from $649,983 to $537,676.

Perth was expected to see a drop of $87,438 from $558,879 to $471,44.

Finally, property prices in Hobart were predicted to fall ​​$143,445 from $705,079 to $561,634.

What it means for current homeowners

Property price falls don’t just impact potential buyers but also those who already own, Mickenbecker said.

“Housing price falls too will pass and borrowers who can afford repayments can wait it out, even if it may take years before they are ahead of their buying price,” he said.

“But borrowers who aren’t able to meet their repayments and who have low equity, can’t expect generous patience from their lender.”

The report also found 2.7 per cent of residential customers, or 170,547 households, had their electricity bills unpaid after 90 days.

The AER found vulnerable customers cost the energy sector about $645 million a year – a number which was also set to rise in line with power prices.

Ms Savage said there were “systemic failures” in the current energy market which was often too hard for the average customers to navigate.

“We have a very complex system which contributes to and compounds some of the vulnerabilities which customers experience,” she said.

The AER report has made a number of recommendations to increase transparency for vulnerable customers including reducing complexity, increasing consumer protections and improving affordability for all consumers by reducing retailers’ costs to serve customers.

Some of the more radical ideas proposed included a reinsurance pool for energy companies to help them provide better services for consumers or a centralised service body to support customers experiencing vulnerability.

Ms Savage said she was concerned about low-income households bearing the brunt of the energy transition to net zero by 2050, saying poorer households simply could not afford to buy rooftop solar or batteries.

“The way people avoid rising energy costs by installing solar and batteries and sophisticated demand management, those opportunities are not necessarily readily available for households who might be in low-income housing,” she said.

“And it’s certainly difficult if you’re relying on understanding a complex system.”

She backed technologist and Rewiring Australia chief scientist Saul Griffith who told The AFR Energy & Climate Summit the federal government should subsidise households to help reduce the nation’s carbon emissions.

“I 100 per cent think the most important thing we can do as an economy is invest in energy efficiency,” she said.

“When you think about a transition to net zero, any energy you don’t consume, you don’t pay for and you don’t have to abate. So that’s a no-brainer, in my view.

“In terms of making sure that low-income housing has adequate energy efficiency, that will need support from government.”

It comes as a new global survey has found Australian businesses are facing increasing consumer expectations to do something on ESG priorities in the face of strong cost of living pressures.

The second annual SEC Newgate ESG Monitor – which covers more than 12,000 people in 12 countries, including Australia – found 81 per cent of Australians surveyed believed companies should be doing more to minimise their environmental impact.

Almost two-thirds of people said there should be some penalty for companies who underperform on ESG (Environmental Social Governance), but a similar number didn’t want companies to pass on the costs for better ESG performance.

At the same time, the survey found the rising cost of living was the major concern across all global markets.

“There is early evidence to suggest that soaring inflation and energy costs are impacting on community sentiment about the priority of ESG commitments over and above the pressing issues like ensuring secure and affordable energy and fuel and food supplies,” the report said."

Households are cutting back on power to pay for medicines and food, and many renters are being denied access to cheaper renewable energy and live in homes with poor energy efficiency.

A three-year strategy released on Thursday aims to better support those in hardship, reduce barriers to accessing new ways of powering a home or business and give consumers a say on the overhaul of system.

Many face unaffordable heating in winter and air-conditioning in summer, while the complex energy market is making it harder to understand choices that could cut power bills or unlock hardship support.

""I had no idea about payment plans or extensions until after I experienced my first disconnection,"" a single parent quoted in the Australian Energy Regulator plan said.

""Kids were hungry and upset ... I made excuses when my friends came over. It was horrible. I hated it.""

The number of consumers repaying energy debt has spiralled to more than 170,000 and the average debt upon entry to a company's electricity hardship program is $1690.

The average debt of those not in a hardship program has risen 56 per cent to $999, and many (65 per cent) of Australians are concerned energy will become unaffordable in the next 10 years.

The regulator's report, 'Towards energy equity - a strategy for an inclusive energy market', says Australians shouldn't miss out as the energy system undergoes profound change.

""It is critical that we don't leave consumers behind, and it's critical we apply new thinking,"" regulator chair Clare Savage said.

""If COVID-19 has taught us anything it's that vulnerable circumstances, whether they be financial, mental or physical, can touch us at any time.""

The energy sector has grappled for 30 years with how best to serve people with a disability, low incomes, poor literacy or suffer a life crisis and the mental health that often comes with it, she added.

""When your budget might allow a spare $5 or $10 a week, coming back from $2500 worth of energy debt would be almost impossible - it would certainly feel insurmountable,"" Ms Savage said.

""We also know that consumers experiencing vulnerability tend to be less able to adopt technology and modify their energy use in response to higher prices, and less able to shop around for a cheaper deal.""

The costs of energy vulnerability are also not distributed fairly across the system, the regulator found.

Currently, consumer-facing energy businesses are managing these costs on behalf of other sector participants including networks and generators.

Australia's energy ministers established a new National Energy Transformation Partnership in August that includes affordability as a priority.

Protecting vulnerable consumers and making sure all Australians can participate in energy markets is also the regulator's first objective in its strategic plan for 2020-25.

But energy costs continue to soar, and tariffs are expected to forecast to rise further in the years ahead."

Power prices will remain front of mind for most Australians. A global energy crunch has sent electricity prices soaring by 25 per cent on average, or $300, since April and they are forecast to rise a further 30 per cent next year.

The Australian Energy Regulator, which sets the rules for the energy market, said there were about 1 million searches executed on the comparison website in 2022 but of those, only about 5 per cent, or 70,000 people, switched their retailers.

The regulator already runs the Energy Made Easy website where customers can compare their current electricity deals with those from other retailers."

The relatively low wholesale prices we had during the pandemic are long gone, more than doubling between 2021 and 2022.

And if that paragraph wasn’t grim enough for you, the chief executive of one of the country’s largest energy retailers recently warned prices were likely to rise by another 35 per cent next year.

It’s not a great prognosis for Australians who are already struggling with the rising expense of almost everything else, including food prices, insurance, and mortgages.

Enlarge this image YURI CORTEZ/AFP via Getty Images YURI CORTEZ/AFP via Getty Images

The U.S. dollar is not just the currency of the United States; it's also, in many ways, the currency of the world. Around half of all global trade and finance is done using dollars. So when the U.S. Federal Reserve takes actions that affect the value of the dollar, it has spillover effects on countries around the world.

In the 1970s, many countries in Latin America borrowed heavily in U.S. dollars. Then, in the 1980s, the Fed hiked interest rates to record-high levels, which helped strengthen the dollar and, in turn, made it increasingly difficult for countries to repay those debts. Countries like Mexico, Chile, and Argentina fell into financial turmoil, and what followed was a period of economic turbulence and stagnation known as ""the Lost Decade.""

Now the Fed is hiking interest rates again, and the dollar is at its highest level in 20 years. So, how much has changed since 1982? We look at three countries in Latin America to see how the strong dollar is affecting them.

MILAN (Reuters) - Investors raised cash levels further in October to their highest in 21 years, as sentiment towards the economic outlook remained close to max bearishness, the latest global fund manager survey (FMS) by BofA showed on Tuesday.

BofA said however growing investor expectations of a change in central bank monetary policy indicate a 'big rally' is likely in 2023.

""FMS screams macro capitulation, investor capitulation, start of policy capitulation,"" BofA said, adding it expected the rally in the first half of next year, when interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve become the consensus position.

This change is already beginning. The share of investors anticipating lower short-term rates in the next 12 months doubled to 28% in October from September, while those seeing higher rates continued to fall from the early 2022 peak of 92% to 59% this month, it said.

As for now, cash levels rose to the highest since April 2001 at 6.3%, as investors stayed underweight stocks in anticipation of a recession and as market stability risk metrics reached an all-time high due to monetary and credit concerns, BofA added.

Westpac is closing down another 23 branches across Australia, including in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, Western Australia and South Australia.

The move will have a major impact on regional towns, with a number left without a local branch, according to the Finance Sector Union (FSU).

Impacted towns include Coober Pedy, Kapunda and Tailem Bend in South Australia, and Carnamah in Western Australia.

Hay in NSW will be left with just one local Commonwealth Bank branch when the Westpac branch closes.

“We need the Federal Government to step in and stop the banks from deserting regional Australia,” Julia Angrisano, FSU national secretary, told news.com.au.

“Banks can’t be trusted to do the right thing by regional communities because, when considering whether to close branches, they only consider their massive profits and the bonuses of senior executives.”

Other branches set to close include Campbelltown and Moree in NSW, Port Douglas in Queensland, Beaumaris, Endeavour HIlls and Gisborne in Victoria, and Katherine in the Northern Territory.

St.George, Bank of Melbourne, and BankSA - which are all owned by Westpac - are also set to close branches across Australia.

St.George is set to shut its Townsville and Cairns branches in Queensland, its North Sydney branch in NSW, and Weston branch in the ACT.

Bank of Melbourne is closing Melbourne branches in Greensborough, Prahan and Sunshine, as well as branches in Horsham and Shepparton.

BankSA is set to close branches in Kapunda, Tailem Bend, Greenacres and Port Adelaide.

95 branches closed

The move means Westpac will have closed 95 branches over the past four months, according to the FSU.

In addition, 92 jobs will be lost as a result of the branch closures.

Last month, the Regional Banking Taskforce called on banks to improve communication with communities affected by closures.

In its final report, it urged banks to ensure local councils were forewarned of any closures.

The latest branches to go are among 95 closed by Westpac over the last four months, Finance Sector Union National Secretary Julia Angrisano said in a statement.

A Westpac spokesperson said the closures had come about following a shift in consumer behaviour, with more customers choosing to bank online, resulting in a decline in the number of customer who visit branches in person.

Last month, Westpac group announced 24 branches would be closed, after another 24 were shut down in August.

Angrisano said the move had left staff at remaining branches fearful their bank would be next to close down.

Westpac Group, which includes St George Bank, Bank of Melbourne and Bank SA, is also closing branches of its subsidiaries.

“This is the most appalling decimation of a branch network by a bank which is now on the verge of abandoning its social contract with the community,” Angrisano said.

“Hundreds of banking jobs have been lost as Westpac rips through what’s left of its branches.

“Clearly, servicing the banking needs of customers is being ignored, as Westpac chases cost savings by cutting their bricks and mortar, and staffing costs.”

Angrisano said customers shouldn’t believe Westpac’s “spin” that the branches were closing because consumers prefer digital banking.

“These suburbs and towns are losing their bank because Westpac isn’t recouping enough profits from the sale of new loans, insurance policies and credit cards in their area,” she said.

“This process is particularly difficult for front-line staff.”

Staff at branches impacted by the closures told the union the changes were “emotionally exhausting”.

“The impact on the mental health of everyone working at the branch is huge and taking its toll,” one staff member said.

“We are remote, what our employment options look like is up in the air, we are all facing a very insecure future.”

Angrisano said the closures would have major impacts on those towns which are losing their last bank branch.

Hay in NSW will be left with just a Commonwealth Bank when the local Westpac branch closes.

“We need the federal government to step in and stop the banks from deserting regional Australia,” Angrisano said.

“Banks can’t be trusted to do the right thing by regional communities because when considering whether to close branches, they only consider their massive profits.

“They don’t care about bank staff and the communities which will be impacted by their decisions to shut branch doors.”

Westpac responds

A Westpac spokesperson said the closures had come about following a shift in consumer behaviour, with more customers choosing to bank online, resulting in a decline in the number of customer who visit branches in person.

“When we do make the decision to close a branch, we consider a range of factors including usage, location, and proximity to other banking services,” the spokesperson said.

“In these instances, we continue to support our customers by expanding access via digital and online banking, Bank@Post, telephone, mobile and virtual banking.

“For those who are new to digital banking, or may require more assistance with the changes, we provide dedicated support and education to make the transition easier.

“We’re continuing to invest in all our brands through creating a more connected branch network with new technology which means, for the first time, any St George, Bank of Melbourne or BankSA customer will soon be able to do their cash transactions at a Westpac branch, and vice versa.

“This builds on our ongoing program of co-locations where two Westpac Group branches are brought together under one roof.

“More than 30 branches have been co-located to date, enabling us to make a long-term commitment to providing employment and banking services in these communities, with new and improved branch sites opened in Dubbo, Lismore, Wagga Wagga and Stirling in recent months.”"

In the last financial year alone, 309 branches closed their doors, with Westpac to draw the shutters on outlets in Campbelltown, Moree, Port Douglas, Gisbourne and other locations in the coming months.

ATMs are also disappearing at a shocking rate, with less than half the number in Australian cities and towns than there was six years ago.

There are currently 6,412 ATMs across Australia, down from 13,814 in 2017.

The new figures come as Westpac announces it is set to close down another 23 branches across Australia, drawing the ire of the Financial Sector Union (FSU).

The closures are set to rock towns which are losing their last bank, such as Coober Pedy, Kapunda, Tailem Bend and Carnamah, according to FSU national secretary Julia Angrisano.

“This is the most appalling decimation of a branch network by a bank which is now on the verge of abandoning its social contract with the community,” Ms Angrisano told news.com.au.

More than 1000 branches have closed across the nation’s major cities, while 500 have been axed across NSW in the past six years.

Remote Australia saw its number of branches slashed by nearly a third, with only 102 branches left in those regions.

The Finance Sector Union said it had been notified of the closures and loss of 92 jobs across the Westpac group, including St George, Bank of Melbourne and BankSA branches.

Coober Pedy, Kapundah and Tailem Bend in South Australia, and Carnamah in WA will be without a bank, while Hay in NSW will be left with only a Commonwealth Bank when its Westpac branch shuts.

Other regional cities and towns losing Westpac group branches include Moree in NSW, Shepparton in Victoria, Port Douglas in Queensland and Katherine in the NT.

There will be closures in several city suburbs, including North Sydney and Weston, in the ACT.

The union said Westpac announced 95 closures in the last four months, leaving staff worried about their jobs and communities concerned about losing a vital service.

""This is the most appalling decimation of a branch network by a bank which is now on the verge of abandoning its social contract with the community,"" national secretary Julia Angrisano said.

""Hundreds of banking jobs have been lost as Westpac rips through what's left of its branches.""

A Westpac spokeswoman said the company redeploys staff after a closure and helps workers through counselling and career transition support.

It had followed Australian Banking Association guidelines on community engagement in the areas affected by closures, she said.

Westpac put the closures down to a shift towards online banking, leading to a decline in customers who use bank branches.

The federal government's Regional Banking Taskforce, set up under the coalition to examine the impact of bank closures on country Australia, handed down its report on September 30, finding many communities were unable to do basic business.

It found vulnerable people, including the elderly, disabled and Indigenous communities, faced greater challenges when banks closed their doors.

Farmers also suffer as they often rely on face-to-face contact with trusted bank managers to oversee their enterprises.

After the report was released by the incoming Labor government, the task force's co-chair, Nationals senator Perin Davey, said the inquiry could have gone further and regulated the operation of the last bank in a town.

The town of Berrigan in NSW recently lost its last branch, forcing the council to provide banking services at the expense of ratepayers.

Shire chief executive Karina Ewer said she had little faith the report's recommendations would change bank behaviour.

""Banks always say 'more and more people are moving online', but it's not a choice, we're forced to,"" Ms Ewer told AAP earlier this month.

3887b981-f393-4970-b993-26902d7b3ecd,"It’s been a nice few days for the stock market, with the S&P 500 SPX rising three of the last four sessions, including 4% over just the last two days. So the question, as third-quarter earnings season revs up, is just how long the good times can last.

Jeffrey Schulze, investment strategist at ClearBridge Investments, went down memory lane to look at the history of countertrend rallies, which he defines as rallies that ultimately give way to a lower low during bear markets. In fact, he says, there was one this summer, the 17% advance before Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s hawkish speech at Jackson Hole.

Two of the past three recessions saw even bigger countertrend rallies before the final lows were established.

He finds that there usually isn’t a market bottom until almost two-thirds of the way through a recession. “Recent labor market data suggests the recession has not even begun, meaning markets are likely to remain volatile as unknown risks start to unfold,” says Schulze.

Through Sept. 30, the peak-to-trough decline in earnings per share estimates was just 1.4%. During a recession, EPS declines reach an average of 25.8%, whereas outside of recessions, EPS declines are just 3.4%. Perhaps there’s good reason EPS estimates have not been marked down by much so far— a recent Duke University survey of chief financial officers found a record gap between the perception of their own companies versus that of the broader economy.

Schulze, however, is pessimistic, noting the rising risks from his firm’s recession risk dashboard (though it’s given false signals before). “We expect further weakening in the coming months as the lagged effects of Fed tightening continue to bite and the Fed continues to raise rates in its quest to curb high inflation,” he said.

“For equity investors, this could mean a recovery that sees false starts followed by subsequent selloffs. As a result, we continue to favor portfolio tilts toward quality and defensives until a clearer path forward for economic activity and earnings emerges.”

3c1cd5ed-0efd-4f32-9c16-288316293a79,"“That’s where our clients are going, and Magellan as platform is there to solve for client needs,” he said.

The former Future Fund deputy chief investment officer told shareholders that he had a plan to restore Magellan’s status as a $100 billion fund manager within five years through growing existing strategies and adding new products.

Magellan has seen its assets shrink from $117 billion in August last year to $51 billon as its fund performance has dwindled while key executives have left the firm under controversial circumstances.

His task began earlier this week as he oversaw a dramatic overhaul of the portfolio manager team, resulting in several senior staff departures.

The changes prompted a review from research house Zenith and came ahead of the AGM which has long been earmarked as the day he would lay out his plans for the firm. “The people are very good, and my observations around the investment philosophy and processes is that they’re in good shape. They do need a few tweaks and a bit of changes,” Mr George said.

Faith in research

He said Magellan’s research-driven investment approach will stand it in good stead.

Magellan shares have cratered by 80 per cent as its fund performance lagged further behind the benchmark.

Compounding its troubles was a series of controversial senior departures including that of chief executive Brett Cairns, and co-founder and talisman Hamish Douglass.

Chairman Hamish McLennan said the period surrounding Mr Douglass’ move to step down due to medical reasons had been both dramatic and unprecedented.

“What we were principally dealing with was a human and personal issue with an executive chairman who stepped down from medical reasons.”

“He was the co-founder of the business and in my 30 years of working in business, I’ve never encountered a situation like that.”

He said he was upset about the falling share price and that the board was committed to restoring value, but he admitted Magellan had suffered from “brand damage.”

“At its core, we believe Magellan should stand for outstanding investment advice and performance. If David delivers on that then the brand or bounce back.”

The bulk of the fund outflows have been in the global equities funds, which has meant that its Australian equities and infrastructure funds now account for half of the group’s $51 billion of asset under management.

Mr George said Magellan was looking to invest in “experienced quality teams” to replicate the success of Airlie, which has integrated well into the group, with an eye to adding equities and private market’s asset managers.

He said he had no intention of lowering management fees, which are higher than its competitors.

“If we deliver performance ultimately that sort of the piece of the conversation where fees come up, goes right down the list.”

Mr George said Magellan’s strong debt free balance sheet had supported it through a difficult period.

“Ultimately, perhaps it’s stronger than it needs to be. But what that means is, we’ll be able to continue with our on market buyback, we’ll be able to continue to pay dividends,” he said.

Mr George said there were no immediate plans to divest its holdings in Finclear and startup investment bank Barrenjoey.

“There’s plenty of confidence that there’s a great financial outcome there at minimum, and we’ll be patient around that.”"
dc94dd5c-3bc7-4c61-8cd4-cc8b743104b0,"George himself is part of this change; he was appointed chief investment officer on Monday in a surprise to the market, although he emphasises his role is one of oversight, and he will not be portfolio manager, as Douglass was.

“The key people in any one of those strategies, the ones that are making the day-to-day decisions, they are the PMs,” George told the Financial Review. “As CIO, I’m there to support them, ensure process is… the best it can be, and remove all the other distractions and let them get on with the job. That’s a cleaner accountability model, and it’s one, I think, that works better where we’re going to, we’re going to have a few different capabilities.”

The impact of these changes will take some time to play out. And several shareholders pointed out on Thursday, the pressure on fund flows looks unlikely to abate in the short term.

Challenges ahead

Indeed, complicating the task of lifting fund performance is George’s second test: how to navigate a huge change in the investment environment.

George is upbeat about this challenge, arguing where active stock pickers such as Magellan can outshine passive, index-hugging managers.

“The [environment] is full of uncertainty and that will reward proper stock research, proper economic research where you can build conviction and look through the roils in markets that are happening right now,” George says.

Magellan broadly, and Douglass particularly, have long argued that the firm’s management style works best in difficult markets, where protecting capital becomes important. But its FUM and its fame grew at a time when markets were being pumped up by cheap capital, and its bets on growth stocks shone. This time is now over.

George is right that the environment is ripe for stock picking, but only if you make the right calls. Get it wrong and rescuing returns gets even harder.

Energy in the mix

The final test concerns the growth strategy George outlined on Thursday, which will see Magellan expand its “core” range of lower-cost systematically managed funds to include a small-cap strategy and an energy-transition strategy, to its existing range of core strategies, which include a global fund, and infrastructure fund and an ESG fund.

One criticism of these low-cost products has been that they could cannibalise Magellan’s traditional products, which have much higher fees. But George sees it differently, arguing the core series provides a way for Magellan to take advantage of its large platform of economic and market research and broaden its offering. It will be cost-effective for Magellan, and George is confident he can still charge investors a premium over passive products.

The idea of leveraging Magellan’s economies of scale – George indicated he wasn’t looking to reduce investment staff numbers – has some merit. But whether it moves the FUM dial is another question. As with the global fund, much will come down to performance.

George says one of the biggest advantages Magellan has had over a difficult 12 months is its balance sheet. This could open up more opportunities, including a potential shift into private markets.

“Ultimately, perhaps it’s stronger than it needs to be. But what that means is we’ll be able to continue with our on market buyback, we’ll be able to continue to pay dividends. And in terms of the growth strategy, there’s plenty of scope to invest.”

“For me, it’s clear that retail clients or even institutions, they’re still on a journey of being more diverse – being a little bit less equities, bonds and cash and being a little bit more alternatives and a little bit more private markets. So, I think that’s where our clients are going, and Magellan as a platform is there to solve for client needs.”

That’s down the track, though. For now, all that matters is lifting performance numbers."

Industry Super Australia’s new analysis found 850,000 members who decided to stay with funds which had failed a performance test by Australia’s financial regulator each missed out on $1900 on average in the last year.

For those customers who continue to stick with dud funds, the losses could get even worse.

If a typical worker with a $50,000 super balance stuck with the poor-performing fund for another 10 years, they could be about $25,000 worse off.

If a 30-year-old remained with one of the dud funds for the rest of their working life, they could be $225,000 worse off at retirement.

Expert advice on how to make the most of your superannuation is to speak to your fund and compare long-term growth. Credit: Image Source / Getty Images/Image Source

Financial services regulator Australian Prudential Regulation Authority in 2021 tested all MySuper products and found 13 super funds worth about $56b failed based on poor investment performance, fees and costs.

While three failed products have since merged with better performing funds or are about to, the others remain in the system or will tie up with other funds that barely passed the test.

This year, APRA tested 69 MySuper products and failed five of them. Four of them failed for the second consecutive time and could now be banned from accepting new customers.

These dud funds cover about 600,000 member accounts worth about $28b and existing members who do not switch could be stuck with the fund indefinitely.

All funds that fail are forced to contact members and tell them to consider switching funds. However, the new analysis found 90 per cent of members stayed with the dud funds.

Industry Super Australia chief executive Bernie Dean said the findings served as a reminder of the huge cost of doing nothing if customers are in a dud super fund.

“Lots of people don’t know you can be stapled to a super fund that has failed the government’s performance test, and that could punch a huge hole in a person’s nest egg,” Dean said.

“Switching out of a dud fund and into a good one is easy, but plenty of people don’t think about it until it’s too late, so it is up to the government to tighten consumer protections, so people are only stapled to the best funds that have passed the performance tests.”

How to get the most out of your super fund

The findings come after a recent Money.com.au study of 1018 Australians found 60 per cent of participants said they would not have enough finances to set them up for retirement.

Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia CEO Martin Fahey said the best way to make the most of a super fund was to talk to the fund and get advice.

“If you’ve got more than one super fund, consider consolidating your fund,” he told 7NEWS.com.au earlier.

“Check the insurance on your fund to see if it is appropriate for you.”

Fahey also said to look at the investment option of the fund.

”If you’re a younger person you may be able to take a little bit more risk in terms of a growth option, otherwise you’re likely to be in a balanced option,” he said.

“You want to make sure your fund is invested in things that reflect what you’re concerned about from an ESG (environmental, social, and corporate governance) point of view, so is your fund pursuing strategies around renewables?

When looking for the top performing funds, Fahey advises to look at its performance over the last 10 years and longer.

“For the vast majority of people, superannuation is about three, four, five decades of investment returns,” he said."
2f01362b-edc6-4c40-a4a7-23086d95499a,"Superannuation returns moved sharply into negative territory over September, with experts predicting a “tougher calendar year” for super returns.

The average balanced fund with 60 to 76 per cent in accumulation phase fell in value by 3.1 per cent, according to SuperRatings.

For funds in pension mode, which rely more on bonds than those in accumulation mode, that translates as a lost 3.5 per cent in value over the month.

The September returns were weak as a result of falls in most markets, particularly Australian shares.

The SP ASX 300 index, which covers larger stocks, fell 6.3 per cent in value over the month, while the index for all stocks excluding Australia fell only 3.5 per cent.

Australian bonds fell 1.4 per cent while international fixed interest lost 3.5 per cent in value.

The listed Australian property index fell a massive 13.6 per cent and is down 21.1 per cent for the year to September.

The weaker super returns demonstrate the negative effects on investments resulting from rises in interest rates this year.

Although sharemarkets and super returns recovered strongly from the COVID-19 panic in early 2020, both have weakened since inflation concerns emerged.

Yearly returns down

The average balanced fund has actually lost 5.7 per cent in value in the September year while the previous year it rose.

The result means that the average super balance of $145,670 would have lost $8303 over the September year.

SuperRatings executive director Kirby Rappell said the first quarter of the financial year had seen volatility and overall “we are expecting a tougher calendar year for super returns”.

However “funds continue to have suffered more modest falls than equity markets, reflecting diversification in funds’ portfolios”.

Current volatility affects older fund members more than younger ones because those close to or in retirement have to cash in super investments when the market is weak.

For younger members, market volatility is only having an impact on paper, he said.

“Be prepared to see persistent volatility, while remembering that superannuation remains a long-term game,” Mr Rappell said.

Despite this volatility balanced super funds have returned an average of 7 per cent or better over time, he said.

The best-performing growth funds – the Qantas staff fund and HESTA’s sustainable fund – have returned 7.5 per cent and 7.03 per cent respectively over five years, new research from Stockspot shows.

But the picture for the worst-performing funds in the growth category has been very unpleasant.

Those low returns mean that performance is significantly eroded and leaving money in those funds will trash your retirement.

Indeed Stockspot CEO Chris Brycki advises all super fund members to check the level of fees their fund charges.

“You will improve your super balance by $245,000, on average, between the ages of 35 and 65, simply by moving from a super fund charging investment fees of 0.5 per cent per year instead of 1.5 per cent a year,” he said.

In the past it has been the for-profit retail funds that have charged higher fees while the not-for-profit industry and corporate sector have charged lower fees.

“I’d say that’s the case, although it has become less clear than it was 10 years ago.”

For-profit funds have been under pressure since the Hayne royal commission found many wanting and regulator APRA started to performance test funds.

Conversely, some industry funds had raised fees.

That has been in many cases a result of investing in more complex asset classes like unlisted assets, he said.

Those assets are more costly to invest in because they need managers that look closely at the detail of each asset while index-style investments just follow share or other market indices.

Those more costly assets have proved their value in recent times as they have fluctuated less in value than index products and some, like private equity, have generated higher returns than their listed cousins.

While many super funds are starting to merge, partly under pressure from APRA, the results of mergers weren’t necessarily positive.

“It doesn’t seem to be the case that the bigger you are, the better the returns,” Mr Brycki said.

Although some mergers resulted in better returns for members, others had not and in some situations merged funds “have actually increased fees”.

Overall, the Australian super sector is performing strongly.

Figures produced by actuaries Willis Towers Watson’s Thinking Ahead Institute earlier this year found that Australia has the second largest super sector as a percentage of GDP to the Netherlands.

Australians have retirement assets equivalent to 172.4 per cent of GDP, while the Dutch have 213.5 per cent.

Retirement assets under management also grew at a rate of 7 per cent annually.

Only the US and Ireland among developed countries had higher growth rates. But in the case of Ireland its overall retirement asset level was far lower.

British politicians at the top of government were the cause of the market chaos that followed the former Chancellor’s September fiscal statement and forced the Bank of England to intervene, according to the central bank’s deputy governor.

“The source of that mini-budget, and you could say of that period, was ministerial decisions on fiscal policy,” Jon Cunliffe, deputy governor for financial stability, told the Treasury Committee of UK lawmakers Wednesday.

Cunliffe’s comments firmly refute earlier claims by Prime Minister Liz Truss’s government that the shock was caused by “global factors.” Truss has since apologized for making mistakes.

Economists, asset managers and now the BOE have explicitly blamed the crisis on the £45 billion package of unfunded tax cuts with no accompanying independent forecast. The loss of fiscal credibility sparked the sell-off, Cunliffe said.

Former Chancellor of the Exchequer Kwasi Kwarteng’s package led to “yields rising across the curve,” he said. Kwarteng’s pledge for more reductions the weekend after the statement had a further impact on markets, Cunliffe added.

The chaos forced the BOE to step in with a multi-billion package within days to stabilize markets to prevent a collapse in asset prices causing an economic crash.

Also giving evidence to lawmakers, Andrew Hauser, executive director of markets at the BOE, laid out the speed of the market meltdown, as Liability Driven Investment strategy funds faced “a full-scale liquidation event.”

Calls with traders “went from ‘we’re ringing you to let you know‘ to shouting on the phone to us within two days,” Hauser said. “Friday was a conversation of ‘it’s been a bit tricky today.’ By Monday the tone was getting more worried, and by Monday evening I was just in back-to-back calls.”

Story continues

“That non-linearity from ‘this is more or less manageable’ to ‘this is completely out of control’ was something that happened over the weekend and into Monday and Tuesday.”

Cunliffe also revealed that the BOE’s Monetary Policy Committee “did not have a full briefing” of the contents of the plan before its rate-setting decision on Sept. 22. He said that “some elements” were briefed.

He stressed that responsibility for the plan rested with ministers, not Treasury officials. “It is the job of Treasury officials to advise ministers. In the end ministers take decision,” he said.

In response, Mel Stride, the committee chairman, queried whether the market panic could have been averted if the BOE had been briefed properly.

Had that happened, he said it was possible that the BOE “could have advised strongly against it, there might then a different decision that might then have spared us all a lot of grief over the last few weeks.”

Summary Finance minister warns will respond properly to FX moves - Jiji

BOJ board member Adachi says premature to remove stimulus

BOJ Kuroda says sharp, one-sided yen moves bad for economy

Monetary policy shouldn't respond to FX moves - BOJ Adachi















TOKYO, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Bank of Japan policymakers on Wednesday stressed the need to keep monetary policy ultra-loose to shield the economy from heightening overseas risks, ruling out the possibility of raising interest rates to slow the yen's slump to 32-year lows.

Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki also warned investors against pushing down the yen too much, saying the government would ""properly respond"" in the exchange-rate market, according to Jiji news agency.

In a speech on Wednesday, BOJ board member Seiji Adachi said it was premature to shift away from the central bank's ultra-loose monetary policy with Japan's economy facing mounting risks from slowing global growth and volatile financial markets.

Responding to short-term currency moves with monetary policy would heighten uncertainty over the BOJ's policy guidance and do more harm to the economy, Adachi said.

""When looking at the global financial and economic environment surrounding Japan, downside risks are building up rapidly,"" Adachi said in a speech delivered to business leaders in Toyama, central Japan.

""When downside risks are so high, we should be cautious of shifting toward monetary tightening,"" he said, warning that heightening external headwinds risked tipping Japan back to deflation.

BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda echoed that view, saying that monetary policy does not directly target exchange-rates, and Japan's fragile economy still needed massive monetary support.

""Sharp and one-sided moves in the currency market are undesirable for the economy,"" Kuroda told parliament. ""As such, it was very appropriate for the government to intervene in the currency market to address excessively sharp yen falls.""

The remarks by BOJ and government policymakers underscore the dilemma Japan faces, as the central bank's ultra-low rates aimed at supporting a weak economy help accelerate an unwelcome yen fall that inflates households' living costs.

The dollar rose as high as 149.415 yen on Wednesday for the first time since August 1990, moving closer to the key psychological barrier of 150.

The government, which holds jurisdiction over currency policy, spent 2.8 trillion yen ($19 billion) in dollar-selling, yen-buying intervention last month when authorities acted in the markets to prop up the yen for the first time since 1998.

Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has defended the BOJ's ultra-easy policy as a necessary step to support the economy.

He has also pledged to compile another spending package to cushion the economic blow from the rising costs of living, a sign fiscal policy will play a major role in combatting fresh downside risks to the recovery.

The BOJ, for its part, is facing renewed challenges in maintaining yield curve control (YCC), under which it pumps money aggressively to cap the 10-year bond yield around 0%.

The 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yield briefly hit 0.255% on Wednesday, rising above the BOJ's implicit 0.25% cap for the first time since June.

Yields for other maturities also came under upward pressure form rising global interest rates with the 5-year JGB yield briefly edging up to 0.105%, the highest since July 2015.

e32d3673-dcdd-49dd-a4f5-1e3c1cb6c557,"The tale began in 1944. World War II was at its peak in Europe. Amidst such insecurities, 44 allied nations convened in New Hampshire to establish the Bretton Woods System. Under the stipulations of the system, all countries adjusted their currencies to the US dollar while fixing the dollar to gold. They assumed that fixing a gold standard would reduce volatility in the global economy. Conveniently, that agreement also established US hegemony over global trade. However, by the early 1970s, that system collapsed as the US encountered a gold crunch.

The US faced a balance of payments crisis. The Federal Reserve did not have enough gold reserves to back the dollar. The infamous Nixon Shock ended the US dollar’s convertibility to gold.

The waxing and waning of the petrodollar

Henceforth, the US dollar plummeted as countries rapidly lost confidence in the greenback. This is the point that pivots the reality of today. In the mid-1970s, President Richard Nixon struck a deal with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to trade oil exclusively in dollars in exchange for US military assistance. Consequently, the petrodollar emerged, oil prices quadrupled, and the rest is history.

Ever since, the US dollar has been the undisputed exchange-reserve currency across the world. Agreements with Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Middle East reinforced the global oil trade in the greenback currency. Trading oil and gas futures, denominated in the dollar, entrenched the position of the US as the global superpower. While the euro surfaced as a strong contender in the 1990s, dollar-based finance continued to flourish. Developing economies like China and Russia had no choice but to hold US Treasuries and accrue massive dollar reserves to hedge currency risk. And, while fractious elements, like Iraq’s Saddam Hussein, and Muammar Gaddafi relentlessly attempted to derail the petrodollar, those efforts led to invasion, assassination, and decimation.

Can the Dollar Continue to Dominate in a Changed World?

READ MORE

Today, multiple geopolitical and economic factors are again turning the tide against the supremacy of the US dollar. Rapid globalization was already a ticking time bomb situation for the greenback. Now, China’s rise as the next potential economic powerhouse, Russia’s exclusion from the dollar-driven SWIFT system and a global economic slowdown are challenging the dominance of the US dollar.

The trend towards de-dollarization is not exactly a novel phenomenon. Latin America attempted to move away from the dollar in the 1990s. In response to US sanctions, Venezuela sought to pay for oil payments in Chinese yuan instead. Chile de-dollarized in the 1980s and generally avoided dollarization. In the early 2000s, Iraq attempted to sell oil in euros while Libya actively lobbied for years to forge a pan-African gold standard.

However, the global financial crisis of 2007-08 reversed this trend to de-dollarization. Over the last decade, no significant development emerged to diminish the dominance of the US dollar. With a rift emerging between the US and Saudi Arabia, the dollar faces a new challenge.

The US and Saudi Arabia drift apart

With 17.2% of global exports, Saudi Arabia is the world’s largest crude oil exporter. In the past, it was the biggest supplier to the US. It is because of oil that Saudi Arabia emerged as a core US ally in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia leads OPEC. In the past, this gave the US an indirect sway over global oil prices, which are denominated in dollars. This allowed successive American governments to run massive trade deficits and take cheap debt. Since 1979, the Saudi Kingdom has been a US proxy against Iran.

In the past few years, the US has boosted shale oil production and built up its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). In the 1990s, the US imported an estimated 2 million barrels per day. By 2021, this figure fell to mere 500,000 barrels per day, a fall of 75%.

Saudi Arabia and Lebanon: A Tale of Two Economies

Recently, the Saudi royalty has been particularly dissatisfied with US President Joe Biden’s policies in the Middle East. Biden’s decision to withdraw support for Saudi Arabia’s military intervention in Yemen annoyed Riyadh. Houthi attacks on Saudi oil facilities and Biden’s attempt to revive the nuclear deal with Iran has increased Saudi insecurities. Riyadh believes that the US is backtracking on the historic security guarantees to the House of Saud.

Biden’s recent Middle East tour was an abject failure. He failed to achieve his principal objective: get Saudi Arabia to increase oil production. Most recently, the White House has accused OPEC+ of aligning with Russia after this grouping of oil producers agreed to deep oil production cuts. In turn, OPEC+ has accused the West of “wealth arrogance” and hypocrisy.

China and others emerge as an alternative to the US

Over the years, China has emerged as the top importer of Saudi oil. In 2020, Saudi Arabia exported $95.7 billion worth of oil. China accounted for $24.7 billion of that figure while the US imports were a mere $6.59 billion. China’s Belt and Road Initiative has invested in Saudi Arabia and Chinese investments reportedly reached $43.47 billion in 2021.

Saudi Arabia is planning to invest in Chinese companies. Aramco has signed a $10 billion deal with Chinese petroleum companies. Talk of the petroyuan oil trade has hit the headlines. As of now, the $13.4 trillion eurodollar market and the $25 trillion US Treasury market offer depth and liquidity that no one else can match. Yet this could change in the future. Rising interest rates have strengthened the dollar, causing import bills of poorer economies to shoot up and triggering a global debt crisis. This might shake the global faith in the US dollar and at least China’s trading partner might become more amenable to trading in yuan.

China Will Decide Who Wins the Fight: Russia or the West

Russian President Vladimir Putin recently addressed the BRICS Summit, a grouping of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. He spoke of an alternate mechanism for international payments and an alternative to the International Monetary Fund’s Special Drawing Rights (SDRs). Instead of denominating against the dollar, countries could use a basket of their respective currencies instead.

Talk of Iran and even Saudi Arabia joining BRICS has emerged. Were this to happen, such a grouping would make up more than a third of the global GDP, over 25% of the global oil output, roughly 40% of the global iron production, and about half of the world’s agricultural production. Even a weakened Russia has caused havoc in global oil and commodity markets. An expanded BRICS with its own reserve currency could seriously challenge the dollar.

Russia and China are already engaging in ruble-yuan trade. Russian energy giant Gazprom recently announced that Beijing would start “making payments for Russian gas supplies in the national currencies of the countries — the ruble and yuan.” Frozen out by the West from SWIFT, Russia is now using China’s Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS). In due course, CIPS could emerge as a big winner of the Russia-Ukraine War. India is openly defying American pressure by increasing its oil purchases from Russia. Now, Russian oil makes for 21% of Indian oil imports, up from less than 1% before the war. India is buying discounted Russian oil to curb inflation and this trade is no longer denominated in dollars. Along with closer Russia-China ties, India’s imports of Russian oil dent the dominance of the dollar. So are moves by NATO member Turkey to buy discounted Russian oil. If such trends continue, the days of the US dollar may be numbered.

The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.27% , which measures the U.S. currency’s strength against a basket of six other currencies, is up 20.6% in the past 12 months, with the greenback thrashing major counterparts like the yen USDJPY, -1.24% and pound GBPUSD, +0.46% in the process, while wreaking havoc all over the world.

This comes at a time when all three major stock indexes DJIA, +2.18% SPX, +3.09% COMP, +11.15% are nursing double-digit percentage losses this year, global government bonds have been stuck in one of their greatest bear markets ever, and even gold has had a choppy year.

To understand why the dollar is outperforming other assets by so much, even as projections point to 100% certainty of a U.S. recession in the next 12 months, it’s useful to take a step back.

First, currencies always trade relative to what’s going on everywhere else in the world and, right now, rapidly rising U.S. interest rates compared with other countries are the major reason the dollar is appreciating. In technical parlance, that’s known as the interest-rate differential, or difference in monetary policy among central banks.



The Federal Reserve is standing resolute in its efforts to bring down inflation with rate increases, especially after September’s hotter-than-expected consumer-price index produced an 8.2% year-over-year headline rate. Meanwhile, Europe— which reported a 9.9% annual inflation rate for September on Wednesday — is facing an energy crisis that, according to the International Monetary Fund, puts the European Central Bank on a shallower path for interest rates. And in Asia, still-low inflation in Japan and China has enabled central banks there to buck the global tightening trend.



Around the world, this interest-rate differential is weakening a swath of currencies against the dollar.



Officials in one country, Japan, are so alarmed by the depreciation of their currency against the dollar that they reportedly intervened to prop up the yen, which tumbled to as low as 151.95 to the dollar on Friday. Already, there’s been broader debate about whether a multicountry intervention along the lines of the 1985 Plaza Accord needs to take place, but analysts doubt it. One big reason is that a strong dollar helps to hold down inflation domestically, by reducing the cost of imports, and is thus helping the Fed do its job to some extent.

Source: Haver Analytics, IMF staff calculations. Data as of Oct. 4, 2022.

“The struggle right now is the speed with which this dollar strength has happened, where it can become intense and problematic,” said Tom Nakamura, a portfolio manager and currency strategist at AGF Investments in Toronto, which managed C$38.4 billion ($28.2 billion) as of September.

“Such a strong move can trigger a liquidity or credit crisis as companies in other countries try to meet their dollar-denominated obligations. I don’t believe that it’s come to that point yet. But speed is something that is important, whether it’s in the foreign-exchange market or interest rates, because there’s an adjustment process. The faster it happens, the less likely economies around the world can adjust to it and absorb it smoothly,” he said.

DXY explained

There’s a number of ways to judge the dollar’s performance and one of the most common is by using the ICE U.S. Dollar Index, which is calculated about every 15 seconds from a feed of spot prices on different currencies. Six currencies — the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, Swedish krona and Swiss franc — are weighted against the dollar to come up with a calculation of how the U.S. currency is performing.

The index has rallied 16.5% in 2022 and, as of Friday, was trading just 2% below a more-than-two-decade high set in late September, according to FactSet.



Interestingly, Brent crude is the only asset this year that’s managed to outperform the U.S. Dollar Index, according to figures provided on Monday by the BlackRock Investment Institute, the research arm of the world’s largest money manager.

Wrecking Ball

You may have recently heard the dollar described as a wrecking ball and it’s easy to see why. For one thing, foreign governments and private corporations have trillions in dollar-denominated debt that they’re struggling to pay back. For another, U.S. multinationals which do business in multiple countries are seeing their profits and sales erode.



Based on one reported estimate from Credit Suisse Group AG, every 8% to 10% jump in the dollar leads to, on average, a roughly 1% hit to U.S. companies’ profits.

American corporations have been lamenting the greenback’s rise since at least June and this past week brought more indications of how much the strong dollar is taking a toll.



Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +1.08% said it is seeing pressure from the U.S. currency and cut its sales forecast for the year, even though it reported third-quarter earnings that beat estimates. Streaming giant Netflix NFLX, +8.75% linked the dollar’s strength to a weaker fourth-quarter outlook, and Procter & Gamble PG, +2.53% blamed the greenback and rising inflation for fiscal-year earnings that will likely be at the low end of the company’s own forecasts.



James Solloway, chief market strategist at SEI, which oversees about $1.3 trillion in assets, said he wouldn’t be surprised to see a temporary reversal in the dollar’s trend. Meanwhile, a team at JPMorgan Chase & Co. said that with investors fleeing almost every asset class this year and cash on the sidelines reaching a 10-year high, “we stay long the dollar as a hedge to a hawkish Fed in the near-term.”

Stock portfolios take a hit



Though it’s not always the case, analysts say the strong dollar has clearly exacerbated the headwinds facing the U.S. stock market this year.



It’s a “clear negative” for the S&P 500, with industrials, materials, consumer staples and technology being the most sensitive to a stronger U.S. currency, according to a report by RBC Capital Markets. By contrast, stocks in sectors like financials, utilities and real-estate investment trusts should be more insulated, it said.

Today’s strong dollar is benefiting American travelers when it comes to booking hotel stays and paying for food plus fun excursions in Europe, the U.K., Japan and just about everywhere else.

Some of the cheapest places to travel on the U.S. dollar include Costa Rica, Vietnam and Romania — although anywhere outside the 50 states will do. Some well-heeled Americans are even going further by splurging on European homes, where a single purchase can end up being tens of thousands of dollars cheaper than it was earlier this year.



“The concept of dollar strength can be good in different situations,” Nakamura of AGF Investments said via phone on Wednesday. “It could lessen inflation pressures that would have been stronger otherwise domestically. Foreign exporters can benefit from weaker currencies relative to the dollar, which means that Americans can enjoy cheaper imported goods. For the average American, they can also benefit from a dollar that stretches further if they travel abroad.”

bc8d40e5-a998-4ecf-80f2-4917e929a3f4,"For the British elite in the wake of the Battle of the Somme in 1916, the realisation that the future of the war effort, and with it the empire, hinged on American money came as an unholy shock. In France in the 1920s, American tourists were both loved and hated for their purchasing power. Trotsky mocked the way Europe’s old elite humbled themselves before midwestern bankers such as Charles Dawes, who brokered the reparations settlement with Germany of 1924. Things were not helped by America’s aggressive deflations, first in 1920 and again in 1929, which tipped the world into recession, and by the ludicrously dysfunctional American policy mix.

Full-blown isolationism would at least have been consistent. Instead, while the American government refused to muddy its hands with the difficult business of reparations, Wall Street lent to European governments and businesses on a vast scale. Meanwhile, Congress imposed rigorous protectionism, making it impossible to service those debts. By 1933, not just Hitler’s regime but the governments of Britain and France had defaulted on their debts to the US.

Global monetary corset

When it came to devising a new currency system for the world after the Second World War, John Maynard Keynes was determined to avoid dollar hegemony. To tame America’s capricious policy, he proposed a system that would subject everyone to the same pressure to adjust domestic policy to international economic constraints.

It is an idea that has repeatedly resurfaced, most significantly in 2009, in Chinese demands for a new currency system to be based on a synthetic global currency, presumably managed by the IMF or another global body. But the idea never stood a chance. Even under the gold standard, in the pomp of its power after 1945, Washington was not going to accept its subordination to a global monetary corset.

Instead, from the 1950s onwards, the gold reserves of Fort Knox were used to anchor the dollar and the rest of the world’s currencies that were pegged to the US currency. This made the US currency as good as gold – provoking protests from the French about exorbitant privilege. It was a highly unstable arrangement. How could the Fed, a national central bank, which had a commitment to national stability, ensure enough liquidity for a global system?

As Belgian economist Robert Triffin pointed out in 1960, if the Fed acted to correct excess demand in the US, it risked choking off the world economy. Once again, the call went up: world stability depended on a universal currency. In the 1960s the IMF created a synthetic global currency, the SDR, but like Esperanto it never caught on. Instead, the system was held together with swap lines that allowed the Fed to provide dollars to fellow central banks in addition to other interventions, such as bans on open trading in gold.

The US dollar is involved in 85 per cent of all foreign currency transactions. AP

Then in 1971, facing even larger deficits than in the 1960s, Richard Nixon, the president, simply abandoned the dollar peg. Global currencies gyrated wildly. But as the White House tapes recorded, Nixon said he “didn’t give a s*** about the lira”. The dollar plunged, the price of dollar-denominated commodities like oil surged. The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) considered repricing oil in another currency. But the shift never happened. No one else wanted to be the global anchor, certainly not the Germans, whose Deutsche mark was the obvious alternative. The government didn’t want to jeopardise Germany’s status as a champion exporter.

The ‘Volcker Shock’

In 1979 Paul Volcker, chairman of the Fed, finally did the unthinkable. To end the inflation that had troubled the US (and world) economy since the late 1960s, he tightened monetary policy, driving interest rates up and unleashing the economic crisis that many had long feared. The US economy slumped and dollar debtors around the world went into crisis. The US had to bail out its own over-extended banks.

Yet what emerged from the “Volcker Shock” was a new dollar system based on floating exchange rates, the further empowerment of Wall Street and the final defeat of organised labour. Budget constraints on the US were removed again, and from the 1980s it made full use of this freedom, borrowing on a huge scale from Japan and then from China.

By the early 2000s analysts were warning of a dollar crisis ahead. Beijing would surely exercise the whip hand its ownership of trillions of dollars of US Treasury securities gave it. Enraged by NATO’s offer of membership to Ukraine and Georgia, in 2008 Vladimir Putin suggested a concerted Sino-Russian raid on the dollar. This would entail dumping their holdings of Treasuries so as to deliberately crash the market. The Russians sold out. The Chinese did not.

The crisis that year was one internal to the dollar system – the meltdown of bank balance sheets. But rather than plunging in 2008, the dollar rose. From Europe to East Asia, banks around the world were pleading for dollar liquidity. The Fed obliged, dishing out dollars on an epic scale. The same thing happened in 2020: faced with the COVID crisis, the Fed flushed the entire global financial system with the dollar. As ever, instead of overturning dollar hegemony a crisis reinforced the central role of the American currency.

The pattern repeated in 2022. In response to Putin’s invasion of Ukraine the US and Europe imposed sanctions on Russia. In an unprecedented move they violated their commitment to honour central bank claims in favour of the Russian central bank. But after some feverish talk about alternatives to the dollar, what has happened? Instead of selling dollars and fleeing into any other currency, global demand for dollars is stronger than ever.

The secret ingredient

How does an inherently unstable system, whose emergence from 1916 was resisted and whose end has been repeatedly foretold, endure every crisis? What is the secret ingredient that holds the dollar system together?

The significance of Money and Empire, the new book by the economist Perry Mehrling, is that he takes us to the heart of this question. Like Mehrling’s previous books, Money and Empire uses the biography of a leading economist as a device for making a far more general argument. In this case, Mehrling’s medium is Charles P. Kindleberger.

Kindleberger’s career began and took off in the years of the Great Depression, the Second World War and the Marshall Plan. Disillusioned with Washington politics and blacklisted on account of his association with American leftists by McCarthy’s witch hunts, Kindleberger made his career in the prestigious economics department of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Kindleberger is best known for his argument that every successful phase in the world financial system has depended on the presence of a willing hegemon. The Bank of England played this role during Pax Britannica in the 19th century, as has the Fed in recent decades. The disaster of the interwar period, which Kindleberger chronicled in The World in Depression: 1929-1939 (1973), was partly down to the fact that there was no equivalent hegemonic central bank.

It is a compelling theory. But, as Mehrling shows, talk of hegemony is easily misunderstood. Hegemony suggests the authority of governments and states. And central banks, as we know them today, are national state institutions.

But as their history illustrates, the state is not a given thing. It is made historically and through interactions with interests at large. And the boundaries of the state are porous. Private interests intermingle with state power. The Bank of England may have been founded in 1694 but it was not nationalised until 1946. The United States did not have a central bank at all until 1913. Its financial system was regionalised. New York was umbilically connected to the City of London. The regional Fed branches in the United States are to this day stacked with business executives from the districts they represent. Only the Fed board in Washington DC is a truly public institution.

Kindleberger was trained in the 1920s by a generation of American monetary economists who saw themselves as simultaneously helping to engineer a nationally integrated US financial system (centred on the Fed) and a global financial system (centred on the dollar). The First World War both created the US national financial system and began to remake the international system around the US. As the centre of finance shifted from London to Wall Street, the dollar emerged, according to Kindleberger, not so much as a national currency foreign to the rest of the world – in which they nevertheless borrowed, lent and transacted – but as the native currency of the 20th-century global financial system. In this sense the dollar was truly a successor to gold – the common denominator of the pre-1914 London-based regime.

As Mehrling argues, Kindleberger is best thought of less as an international economist than as a cosmopolitan economic thinker. To describe the world economy and its currency system as international implies that its building blocks are national economies. For Kindleberger, what counted was the mesh of private financial transactions running from commercial centre to commercial centre, across national boundaries and in whatever currency happened to be most convenient and offer attractive margins.

Kindleberger was at odds with both the monetarist and Keynesian spirit of the post-1945 period. Despite their differences, over how best to control inflation and manage unemployment, both main schools of macroeconomics focused on the stabilisation of the national economy, while international connections were of secondary import. The world economy appeared as a series of national islands rather than what Hyun Song Shin, a senior economist at the Bank for International Settlements, would later call the interlocking matrix of private balance sheets.

No real alternative

For much of his working life Kindleberger was an economist at odds with his times. His career spanned the heyday of the national economy between the 1930s and the 1980s, whereas his conception of the economy was better suited to the world of globalisation before 1914 and the second phase of globalisation from the 1970s.

This tension was evident in Kindleberger’s confident insistence that far from being doomed by America’s budget deficit and its trade imbalance, the Bretton Woods international monetary system could be saved. What the US authorities needed to do was not to impose national restrictions on capital flows. On the contrary, the key was to trust to the logic of the US-centred financial system. Some money might flow out in the short-term, but it would come back and the safest way to ensure that was to not prevent its exit. After all, where was large-scale global money to go? Then as now, there was no real alternative to the dollar.

For Kindleberger, Nixon’s freeing of the dollar from gold, the deliberate destruction of an international monetary system for the sake of national economic and political priorities, was the disastrous denouement of the national economic point of view. But his own alarm also proved to be overdone.

Rather than tearing the world economy apart, the end of Bretton Woods would confirm Kindleberger’s basic point: the resilience of the dollar system lies not in the robust health of the US national economy or its national politics, but in the strength of a global financial network that is woven in dollars, and the willingness of the Fed to support that network as a lender of last resort.

This remains the central insight today. When we evaluate the world economy and conclude that the dollar’s role in global finance is disproportionate to its share of global GDP, that America’s trade deficit is unsustainable, that congressional politics is a mess and presidential leadership is dangerously erratic, we are conflating two fundamentally incommensurate visions of the world economy: the one cosmopolitan, the other national or inter-national.

The resilience of the dollar is pre-eminently the effect of a cosmopolitan power structure. And as Mehrling writes, “while the United States may well have become unable to lead”, the global dollar system not only survives but expands, as private actors find ways through derivatives trades to insulate themselves against national shocks and the network of central banks centred on the Fed finds ever new instruments “to put a floor underneath the muddle”.

With more than one-third of Gen Zers turning to TikTok for financial advice, avoiding tips that seem too good to be true is crucial. Following bad money advice can not only cost you financially -- in some cases it could land you in legal trouble.

We spoke to an attorney and a credit counselor who've seen firsthand what can happen when people listen to bad money advice on TikTok. Here are a few TikTok money tips that can land you in financial and legal trouble.

Anyone can claim to be an 'expert' on TikTok

Michelle Creeden and David A. Gelinas work for the National Legal Center, where they help people dealing with credit and debt issues. Creeden is an attorney licensed to practice law in New Hampshire and is experienced in consumer and debtor rights. Gelinas has over 20 years of experience in credit counseling, not-for-profit debt management and debt resolution.

Both have helped clients who have had the misfortune to follow the wrong financial advice on TikTok.

""There are plenty of people who are going to teach you things that they don't fully understand,"" Creeden said. ""I see a lot of clients that will bring me or send me links … and it really is just terrible advice from someone who might have known a little bit of information -- 'just enough to be dangerous' is how I refer to it.""

According to Gelinas, FinTokers tend to give a lot of general information. Such advice doesn't consider the level of risk for the viewer or how dire their financial situation may be. It also can skip some important specifics.

""It can easily get someone in trouble,"" he said.

For instance, one of Creeden's clients saw TikToks about the snowball debt repayment method. It's a popular strategy for getting rid of credit card debt that suggests paying off the cards with the lowest balances first to keep yourself motivated.

Here's just one example of a TikTok from @thecreditbrothers about the snowball method:

@thecreditbrothers The Easiest Way To Pay Off Your Credit Card Debt: The Debt Snowball Method ♬ original sound - Credit Brothers

The creator hasn't said anything wrong, and this debt repayment strategy does work for many people. However, @thecreditbrothers, like many others on FinTok, fail to mention that you still need to continue paying all your other debts too.

""Not everybody realizes that,"" Creeden said. ""If you're following a piece of information or advice without really understanding the whole scheme, it can really cause problems. So I had [a client] that decided to follow the advice of paying the smallest balance first. And so she stopped paying her taxes and her student loans.""

This caused immediate problems. As a result, the person who was simply trying out the snowball method had to seek Creeden's services.

The same creator, @thecreditbrothers, has offered another piece of advice that's common on the platform about dealing with debt:

Another one of Creeden's clients decided to try it.

""They didn't have any plan on how to deal with the debt or how to minimize the risk,"" Creeden said. ""Then they came to us after they'd been sued on multiple debts. And they just had no plan. Nothing.""

Creeden's client didn't think a plan was necessary. They were just following credit advice on TikTok that seemed simple enough. However, according to Creeden, the advice was given without any explanation of the risks and resulted in garnishment that Creeden had to help fight.

Legal advice on TikTok is particularly dangerous

Things can get even more dangerous when TikTokers provide advice that veers into legal territory.

For example, this TikTok from @ksmithcredit talks about the time frame you have to respond to a collection lawsuit:

However, response windows vary by state, and the risks mentioned don't apply in all states. For instance, wages are not garnished for collection cases in Texas, South Carolina and a few other states.

""Scaring people into filing answers in all situations makes no sense and can cost money,"" Creeden said. ""Filing fees can be large -- $400 in some courts.""

This TikTok from @thedisputeher suggests you remove your valid addresses from your Experian credit report:

The idea is that the credit bureau will also remove the negative accounts associated with those addresses. However, credit bureaus won't delete the information that's accurate. Plus, even if this ""hack"" works, you risk losing the positive information tied to the removed addresses too. So, taking this advice could still end up hurting your credit score.

TikTok creator @epiccreditscore offers legal advice in all states, despite states having different laws.

In this TikTok, the creator suggests using the ""statute of limitations"" defense (referring to the time period a company has to take legal action against you) if a collections agency sues you. This general legal tactic is common advice on TikTok, but it's also misleading.

""It's true that [statute of limitations] is an important aspect,"" Gelinas said. ""[But] that is not always that simple."" According to him, the best practice is for an in-state attorney to review the case, since it can often be highly complicated.

""I don't advise people outside of the area that I'm capable of practicing in,"" Creeden said. ""When people who are not attorneys are doing it in all the states, they are more likely to give the wrong information.""

The consequences, she said, can be severe and can impact your wages and credit.

How to find helpful TikTok money advice

Does this mean you should never come to TikTok and social media for financial advice? Not necessarily.

Both Creeden and Gelinas agree that there are benefits to browsing money tips on FinTok. Creeden acknowledges enjoying using TikTok and finds some FinTokers incredibly positive and helpful: @journeycreditacceptance, for instance, is someone she follows and appreciates.

Plus, before the days of financial influencers, money advice wasn't as accessible.

""My generation didn't know much about credit or debt or… how to invest,"" Creeden said. ""You know, those aren't things that we discussed at all in school.""

Today, social media is changing that. Young people can get familiar with these topics simply by scrolling on TikTok. They can learn important financial terms and gain an understanding of money basics. All they need to do to keep their wallets safe is to stay vigilant.

There's no official entity monitoring TikTok to check whether creators offer valid financial advice. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau isn't going to come after FinTokers who offer inaccurate information. It's up to you to choose what advice to trust.

Gelinas recommends being ""very diligent… and very discerning."" If you find money advice on TikTok you want to try, verify it against multiple sources. Dig in to research the topic in full before taking any steps. It's also a good idea to take a closer look at the creator. Are they a recognized expert on the matter? What credentials do they have to prove it?

Remember that personal finance is also always personal. What works for others might not apply in your situation, especially if you're experiencing financial trouble. When you're in a crisis, it's best to reach out to a professional for help. You wouldn't (or at least shouldn't) go to TikTok for medical advice on a serious health issue. It's smart to treat your financial health the same way."
ca012422-8fe0-4eaa-b889-ab229c0eea0d,"A young man who saved more than $200,000 by the age of 26 has offered the 10 simple money rules he swears by.

Charlie Ehlers, a stock investor from Perth, outlined the biggest money mistakes young people make - including purchasing things with “buy now, pay later” services, splashing out on designer labels and buying a house.

“Here are some money rules I follow as someone in my 20s who’s been investing for almost 10 years now,” Charlie said in his TikTok video.

The young man was able to save more than $200,000 after he set up three financial goals for himself - including learning about investing, spending money smarter, and working full-time while studying.

One of the first rules he points out is “never count your chickens before they hatch”.

“If you want to buy something and you can’t quite afford it yet, but you’re like, ‘It’s okay, I get paid on Friday’. No, you haven’t earned that thing yet, wait,” Charlie said.

“Wait until you have the money and then buy the thing.”

He urged everyone to avoid using “buy now, pay later” schemes, interest-free payment options for shoppers to split the total purchase amount into four biweekly payments.

“They are f****** atrocities,” he said.

“If you use these, I’m giving you one of these (slap). You don’t need them, you shouldn’t need them.”

Targeting broke people

Charlie says shoppers should never waste their money on designer clothing brands and labels.

“These brands have mastered your psychology and they specifically target broke people who want to look rich,” he said.

“And I don’t judge, so if that‘s what you wanna be then, like, that’s fine by me.

“Just letting you know there are brands that are just as good where you’re not paying for the brand name.”

Charlie suggests not buying a home.

“Unless you’ve sat down and gone through all the numbers of what it cost to run and own a home, and the opportunity cost, you’re not allowed to comment on that point,” he said.

“I would personally buy a home if I could turn it into a cash flowing asset, which most don’t.

“That’s because a home purchase is usually a lifestyle choice, it’s an emotional decision.”

Charlie says he will buy a home at a “very specific place for a very specific reason” once he starts a family.

“But to build wealth, buying a home to live in is not the answer,” he insisted.

“Unless you do it with the intention of making it a cash flowing asset.”

‘Don’t go to uni’

Making a “controversial” statement, Charlie suggests against tackling a university degree.

“Don’t go to uni unless you’re keen on a profession,” he said.

“Too many people go into debt to get a degree that they don’t use.

“If you’re getting a degree, do it because you want to be in that profession.”

Charlie offered the 10 simple money rules he swears by. Credit: Charlie Ehlers

For social drinkers, Charlie suggests having “pre-drinks” before you head out so you’re not blowing all your money at bars.

“I drink out too, but if you’re someone who will go and spend like $150 to $200 on a night out on drinks, but then you complain about fuel prices, rent prices and interest rates, you’re idiotic,” he said.

“Pre-drink and spend like $20, $30 or $50 out.”

Positive cash flow

Surprisingly, he recommends considering getting your car financed.

“I’m giving it a thumbs up. Hear me out,” he said.

“I haven’t financed my car but in the future I think I will. For every dollar you spend on a car in cash - that’s every dollar that is depreciating in value over time.

“But if that same money was invested earning like 10 per cent per annum, but the car finances only costing you five per cent, you’re in a positive cash flow situation by having the car.”

However, he warns there’s a catch.

“You’ve got to be able to afford the car and invest. No good just financing a car that you can’t afford,” he said.

And on popular meal-delivery services, Charlie explains how you should use them only sparingly.

“(The services are) pretty good,” he said.

“But don’t let me catch you complaining about fuel crisis and interest rates when you’re getting Uber Eats four times a week.”

Invest in good bedding

The money-wise lad also suggests to always “invest in good bedding”.

“Like, seriously, you spend one third of your life in bed, for some people it’s more. Your sleep has the biggest impact on your health so buy good bedding,” Charlie explained.

Finally, he said to always round up the dollar when transferring money to friends.

“If you go out and your friend gets the bill and you got to transfer them, don’t transfer them like $25.25 or some s***,” he said.

“Round it up, I wouldn’t want to see that s*** in my bank account, neither do they.

“They took on the risk of you not paying them back so they should get rewarded for that.”"

The country's currency surged within hours Friday in New York, with the rapid swing fueling speculation that Japanese authorities intervened for the second time.

But market participants say such efforts will only help slow the pace of the yen's slide and do little to reverse its weakening trend as long as a gap between U.S. and Japanese interest rates is expected to widen."
c4da4d66-ecc0-4006-9bb0-3c1953c19bb1,"(Bloomberg) -- When Covid sent the UK economy into lockdown in 2020, the government jumped in to help the property market by cutting a tax on purchases. The temporary measure triggered a kind of mania among buyers, who responded by bidding up average prices by £31,000 ($35,000) — more than double the maximum tax saving.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The frenzy echoed the buildup to the house price crash that started at the end of the 1980s, when the government announced it would cut a tax relief for couples buying property, leading to a surge in demand. The slump that followed was brutal, with the market taking almost nine years to return to its previous high.

The housing market now faces similar challenges, according to Simon French, chief economist at investment bank Panmure Gordon, who forecasts a 14% fall in house prices over the next three years. That would take values back to 2013 levels in real terms. Bloomberg Economics expects values to drop about 10% next year.

It’s not just in the UK that property markets are flashing signals of downturns from 30 years ago.

The big losers then — which included Australia, Canada and Sweden — all saw home prices reach records in recent years as cheap credit made home ownership possible even as values soared. But now, they’re facing a reckoning as central banks battle to cool inflation.

That means interest rates are rising rapidly, bringing to a close the era of easy money that’s defined the years since the 2008 global financial crisis. There are also implications for household wealth and economic growth at a time when recession risks already hang over many countries.

“There are parallels between now and then,” said Manoj Pradhan, founder of research firm Talking Heads Macroeconomics and a former Morgan Stanley economist. But soaring inflation means “things could be significantly worse. The overall increase in and level of debt is quite high compared with that time. The sensitivity to interest rate rises is huge.”

Story continues

Here’s a look at some of the key developments then and now in countries where property is at risk, or already in a downswing.

Canada

Drive from Toronto’s main airport toward downturn and you pass row upon row of apartment blocks developed during the easy money era.

That has echoes of the 1980s boom in the city, driven by speculation on condos, which ended suddenly, leaving prices plunging. Then, as now, inflation was on the march, and interest rates had to move sharply higher to combat it. In 1990, mortgage rates topped 13% and the Toronto housing market tumbled into a deep freeze for years. Sales plummeted, and prices didn’t hit bottom until 1996 after losing more than a quarter of their value.

Today, the economy is in better shape. But after a nearly unbroken 25-year period of price increases, Toronto looks shaky again. Affordability is as bad as it was during the late 1980s bubble, according to National Bank of Canada. Royal Bank of Canada’s economics department calls it a “historic correction,” and says national home resale volumes may fall more than they did in the early 1990s, peak-to-trough.

The most frenzied speculation this time around took place in the suburbs and outlying cities near Toronto to which people flocked when Covid hit, searching for more space.

There, the correction has arrived swiftly. In the cities of Kitchener and Waterloo, Ontario, about a 90-minute drive west, the benchmark price is down 16% in six months. In Oakville and Milton, two closer suburbs that are home to many finance professionals, they’ve dropped 14%.

But prices are still significantly higher than they were before the pandemic, so there could be more declines to come.

China

Images of unfinished housing blocks symbolize the bleak state of Chinese real estate, where buyers are paying for homes that they can’t occupy. That led to a mortgage boycott this year, with homebuyers threatening to halt making payments.

About 2 million unfinished homes presold by developers have halted construction, according to estimates from S&P Global Ratings. That’s reminiscent of a property bust 30 years ago on Hainan Island, the country’s tropical resort island dubbed “China’s Hawaii.”

Property developers emerged there in the 1980s after it became one of the first areas of China to liberalize its economy, drawing migrants seeking work. That in turn boosted demand for housing, minting the country’s first batch of property entrepreneurs including Soho China Ltd.’s founder Pan Shiyi.

Home prices more than tripled between 1989 and 1992, but the boom imploded the following year after Beijing tightened monetary policy and lending into the sector. More than 600 buildings were left abandoned, local media reported at the time.

China has pursued similar policies to contain its boom over the last three years. Financing has been squeezed and the government asked banks to slow the pace of mortgage lending. That triggered a wave of defaults and left millions of square feet of unfinished buildings.

In 1999, the State Council stepped in to help resolve unfinished projects, including turning part of them into subsidized housing for low-income workers. The government has turned again to that playbook, offering 200 billion yuan ($28 billion) in special loans to ensure stalled housing projects are delivered.

According to George Magnus, a research associate at Oxford University’s China Centre, the underlying fundamentals look “pretty glum for the foreseeable future.”

“We may get a property bust,” he said. “China has joined up with the rest of the world in experiencing property problems.”

While many economists say the crippling housing downturn won’t get much worse and that the stimulus will kick in this year or next, few are calling for a sharp rebound. But the policy moves, along with a gradual easing of Covid restrictions, may help the market find a floor.

Australia

Australia saw a big run up in the home prices during the pandemic, but the central bank has jacked up its benchmark interest rate by 250 basis points in a matter of months, and the market has gone into reverse.

Values are falling faster than they were during the early 1980s and the early 1990s recessions, according to Tim Lawless, research director at CoreLogic.

The firm’s combined capitals index, which includes home values in Australia's eight capital cities, dropped 5.5% in the past five months. Over the same timeframe in the 1990s downturn, housing values were down 2.9%. It’s even worse in Sydney, where prices have fallen for eight consecutive months and are now 9% off the peak.

“In 1994, we had the most rapid increase in interest rates,” said Paul Cameron, senior economist at real estate firm PropTrack. “We saw a kind of two downturns in the property market — one after the 1989 run-up in prices and the other after the increase in interest rates. At the moment, we have got both those scenarios.”

One concern in Australia, and echoed in other economies too, is stretched household finances. The debt-to-income ratio is at 187%, compared with about 70% during the 1990s.

“Arguably households are much more sensitive to the cost of debt now than what they were back in those previous recessions,” Lawless said, though he stressed the economy remains strong, as does employment.

Sweden

There are similar dynamics at play in Sweden. Property continued to boom through the pandemic, but that’s changed after interest rates jumped from zero to 1.75% this year.

House prices are falling — at a record pace based on some measures — and highly-leveraged commercial property companies are coming under pressure from rising rates, which has parallels to the 1990s financial crisis.

Back then, rising rates popped a commercial real-estate bubble fueled by credit deregulation. The bust, which reverberated across the financial sector, thrust Sweden into a crisis that would see public debt and unemployment soar, and force the government to take control of distressed private banks.

While policy makers are concerned, there are factors that could prevent events now from spiraling out of control in the same fashion. Leverage among commercial property owners is far below levels at the beginning of the 1990s, which followed a period of rampant credit expansion.

But at the same time, household borrowing is a massive risk, with debt-to-income ratios around 200%, up from about 150% before the global financial crisis.

UK

Back in the UK, Prime Minister Liz Truss’s government has again cut the rate of stamp duty to bolster the market.

That was announced as part of a big tax giveaway (some of which was subsequently cancelled) that hurled UK markets into turmoil. Bond yields jumped, contributing to soaring mortgage interest rates, and a number of lenders even pulled home loan products off the market.

That backdrop will make it hard to encourage demand, which property portal Zoopla says has fallen 20% since the so-called mini-budget, leaving it at its weakest since the pandemic started.

“The steep repricing of mortgages — with rates unseen for more than a decade and a sharp deterioration of affordability” may “shock buyers and freeze housing activity until rates normalize at least a bit and buyers readjust their expectations,” said Iwona Hovenko, Bloomberg Intelligence European housing analyst.

Broker Hamptons International warned before the stamp duty cut that home prices are likely to decline if the Bank of England’s base rate exceeds 2.5%. It’s already at 2.25%, and expected to rise to at least 3% early next month. The average 5-year fixed rate mortgage reached a 14-year-high this month.

“Rather than a credit crunch, the current shock looks more like the one that landed in the early 1990s when interest rates spiked, house prices slumped and the recovery was slow,” said Niraj Shah, an economist at Bloomberg Economics.

The last two housing slumps began in London before spreading out from there, according to Danny Dorling, professor of human geography at the University of Oxford, who’s researched the UK crash in the 1990s.

And the capital is showing some signs of trouble now. Prices are more than £4,000 below their February peak, researcher Acadata Ltd. says, and values are falling in 10 of the city’s 33 boroughs.

“Property is another asset that will suffer globally from the harm inflicted by the Fed and other central banks,” said Hugh Hendry, a real estate investor and former hedge fund manager. “Stressed investors will dump, prices will swoon.”

d1f1fa82-2845-4528-8b6e-f9e0adb09801,"Demand from homebuyers has fallen below 2019 levels for the first time since the Covid housing market shutdown as rocketing mortgage rates hammer affordability.

Buyer demand fell to just 74pc of the five-year average on October 16, according to property website Zoopla, which measured searches and inquiries.

This was a drop of 37pc compared to the same day last year and three percentage points below the indexed level at the same time in 2019.

Buyer interest has now fallen below the 2019 level for three consecutive days – a threshold that had not been crossed since the first Covid lockdown, when moving house was effectively banned.

The drop is a direct result of soaring mortgage rates, which have forced hundreds of thousands of buyers to slash their budgets or give up hopes of moving altogether."

The average price tag on a UK house hit a new record high of £371,158 in October despite the mortgage rate rises that followed the mini-budget.

The average asking price on a home in the UK increased by £3,398 month-on-month, according to Rightmove, which said shortages of property for sale are continuing to underpin prices.

The property website said that surging interest rates are causing some prospective homebuyers to delay their decision.

Demand for buying new homes has fallen by 15% in the last two weeks, in the wake of the mini-budget that rocked the UK economy.

About 1,000 mortgage deals were removed from sale by lenders last month, after former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng’s mini-budget on 23 September spooked financial markets and prompted expectations of far higher interest rates.

While buyer demand was still 20% higher than in the same period in 2019, it had fallen 15% compared to the same two weeks in 2021.

Tim Bannister Rightmove’s director of property science said: “Some aspiring first-time buyers will have had their plans dashed by the sudden nature of the mortgage rate rises, and now face a difficult situation with rents also rising, and a shortage of available homes to rent.

“Buyer demand was already starting to soften and higher interest rates were anticipated but they’ve been brought forward sharply due to market uncertainties.”

He added: “It’s understandable that some new movers who have the option to wait may want a clearer view than they’re getting right now before they proceed with a major purchase such as a home.

“With uncertainty over where mortgage interest rates will go, those who can still afford to proceed may decide that waiting too long could come at an even higher cost than taking action to move now, especially if the level of demand continues to outstrip supply and supports prices.”

Rightmove reported a rush of buyers trying to complete sales before mortgage offers fixed at prior lower repayment rates expired. Prices were reduced on 23% of homes on sale, compared with 21% last month.

The property website said asking prices were likely to drop in November and December, in line with normal seasonal price changes, and that there were “more economic events to play out” before forecasting the market in 2023.

Matt Powell, a branch manager at Royston and Lund estate agents in Nottingham said: “The long-term repercussions of the mini-budget announcement are probably still too early to see in real time, although they had a dramatic and almost immediate impact on mortgage interest rates.

“Those with transactions under way are keen to see them through and complete their deal quickly with the rates already secured.

“Some buyers are actively having to re-evaluate their borrowing options quickly and while we haven’t seen the appetite to buy dwindle too much, some buyers’ ability to proceed has been thrown into question.

“That being said, demand is still outstripping supply for the time-being, so as long as properties are priced correctly, activity levels are still strong.”

Payments made during the outage were being restored on Thursday as the RBA cleared the backlog on the fast settlement service.

Real-time peer-to-peer payments via most banking websites and apps were operating again on Thursday as backlogs were processed.

The central bank expressed contrition in a statement on Thursday afternoon.

“We sincerely apologise to industry participants and customers for the inconvenience and disruption caused,” RBA deputy governor Michele Bullock said.

“It was disappointing that this occurred, and we recognise the impact this would have on people relying on the payments system. I want to assure people that the bank takes the stability of the payments infrastructure very seriously and will double its effort to ensure this does not happen again.”

The outage stopped payments being made by bank customers via Osko, which uses the new payments platform (NPP) to send money in the retail market in real time. Banks took heat from customers, who were not sure that payments had gone through.

NPP Australia, which manages the real-time infrastructure, said the Osko system was fully operational once the RBA issue was revolved.

Questions on real-time payments

Payments experts said the outage raised questions about the rollout of real-time payments, which are set to replace the legacy direct entry system, while criticising the RBA for the delay in restoring the system.

Said Brad Kelly, managing director of Payment Services, a consulting firm: “The time it has taken to get it back up is too long.”

It is understood business payments were also hit as a 9:30pm “batch” was not fully processed by the BECS system, leaving many payroll operations not completed and employees without their salaries.

The RBA has said FSS was designed “to quickly settle individual transactions, including payments made by consumers and businesses, 24 hours per day and 7 days a week”. But it tweeted at 8:09am on Thursday saying: “The RBA experienced an internal system engineering issue yesterday evening. The issue has been contained. Impacted external services are now operational however there has been some delay to overnight processing of payments.”

RBA staff went into emergency meetings on Wednesday night that continued into Thursday morning, and are believed to be preparing a major incident report, which should provide more detail about how the outage happened. The RBA declined to say when this would be released.

In a statement to the Financial Review, NPP Australia said: “NPP staff, NPP participants and RBA staff worked in accordance with defined procedures through last night into the early hours of this morning to respond to this RBA system issue. This work will continue today across the industry to ensure all payments which were impacted through this incident are fully processed.”

Many consumers have taken to social media to express their frustration that payments that were supposed to be sent in real-time were not received.

“I’m still waiting for funds to land in my other bank after transferring out of Westpac last night. Any timeframe on this?” one customer asked Westpac on its social media channel on Thursday afternoon.

A Westpac staff member monitoring the channel responded: “Hi there, I’m terribly sorry to hear of any concern while awaiting your funds, and we’re certainly here to help guide you in the right direction. To ensure we can best assist, could you please send us a DM with further details on what’s occurred?”

The Reserve Bank has made commercial banks report outages to maintain confidence in the payments system. Banks are now considering how this outage will be included in the next set of outage reports to be provided to the RBA.

These reports, published quarterly, have not included the reasons for outages.

Payments experts said the outage raised questions about the speed of the rollout of real-time payments in Australia, including a new service known as PayTo, which the RBA is supporting to create an alternative to card-based payments over the NPP directly from bank accounts.

Said Mr Kelly: “This casts a shadow over the rollout of PayTo, which has still not done a transaction. In terms of consumer protections and risk, we need to discuss whether NPP is a suitable replacement for debit and credit cards, while the imminent retirement of ‘direct entry’ needs to be questioned because it is the only fallback.”

The last major RBA IT disruption was in August 2018, when it experienced a complete shutdown of all primary and back-up power supplies in one of its data centres. This was caused by the incorrect execution of routine fire control systems testing in the data centre by an external party.

That shutdown hit all the RBA technology systems, including the high-value settlement system used by banks and other approved institutions to settle their payments, which was down for around three hours.

Correction: An earlier version of this story said some Centrelink were impacted by the outage; the RBA confirmed all Centrelink payments went through on Wednesday night."

“Sent money using PayID (Osko) nearly two hours ago and it hasn’t landed in the other bank account yet,” one user commented on DownDetector, which monitors outages on websites.

“Sent money to myself with Osko two hours ago. Has left one account but not gone into the other,” added another.

“My partner has sent me $60 and its just gone? Also my payee list is wiped and I cannot use PayID as an option to pay anyone anymore? What is going on?” lamented a third.

Others slammed the service for the outage and demanded updates on the situation.

“How can all Osko payments just be down? What if important payments need to be made and people get stuck without money? Disgraceful,” a frustrated Twitter user said.

“Would be helpful if you could all provide updates informing people that Osko is down, which appears to be the case. It will probably help prevent further angst for people over the next few hours,” another added.

RBA responds

The Reserve Bank of Australia revealed on Thursday morning it had been impacted by an “internal system engineering issue”.

“The RBA experienced an internal system engineering issue yesterday evening,” a spokesperson told 7NEWS.com.au.

“The issue has been contained. Impacted external services are now operational, however there has been some delay to overnight processing of payments,” they said.

“The RBA experienced an internal system engineering issue yesterday evening,” the bank posted to Twitter.

“The issue has now been contained. Impacted external services are now operational however there has been some delay to overnight processing of payments.”

Big banks, including ANZ, Commonwealth and Westpac, as well as smaller operations copped the fund transfer outage, which left customers unable to make transfers for several hours.

Issues reportedly started about 7pm on Wednesday and the problem was fixed about 3am Thursday.

However, there were still many complaints from affected customers into Thursday afternoon. Some said they were still unable to make transactions, while others complained of incomplete transactions.

Westpac said it was aware of an issue identified by payment platform operators that was affecting all Australian financial institutions.

The issue, as you can see, was affecting the New Payments Platform and Osko payments.

The New Payments Platform, which now isn’t so new, is basically an upgraded banking system for Australia. It launched back in 2018. Its biggest selling point was that it allows for the transfer of money from one person to another in near real-time, using an email address or phone number rather than the traditional BSB or account number process. It was built by the Reserve Bank of Australia in consultation with 13 banks, comprised of the “big four” and some smaller ones.

Many banks built their own superfast payment infrastructure, but other smaller banks utilise the one built by Osko.

Up until now, you haven’t really needed to know how it all worked, let alone who was behind it, you just needed to know your mate could have your $30 within seconds.

723f9869-222c-4447-9438-c0f955eed79c,"PayPal Says Statement That It Would Fine Users for ‘Misinformation’ Was ‘Incorrect Information’

PayPal, the company co-founded by right-wing darling Peter Thiel, was caught in a firestorm of conservative backlash over the weekend for daring to say it would not allow its services to be used to promote misinformation. Now, the company has walked everything back, and further claimed that policy was one big misunderstanding.

On Saturday, several conservative outlets reported that PayPal had updated its Acceptable Use Policy with a notice that starting Nov. 3, the company’s prohibited activities would include “the sending, posting, or publication of any messages, content, or materials” promoting disinformation and hate speech or otherwise causing harm, according to screenshots saved by Mediaite. Those who violated the policy could have been hit with a $US2,500 ($3,471) fine against their PayPal account, according to info detailed in the initial AUP changes.

The company retracted the notice over the weekend, and in a statement to Gizmodo a company spokesperson said:

“An AUP notice for the U.S. recently went out in error that included incorrect information. PayPal is not fining people for misinformation and this language was never intended to be inserted in our policy. We’re sorry for the confusion this has caused.”

Of course, PayPal maintains wide controls over user accounts. PayPal mentions in its user agreement that people may be responsible for damages to PayPal for violating their Acceptable Use Policy, likely through a reputational hit or potentially opening up the company to lawsuits. The current AUP mentions that users cannot use PayPal services to sell drugs or promote ponzi schemes, and the added language would have put misinformation in the same category as promoting illegal drug use.

Conservative Twitter was aflame over PayPal’s initial policy update, with users mostly conflating the supposed $US2,500 ($3,471) fine with any lies they tell on other social media platforms. Major officials like Federal Communications Commission commissioner Brendan Carr called it “Orwelian” and further argued “This is why it is so vital that state and federal legislatures pass laws that prohibit discrimination by tech companies and protect free speech,” hinting at his own agenda against any and all forms of content moderation on regular social media.

Even former PayPal president David Marcus jumped in to call out his old company.

It’s hard for me to openly criticize a company I used to love and gave so much to. But @PayPal’s new AUP goes against everything I believe in. A private company now gets to decide to take your money if you say something they disagree with. Insanity. https://t.co/Gzf8faChUb — David Marcus (@davidmarcus) October 8, 2022

The whole situation, especially conservative’s take on the AUP changes, is incredibly surreal for multiple reasons. PayPal isn’t a social media company by any stretch, and the policy would have attributed to those who actively use PayPal’s services to promote hate speech or disinformation.

The social media companies that conduct content moderation do not attack accounts for content posted outside their own spheres. This past weekend, Kanye West found that his Twitter account had been suspended, but that was for an antisemitic tweet he posted. Instagram had also restricted the rapper’s account for antisemitic content posted separately on Instagram. The AUP terms would have likely kicked in only if Ye was using PayPal to pay for services that were promoting his drivel.

Of course, even though the company has gone backwards on its proposed policy, right-wing circles aren’t ready to let it off the hook. Some particularly ghoulish right-wing folks called it a case of “cancel culture.”

Remember that the only reason PayPal won’t be fining people $2,500 for “misinformation” is because we spoke up, boycotted them and cancelled our accounts.



Do not silently be a player in the game of cancel culture. Fight back. — Lauren Boebert (@laurenboebert) October 9, 2022

A few years ago, PayPal CEO Dan Schulman told The Wall Street Journal they were actively working to end payment services for certain companies, particularly bastions of hate speech and conspiracy chucking like Infowars and the Gab messaging platform. Infowars, headed by the human equivalent of a pot boiling over Alex Jones, sued PayPal over his ban through InfoWars’ parent company Free Speech Systems, but later dropped the lawsuit and the case is still in arbitration.

Schulman said there were “those both on the right and left that help us,” mentioning the Southern Poverty Law Centre who have brought certain issues to their attention, though the CEO added, “We don’t always agree. We have our debates with them.” Conservatives latched on to this idea that the company takes advice from the SPLC, even though that has no basis in what the CEO actually said."

The online finance behemoth has since updated its terms and conditions removing a new clause which threatened users who published misinformation that they could be subject to “liquidated damages of $2,500.00 U.S. dollars per violation”.

The terms and conditions did not offer any information about who would decide what was “misinformation” or what any process for appeal would be.

PayPal reneged on the policy change on October 8 claiming the notice was an “error that included incorrect information”.

But following a massive social media controversy, PayPal may have lost thousands of customers.

In data obtained by Sky News Australia from the global online analytics firm SimilarWeb, visitors to the PayPal 'Close My Account' sections, for both personal and business accounts, spiked 557 per cent in one day.

On October 8, there were more than 44,000 visits to the Close Account sections in one day. The following day there were 52,000.

The web traffic to this section across the two days amounted to 96,000 – a seismic uptick from the entire month of September where visitors to the cancellation page never exceeded 7,000 in a single day.

Social media blew up in reaction to PayPal’s controversial policy change, with regular customers, celebrities and politicians enraged by the update.

Prior to PayPal’s clarification that it itself published misinformation in its updated terms of service, Republican Senator Tim Scott said the move would be an “egregious and illegal overreach”.

“My office will be looking into the validity of PayPal’s new policy and taking any necessary action to stop this type of corporate activism,” Senator Scott Tweeted on Sunday.

American cryptocurrency entrepreneur and former PayPal President David Marcus said the policy “goes against everything I believe in”, describing it as “insanity”.

Replying to Marcus’ tweet, PayPal co-founder and billionaire Elon Musk said: “agreed”, while founding Chief Operating Officer David Sacks told customers to “get your money out of PayPal right now”.

Brendan Carr, the Commissioner of the United States Federal Communications Commission said the policy was “Orwellian”.

Many Twitter users called for PayPal customers to cancel their accounts leading to Google searches for people looking to axe their subscriptions rising by more than 1,300 per cent.

The uproar has also significantly affected PayPal’s share price which has dropped by almost 9 per cent in the past five days on the US stock exchange Nasdaq.

As a result of the massive share price drop, PayPal’s market capitalisation was slashed by more than $6 billion.

PayPal has reportedly changed its cancellation process, forcing customers wishing to close their accounts to call the company’s customer service hotline instead of being able to do so quickly online.

In response to a series of questions from SkyNews.com.au about the mass cancellations, a PayPal spokesperson said: “An Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) notice recently went out in error that included incorrect information. PayPal is not fining people for misinformation and this language was never intended to be inserted in our policy. We’re sorry for the confusion this has caused.”

SkyNews.com.au understands that enforcement of PayPal's Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) is handled differently depending on the country of the user, and that PayPal does not apply damages against AUP violations in Australia like it does in other parts of the world."

Some high-profile Twitter users, including former PayPal PYPL, +0.99% president David Marcus, called out the company, while other Twitter users rallied around online calls to boycott the payments service. Search queries for how to delete a PayPal account rose sharply.

Shares of PayPal lost 7.9% over the course of Monday and Tuesday, underperforming the S&P 500 SPX, +3.09% , which fell 1.4% during those two days, but Jefferies analyst Trevor Williams said he wasn’t sure that the controversy would spark a mass exodus from the PayPal platform.

He noted in a Wednesday report to clients that data from ListenFirst, which does social-media analytics, indicated that only 70,000 accounts tweeted, retweeted, or liked a tweet with the #DeletePayPal hashtag over the span of Saturday to Monday. For context, PayPal Chief Executive Dan Schulman disclosed on the company’s earnings call that PayPal had “nearly 400 million consumer accounts.”

“If action taken by consumers in response to the policy update/retraction is isolated to those that voiced displeasure via social media (or even a multiple of those that did), we would not expect there to be any noticeable impact on net new active accounts,” Jefferies’ Williams wrote.

He acknowledged that the “only lingering risk” for PayPal would be if the controversy “prompts a broader politically motivated boycott, the likelihood of which is impossible to measure.” But the Twitter ire “faded significantly on Monday,” Williams wrote, suggesting that the episode was unlikely to escalate into something bigger.

The backlash comes during a tough year for PayPal, which has seen its shares fall by half over the course of 2022 as the management team reset expectations numerous times. Executives backtracked on rosy pandemic-era projections for medium-term growth and also pulled back on annual targets.

While PayPal shed $8.2 billion in market value over the course of trading Monday and Tuesday, Sentieo research director Nick Mazing highlighted that such a decline is “tiny compared to the market cap loss since the peak.” PayPal was worth more than $360 billion at its July 2021 peak, but it was only worth $104 million as of Friday’s close. The market value dipped to $96 billion by the end of Tuesday’s session.

Despite the recent challenges, Bank of America analyst Jason Kupferberg is feeling upbeat about the company’s prospects, writing that he sees an “attractive risk/reward” setup heading into PayPal’s third-quarter earnings report. He thinks that the company could realize upside to revenue from other valued-added services, stemming from rising interest rates, and he also flagged the potential for a positive surprise on margins as PayPal has been focused on cost cuts.

He noted in his Wednesday report that PayPal is his “top pick.”"

Last month, the Fed raised its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage points for the third straight time. Since then, policymakers have voiced an urgent need to defeat inflation, even if aggressive interest rate increases mean higher unemployment and slower economic activity.

Fed futures are 90 per cent priced for another 0.75 percentage point lift in November, taking the benchmark to a range of 3.75 per cent to 4 per cent. They expect the Fed funds rate to peak at 4.7 per cent by March.

Hard landing

The Fed’s hawkishness has brought on crushing losses for global stocks, rapidly rising yields on government debt, and an explosive US dollar that has aggravated weak conditions in overseas markets.

The US Producer Price Index rebounded more than expected in September with a 0.4 per cent gain versus August, taking annual input prices 8.5 per cent higher. “The ongoing strength in prices will put pressure on the Fed Reserve to continue to aggressively hike rates,” said Brian Martin, head of G3 economics at ANZ.

Ahead of the consumer price index data due late Thursday AEDT, economists forecast annual inflation to rise 8.1 per cent, slowing from an 8.3 per cent clip.

Joe Capurso, head of international economics at CBA, said the global macro backdrop rather than the RBA tightening cycle has more bearing on the Australian dollar and the US CPI data will be particularly important. “An upside surprise could push AUD below US62¢ this week,” he said.

Extension

In Britain, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said pension funds hit by a spike in UK gilt yields had three days to fix their problems before the central bank ends its emergency bond-buying scheme.

The BoE has also indicated privately to lenders that it was prepared to extend support beyond Friday’s deadline if necessary, according to the Financial Times.

The gap between two- and 10-year US yields, a reliable indicator of recession, stood at minus 39 basis points. When short-term borrowing costs exceed those in the longer-term, that suggests an economic contraction within one to two years. The US yield curve has been inverted since July.

US Treasury yields eased 5 basis points on Wednesday, with the two-year, which reflects interest rate expectations, at 4.29 per cent and the 10-year at 3.9 per cent.

Australian bond yields fell in sympathy, with the three-year rate down 6 basis points to 3.47 per cent. The return on the 10-year bond dipped 5 basis points to 3.97 per cent.

Australian bond futures are fully priced for a 0.25 percentage point lift in the cash rate in November, taking the Reserve Bank’s benchmark rate to 2.85 per cent."

The minutes of the September meeting showed many Fed officials stressed the cost of not doing enough to bring down inflation.

At the September meeting, Fed officials raised interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point for the third straight time in an effort to drive inflation down from 40-year highs.

Recently, Fed officials in their speeches have come out ""in unison regarding the Fed's commitment toward curtailing inflation and staying the course,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist, LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina.

""There's an understanding now the Fed is going to keep going. The question for the market is where is the transition from 75 basis points to 50 and 25. That is what the market is focused on I think.""

Data earlier in the day showed a surprise rise in September producer prices. The Labor Department's producer prices index rose 8.5 per cent in the 12 months through September, slightly higher than an estimated 8.4 per cent rise. Still, the reading was lower than an 8.7 per cent increase in August.

According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 lost 11.70 points, or 0.33 per cent, to end at 3,577.14 points, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 8.26 points, or 0.08 per cent, to 10,417.93. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 24.23 points, or 0.08 per cent, to 29,214.96.

This would take the cash rate to 2.85 per cent from nine-year high of 2.6 per cent

Commonwealth Bank is forecasting just one more Reserve Bank interest rate rise

The Commonwealth Bank believes the Reserve Bank of Australia is almost done raising interest rates because it has gone hard enough already to combat inflation.

Borrowers this month copped the sixth straight monthly increase in the cash rate, now at a nine-year high of 2.6 per cent, in the most severe hikes since 1994.

This means a borrower with an average $600,000 mortgage will see their monthly repayments climb by another $89 to $3,055.

Another rate rise in November, on Melbourne Cup Day, would stretch borrowers even more.

More rate rises mean the banks are able to lend less, which in turn leads to falling house prices.

The Commonwealth Bank - the only major bank to correctly predict a smaller 0.25 percentage point increase for October - is forecasting the RBA cash rate will peak after just one more hike next month.

Gareth Aird, the Commonwealth Bank's head of Australian economics, said his forecast of a 2.85 per cent cash rate in November would be well above the RBA's designated 2.5 per cent 'neutral' level - which means any rate above that would be designed to slow economic activity.

'We believe monetary policy is now comfortably in the contractionary zone,' he said.

CBA, Australia's biggest home lender, is the only big bank which forecasts the cash rate peaking at less than 3 per cent.

However, Mr Aird said there was an outside chance of another 0.25 percentage point hike in December which would take the cash rate to 3.1 per cent.

A Reserve Bank report released on Friday noted a series of interest rates rises increased the risk of a small minority of borrowers defaulting on their loan - meaning they are 90 days or more behind on their repayments.

This would be more likely if borrowers lost their job and were forced to sell as house price kept on falling, leaving them owing more than their home was worth - a situation known as negative equity.

'A large decline in housing prices that results in negative equity for households, alongside further shocks to disposable income, would increase the risk that some borrowers default on their loan commitments,' the Reserve Bank said it its Financial Stability Review.

The RBA is also concerned about mortgage arrears, where a borrower is 30 days or more behind on their repayments.

'As such, housing loan arrears rates are likely to increase from low levels in the period ahead,' it said.

'A small number of borrowers have both high debt relative to their income and low saving and equity buffers; these households are particularly vulnerable to shocks.'

Inflation in the year to July climbed by 7 per cent, the highest since December 1990.

The consumer price index moderated to 6.8 per cent in August but this was still more than double the RBA's 2 to 3 per cent target.

The Australian Bureau of Statistics is releasing inflation data for the September quarter on October 26, six days before the Reserve Bank's November meeting.

The six straight monthly RBA rate increases since May set a record for consecutive hikes since the Reserve Bank began publishing a target cash rate in 1990.

29639630-86f6-4f8b-80de-bc8f2d81747f,"As a long-standing skeptic of the idea that economics should be considered a hard science alongside chemistry and physics, I wasn’t planning to write about this year’s Nobel in Economics, which was announced on Monday. The prize committee changed my mind. In honoring Douglas Diamond, of the University of Chicago; Philip Dybvig, of Washington University in St Louis; and Ben Bernanke, the longtime Princeton professor who served as chairman of the Federal Reserve from 2006 to 2014, the committee highlighted some pioneering research on banks and financial crises that is nearly forty years old, but still highly relevant.

So far, the current financial flap in Britain, which began with a new Conservative government’s unfunded tax cuts destabilizing the markets, hasn’t had a huge impact on this side of the Atlantic. But on Tuesday the Bank of England widened an emergency bond-buying program it announced last month and warned of “a material risk to U.K. financial stability,” and then further unnerved investors later in the day by saying the bond-buying program would end this Friday. More tremors are likely ahead as the Federal Reserve and other central banks raise interest rates to quell inflation.

At a press conference after the announcement of the Nobels, Diamond said the American banking system is sounder than it was in the run-up to the financial crisis of 2008. But he also noted that, in times of stress, the sorts of vulnerabilities that he and Dybvig identified in their research can materialize in other key financial institutions, such as insurance companies or mutual funds. Even “a well-structured financial system is very vulnerable to the fear of fear itself,” he said.

In a paper from 1983, Diamond and Dybvig explained why banks play such a crucial role in the economy, and why, during certain moments, they are vulnerable to runs on their deposits that can rapidly cause their collapse. Bernanke’s contribution, in a separate 1983 paper, was to show how the failure of the Fed during the early nineteen-thirties to prevent a series of bank failures vastly accentuated the Great Depression. After joining the Fed as a governor, in 2002, he vowed that the central bank wouldn’t repeat this costly error.

Six years later, Bernanke initially appeared to be ignoring his own advice. In September, 2008, Bernanke, along with Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, took the fateful decision to let Lehman Brothers declare bankruptcy. When a full-blown financial crisis erupted, however, Bernanke heeded the lesson of the thirties, and the message of Diamond and Dybvig, going all out to prevent a wholesale collapse of the banking system. He encouraged Congress to bail out the biggest banks. Meanwhile, the Fed introduced a number of emergency lending programs, and it also cranked up its digital printing press to provide the financial system with trillions of dollars in additional liquidity—a policy known as quantitative easing. Some of these actions proved controversial—who likes bailing out irresponsible, greedy bankers?—but they also put an end to the panic and helped insure that the recession which followed the financial crisis was not as deep or extended as the Great Depression.

The cataclysm of 2008 discredited an entire way of economic thinking. Before the financial crisis, Wall Street lobbyists and free-market economists had claimed that banks could be left to their own devices, and that, if some of them did get into trouble, the regenerative powers of the free market would somehow prevent a broader economic calamity. Many macroeconomists, meanwhile, had become besotted with mathematical models of the economy that didn’t even include a proper financial sector. It took a peculiar blindness to the history of capitalism to truly believe in these approaches. Ironically, though, it was this sort of magical thinking that the Nobel committee in Stockholm had honored for decades.

The economics prize—unlike the prizes in physics, chemistry, medicine, and literature—didn’t exist until 1968. It “came out of strife between Social Democracy and business elites in Sweden,” the economic historians Avner Offer and Gabriel Söderberg pointed out in their 2016 book, “The Nobel Factor.” The Swedish central bank, which has close ties to the country’s business and financial élite, endowed the new prize. And under the guidance of Assar Lindbeck, a Swedish economist who was skeptical of the welfare state, the prize committee presented the award to a long string of economists associated with the free-market economics of the University of Chicago, or the Chicago School. Between 1974 and 1995, these recipients included Friedrich Hayek, Ronald Coase, George Stigler, and Milton Friedman. During the same period, many noted left-leaning economists, including John Kenneth Galbraith, Joan Robinson, and Hyman Minsky, were overlooked.

Not all of the conservative honorees took a cavalier approach to banking supervision. Friedman, for one, strongly believed that the Fed needed to keep banks afloat in a crisis. But the over-all message of the Chicago School was that governments should take a hands-off approach to capitalist enterprises, including those operating in the financial sector. As Offer and Söderberg emphasized in their book, the prize committee helped to legitimize this line of thought, and the sharp rightward turn in policymaking that it helped inspire.

This year’s prizes are, perhaps, a belated effort by the Stockholm committee to atone for its past sins. Since 2008, economic policymakers around the world have elevated the stability of big banks to a major policy concern, and forced them to hold a good deal more capital in reserve than they used to do. Also, in good university economics programs these days, gaining a reasonable working knowledge of the banking system, and its potential vulnerabilities, is part of the standard macroeconomics curriculum.

Some on the right refuse to modify their views, however. In an article reacting to the Nobel announcement, the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal argued that Bernanke’s “insights worked in theory but not in practice.” Given the success he had in helping to prevent another Great Depression, this argument is unfounded, but the Journal did raise a pertinent point. While creating new money and pouring it into the financial system, a policy the Fed reprised in early 2020 when the coronavirus pandemic spooked markets, can stop a financial panic, it can also create longer-term dangers. The economists Viral Acharya and Raghuram Rajan warn in a new article that many actors in the financial sector “become dependent on easy liquidity,” and “monetary policymakers thus find themselves in a very difficult position.” To bring down inflation, central banks want to withdraw money from the economy and push up interest rates. But in doing so, they raise the probability of another financial earthquake.

Out there somewhere, perhaps, there is a budding Keynes, or a budding Bernanke, with a workable solution to this conundrum. If there is, they should get in touch straight away with the Bank of England or the Fed. The need is urgent, even though the call from Stockholm may be many years away. ♦"

This year’s Nobel prize in economic sciences has been awarded to the former chair of the US Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, and two US-based economists, Douglas W. Diamond and Philip H. Dybvig, “for research on banks and financial crises”.

The prize was announced on Monday by the Nobel panel at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm.

The committee said their work had shown in their research “why avoiding bank collapses is vital”.

Nobel prizes carry a cash award of 10 million Swedish kronor ($1.4 million) and will be handed out on December 10.

Three scientists jointly won the prize in physics on Tuesday.

Frenchman Alain Aspect, American John F. Clauser and Austrian Anton Zeilinger had shown that tiny particles can retain a connection with each other even when separated, a phenomenon known as quantum entanglement, that can be used for specialised computing and to encrypt information.

The Nobel prize in chemistry was awarded on Wednesday to Americans Carolyn R. Bertozzi and K.

French author Annie Ernaux won this year’s Nobel prize in literature Thursday.

The panel commended her for blending fiction and autobiography in books that fearlessly mine her experiences as a working-class woman to explore life in France since the 1940s.

The Nobel peace prize went to jailed Belarus human rights activist Ales Bialiatski, the Russian group Memorial and the Ukrainian organisation Centre for Civil Liberties on Friday."
921f3a41-fe2c-4205-928c-b41c908a89f7,"“Financial crises and depressions are kind of the worst thing that can happen to the economy,” said John Hassler of the Committee for the Prize in Economic Sciences. “These things can happen again. And we need to have an understanding of the mechanism behind those and what to do about it. And the laureates this year provide that.”

Bernanke, 68, who was Fed chair from early 2006 to early 2014 and is now with the Brookings Institution in Washington, examined the Great Depression of the 1930s, showing the danger of bank runs — when panicked people withdraw their savings — and how bank collapses led to widespread economic devastation. Before Bernanke, economists saw bank failures as a consequence, not a cause, of economic downturns.

Diamond, 68, based at the University of Chicago, and Dybvig, 67, who is at Washington University in St. Louis, showed how government guarantees on deposits can prevent a spiraling of financial crises. In 1983, they co-authored “Bank Runs, Deposit Insurance, and Liquidity,” which in part addressed damage from runs on banks.

Diamond said the Nobel came as a surprise. On Monday morning, he said, “I was sleeping very soundly and then all of a sudden, off went my cellphone” with good news from Nobel committee.

When it comes to the global economic turmoil created by the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s war in Ukraine, Diamond said the financial system is “much, much less vulnerable” to crises because of memories of the 2000s collapse and improved regulation.

“The problem is that these vulnerabilities of the fear of runs and dislocations and crises can show up anywhere in the financial sector. It doesn’t have to be commercial banks,” he said.

The trio’s research took on real-world significance when investors sent the financial system into a panic during fall 2008.

Bernanke, then head of the Fed, teamed up with the U.S. Treasury Department to prop up major banks and ease a shortage of credit, the lifeblood of the economy.

He slashed short-term interest rates to zero, directed the Fed’s purchases of Treasury and mortgage investments and set up unprecedented lending programs. Collectively, those steps calmed investors and fortified big banks.

They also pushed long-term interest rates to historic lows and led to fierce criticism of Bernanke, particularly from some 2012 Republican presidential candidates, that the Fed was hurting the value of the dollar and running the risk of igniting inflation later.

The Fed’s actions under Bernanke extended the authority of the central bank into unprecedented territory. They weren’t able to prevent the longest and most painful recession since the 1930s. But in hindsight, the Fed’s moves were credited with rescuing the banking system and avoiding another depression.

And Bernanke’s Fed established a precedent for the central bank to respond with speed and force to economic shocks.

When COVID-19 slammed the U.S. economy in early 2020, the Fed, under Chair Jerome Powell, quickly cut short-term interest rates back to zero and pumped money into the financial system. The aggressive intervention — along with massive government spending — quickly ended the downturn and triggered a powerful economic recovery.

But the quick comeback also came at a cost: Inflation began rising rapidly last year and now is close to 40-year highs, forcing the Fed to reverse course and raise rates to cool the economy. Central banks around the world are taking similar steps as inflation erodes consumers’ spending power.

In a groundbreaking 1983 paper, Bernanke explored the role of bank failures in deepening and lengthening the Great Depression of the 1930s.

Before that, economists cast blame on the Fed for not printing enough money to support the economy as it sank. Bernanke agreed but found that the shortage of money could not explain why the depression was so devastating and lasted so long.

The problem, he found, was the collapse of the banking system. Panicked savers pulled money out of rickety banks, which then could not make the loans that kept the economy growing.

“The result,” the Nobel committee wrote, “was the worst global recession in modern history.’’

Simon Johnson, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has written about the financial crisis, said Bernanke “really shifted the attention onto banks and pointed out that it was the declining credit of the ’30s that caused the trouble.”

Bernanke’s insights, Johnson said, led policymakers to ask: “‘What do we need to do to prevent the banks from collapsing? And let’s do whatever it takes.’ That is a very powerful idea in the policy world.”

The economics award capped a week of Nobel Prize announcements in medicine, physics, chemistry and literature as well as the Peace Prize.

They carry a cash award of 10 million Swedish kronor (nearly $900,000) and will be handed out on Dec. 10.

Unlike the other prizes, the economics award wasn’t established in Alfred Nobel’s will of 1895 but by the Swedish central bank in his memory. The first winner was selected in 1969.

77f6bf41-d224-4a05-bb2b-963b2c600ef2,"As you know, former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke was just awarded a Nobel Prize in economics. A friend of mine suggested it was the worst Nobel economics prize since Paul Krugman.

I'm not sure I'd go quite that far, but that's probably because I know Ben and respect him as a fine public servant and a very good former professor of Princeton. In fact, being a Republican on the Princeton faculty is not an easy thing.

So there, this is not personal, but, but, but, but, I think his stop-and-go policies, especially in the early 2000's, when he kept interest rates too low for too long, when he created way too much high-powered liquidity, when he took a strong dollar and made it a weak dollar and when all his unsound fine-tuning created a boom in gold, commodities and housing — I think it was a big bungle and that bungle led to a financial meltdown, most especially a mortgage meltdown that he had to rescue us out of later on.

It's like a fireman who starts the fire and then wants to take credit for putting it out. Not good. It's all too reminiscent of the mistakes J. Powell made almost 2 years ago.

AMERICANS' INFLATION EXPECTATIONS DROPPED AGAIN IN SEPTEMBER, NEW YORK FED SAYS

Bernanke post-9/11 was worried about deflation, so he authored a major league money supply helicopter drop, when in fact the George W. Bush tax cuts successfully boosted post-9/11 economic growth.

I raise this because Bush moved to the supply side. He doesn’t get credit for it, but he should. He chopped down the top personal tax rate and obliterated the tax rates on capital gains and dividends.

So, when everything was taxed less, including investment, we got more of it and the Bush boom did not require a major opening of the monetary spigots. We were doing fine, the supply side worked, the Laffer curve worked, but Ben Bernanke wasn't watching and that's what got everybody into trouble. Sound familiar?

Post-Covid, the V-shaped recovery in late 2020 and early 2021 was ignored by the Biden socialists and the J. Powell modern monetary theorists. Remember?

Everybody was cheerleading for a $2 trillion stimulus package. That is, everybody in the left-wing camp, but we didn't need it, it started a big inflation and J. Powell opened those monetary spigots wider and wider. Even though the economy was growing at 6% — bequeathed by Donald Trump's tax cuts, deregulation and energy dominance.

So, here we are again. Only it's a reverse rescue. Bernanke had to save America, he thought, by turning the spigots on, then off, then back on again. J. Powell kept the spigots on, opened them wider and now he is crunching down til there's no tomorrow.

I don't know if this is modern monetary theory, or what, but I do know that in both cases it was bad monetary practice. There's an easier and softer way. Keep the dollar steady in relation to commodities and real goods, keep the spigots at medium-open and we'll have price stability. Leave the growth incentives to tax and regulatory and limited spending policies where it belongs.

The monetary lever is for inflation, the fiscal lever is for growth. Beginning with Ronald Reagan, Jack Kemp and Art Laffer and Steve Forbes and a whole bunch of us — we've been saying this for over four decades.

Now, one more point about Ben Bernanke. I don't know why he and others are so determined to bail out failing institutions. We had a chance during that financial crisis to get rid of some real turkeys, like Fannie and Freddie — who should've been privatized or remember the craziness: Bear Sterns was bailed out. Merrill was sold and Lehman was left to fail. Whole parts of AIG insurance could've been dumped or junked, but they were bailed out.

Stanford's John Taylor has often written that it was the unknowable erratic bailout policies that did as much or even more damage to the financial world as the opening up of the monetary spigots after the crisis came upon us. Governments shouldn't pick winners and losers.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

Still, today, it's incredible to me that Fannie and Freddie are now owned — lock, stock and barrel — by the U.S. government, a.k.a. the taxpayers. We shouldn't be bailing out student loans, mortgage lenders, gasoline prices, potheads, banks, car companies, semiconductor companies, EV makers, wind and solar farms and insurance firms.

How about, make my day: no new bailouts or make my day: $31 trillion of debt has gone too far. Don't you think?

726887b5-d656-4df1-af92-f1cbbae360a4,"Ben S. Bernanke, Douglas W. Diamond and Philip H. Dybvig have won the 2022 Nobel Prize in economics ""for research on banks and financial crises."" The trio were honored for their groundbreaking work on bank runs.

The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm on Monday named Ben S. Bernanke, Douglas W. Diamond and Philip H. Dybvig as the winners of this year's Nobel economics award.

It said the US-based trio won the award ""for research on banks and financial crises.""

""Fifteen years ago, much of the world stood at the brink of a devastating economic crisis,"" Tore Ellingsen, chair of the social sciences committee at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, said at a press conference. ""Most of us were unprepared for it. However, a few academic economists were both prepared and worried. They had studied the theory of bank runs.""

Former Fed Chair among winners

Bernanke is the former chairman of the US Federal Reserve. He led the US central bank from 2006 to 2014, notably during the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In the 1980s, he argued that it was bank runs that caused the Great Depression in the 1930s, which had dramatic repercussions for the global economy.

""His insights broke with conventional wisdom, and now have solid empirical support,"" the Academy said.

Diamond is a professor of finance at the University of Chicago, where he specializes in the study of financial intermediaries, financial crises, and liquidity. Dybvig is an economist and professor of banking and finance at Washington University in St. Louis. In 1983, the pair developed the Diamond-Dybvig model of bank runs.

The Diamond-Dybvig model

The model shows how the liquidity needs of savers, who want cash on hand, are in conflict with the needs of borrowers, who prefer loans with a long maturity. This is a fundamental tension for banks, which try to channel savings into investments, i.e. loans.

In normal circumstances, this works well: banks can loan money out to borrowers, providing them with a long maturity to pay the loan back, and keeping only a small fraction of cash on hand for its customers' short-term liquidity needs. However, if all depositors try to withdraw their savings at the same time, as they do in a bank run, the banks wouldn't be able to meet all demand and would quickly go bankrupt.

Diamond and Dybvig's model suggests that bank runs are an inherent weakness to the banking system, because the bank's stability depends on what depositors expect other depositors to do. If many start withdrawing their savings, others will want to as well before the bank runs out of cash.

""Financial crises...become worse when people start to lose faith in the stability of the system,"" Diamond said in a call with journalists following the announcement.

Foundation of modern banking regulation

The trio's academic contributions provided a foundation for modern research on banking, regulation and crisis management, the Academy said. Their insights were ""invaluable"" during the global financial crisis as well as during the coronavirus pandemic. They are ""highly useful for understanding and regulating an ever changing financial system.""

The prize in Economics marks the last Nobel Prize to be announced for 2022. The winners in the categories of medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and peace were announced last week. The Nobel Prizes are traditionally awarded on December 10, the anniversary of the death of prize donor and inventor Alfred Nobel, who died in 1896. All Nobel Prizes this year are again endowed with 10 million Swedish kronor (€913,000; $886,00).

Unlike the other prizes, the Nobel Prize in Economics is not directly based on the will of the prize's founder. It was established in 1968 by the Swedish Riksbank in memory of Alfred Nobel and has been awarded since 1969.

Last year, the Canadian David Card, the US-Israeli researcher Joshua Angrist and the US-Dutchman Guido Imbens were honored for their work in the field of experimental economics.

The Bank of England is expanding its emergency bond buying operation for the second time this week, in an effort to counter what it warned was “dysfunction” in the market following Kwasi Kwarteng’s mini-Budget.

The central bank is widening the scope of its daily programme in which it buys up UK government debt, to include purchases of index-linked government bonds.

An index-linked gilt is a government bond with the interest rate on it linked to inflation.

This morning, in line with its financial stability objective, the Bank has announced that it will widen its gilt purchase operations to include index-linked gilts.https://t.co/6gHVb569Hp — Bank of England (@bankofengland) October 11, 2022

Announcing the move, the Bank said there has been a “further significant repricing of UK government debt, particularly index-linked gilts”, which could threaten the UK’s financial stability.

“Dysfunction in this market, and the prospect of self-reinforcing ‘fire sale’ dynamics, pose a material risk to UK financial stability,” the Bank warned.

It added that its latest efforts will “act as a further backstop to restore orderly market conditions”.

This £65bn bond-buying programme is due to end on Friday. Yesterday, the Bank doubled the size of its daily bond purchases, to a maximum of £10bn from £5bn.

But despite that move, UK borrowing costs hit the highest level since the turmoil immediately after the mini-budget.

The Bank of England's intervention comes after the sell-off in government bonds resumed on Monday as investor concerns failed to subside despite action by the Bank of England to double its daily bond-buying limit and Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng’s move to bring forward his new fiscal plan and independent economic forecasts to October 31.

NEW YORK/LONDON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - The pound fell to a two-week low against the dollar and euro on Tuesday, crushed by comments from Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey who reiterated the bank will end its support for the bond market on Friday despite pleas from pension funds to extend it.

Bailey told pension fund managers on Tuesday to finish rebalancing their positions by Friday when the British central bank is due to end its emergency support program for the country's fragile bond market. read more

Earlier in the session, the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association, an industry body, urged the BoE to extend the bond-buying programme until Oct. 31 ""and possibly beyond.""

Sterling slid to a two-week trough against the dollar of $1.0954 and was last down 0.8% at $1.0970. The euro rose to a two-week high versus the pound of 88.60 pence. It last traded up 0.8% at 88.45 pence .

""Governor Bailey's three-day ultimatum has caused new turmoil for UK markets and soured global risk sentiment,"" said John Doyle, vice president of trading and dealing at Monex USA in Washington.

The BoE earlier on Tuesday was forced to step into the government bond markets again to attempt to stem a damaging debt sell-off.

The BoE extended a series of debt buybacks to include inflation-linked bonds - predominantly owned by pension funds - which witnessed their biggest rout on record on Monday.

At first sale on Tuesday, the BoE bought 1.947 billion pounds ($2.15 billion) of inflation-linked debt, roughly half the maximum amount it said it would be willing to buy.

The central bank had already said it would double the amount of long-dated gilts it will buy to ensure a smooth end to its emergency buyback program.

""Potentially, there could be some clear downside risk in cable, I would think, towards $1.05 and euro/sterling towards 90.00,"" Valentin Marinov, head of G10 FX strategy at Credit Agricole said.

EXTREME VOLATILITY

Indeed, investors have ditched their exposure to the pound in the last couple of weeks. Weekly data on Friday showed speculators took an axe to both their bullish and bearish bets on the pound, given the market's extreme volatility.

One-week sterling volatility is trading at almost 20% and, while down somewhat from the spike to almost 30% in the wake of the government's mini-budget, it is still well above the average of closer to 8% that has prevailed over the last five years, according to Refinitiv data.

The pound hit a record low of $1.0327 on Sept 26. It has since recovered around 6% in value, but is still showing a nearly 19% loss so far this year, on track for its weakest annual performance against the dollar since 2008.

On Sept. 23, British Finance Minister Kwasi Kwarteng unveiled a package of unfunded tax cuts worth around 45 billion pounds, including breaks for top earners. The pound promptly nosedived and the gilts market went into a tailspin, putting pension funds at risk of insolvency.

Gilt yields soared to their highest in years, prompting the BoE to step in to buy long-dated bonds.

Kwarteng has since scrapped the plans to abolish the top rate of tax and brought forward the date he will detail his other plans.

But sterling's problems extend beyond the liquidity crunch in the gilts market. The British economy is buckling under the weight of almost double-digit inflation and is expected to tilt into recession this year due to the effects of a cost-of-living crisis, sky-high energy bills and the drag of Brexit.

Citing a ""material risk"" to financial stability arising from a rout in British government bonds - known as gilts - the BoE said it would buy up to STG5 billion of index-linked debt per day, starting Tuesday.

Rather than increase the existing commitment to buy up to STG10 billion of gilts each day, as announced on Monday, the purchases will run alongside existing purchases of long-dated conventional bonds, now worth up to STG5 billion.

The move and the increased warnings from the central bank represent another embarrassment for Prime Minister Liz Truss, whose economic agenda last month sparked a collapse in international investor confidence towards British assets.

British inflation-linked gilts - known as linkers - suffered a massive sell-off on Monday, despite the BoE doubling the maximum size of its buy-backs of conventional long-dated gilts.

Investors in British government debt are worried about what will happen to the market after most of the BoE's emergency support measures end on Friday.

Index-linked gilts are typically held by pension funds which have been scrambling to raise cash after finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng last month sparked a bond rout with plans for unfunded tax cuts.

Pension funds were forced to stump up emergency collateral in liability-driven investments (LDI), which use derivatives to safeguard against shortfalls in pension pots, after British government bond yields rocketed.

To halt freefalling prices, the BoE was forced to pledge to buy as much as STG65 billion of long-dated government bonds, known as gilts."

The duo also presented a solution to bank vulnerability, in the form of deposit insurance from the government.

Is economics a science?

The Nobel in economics was the last to be added to the prize categories more than half a century since the awards began. Notre Dame historian Philip Mirowski suggests the Swedish central bank, in looking to free itself from government oversight, started awarding the prize to frame economics as science, rather than a political subject.

Maggie Koerth, a science writer for FiveThirtyEight, agreed: “Having a Nobel Prize boosted economics’ scientific street cred,” she wrote in 2016.

But unlike physics or chemistry, economics is not a hard science. And the not-a-Nobel award’s emphasis on the primacy of the free market has been damaging at times. One laureate, Friedrich von Hayek, used his Nobel Banquet speech to critique the prize.

Quotable

“There is no reason why a man who has made a distinctive contribution to economic science should be omnicompetent on all problems of society—as the press tends to treat him till in the end he may himself be persuaded to believe. One is even made to feel it a public duty to pronounce on problems to which one may not have devoted special attention. I am not sure that it is desirable to strengthen the influence of a few individual economists by such a ceremonial and eye-catching recognition of achievements, perhaps of the distant past.”

Economics Prize winners in the last decade

A delayed Nobel

In Economics, researchers tend to be awarded well after they’ve shared their work with the world.

For example, the 1997 prize went to economists behind the Black-Scholes Model for a formula they first developed in 1973. Their collaborator Fischer Black had died by the time the prize was awarded.

In 2016, the prize went to economists who worked on “contract theory” in the 1970s and 1980s.

Person of Interest: The non-economist



In 1978, Herbert A. Simon became the first non-economist to win the Economics Prize. He was Ph.D. was in political science who won for his pioneering research into the decision-making process within economic organizations.

“Simon has been awarded this year’s prize in economics for his research into the decision-making process within economic organizations, but he has also made other important contributions to the science of economics,” the Nobel Committee wrote. “For example, his interest in simplifying and understanding complex decision-making situations led him at an early stage to the problem of breaking down complex equation systems. His studies of ‘causal order’ in such systems have been of particular importance.”

Bernanke, who chaired the Fed during the 2008 financial crisis, received the award for his research on the Great Depression. Stockholm University economist John Hassler announced the prize, saying the laureates' work was crucial to understanding and addressing the 2008 crisis.

""The measures that were undertaken rest on the ideas that we recognize today,"" Hassler said.

Diamond said the award came as a surprise, per the Journal. ""I was sleeping very soundly, and then all of a sudden, off went my cellphone,"" he said."
12f1c0c0-5ddd-4441-b20a-a2f0d476fcca,"Former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and two other prominent economists who have done research on banking and financial crises won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences.

The honor was announced on Monday. Douglas Diamond of the University of Chicago and Philip Dybvig of Washington University in St. Louis were the other two economists recognized by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm.

STRONG SEPTEMBER JOBS REPORT RAISES FEARS FED WON’T BE ABLE TO AVOID RECESSION

The Royal Academy said the three economists' research helped show “why avoiding bank collapses is vital,” the academy said. The research for which the three economists were given the award was published in the 1980s and detailed how banks relate to the economy and can cause financial crises like the one experienced in 2008.

“Financial crises and depressions are kind of the worst thing that can happen to the economy,” said John Hassler of the Committee for the Prize in Economic Sciences. “These things can happen again. And we need to have an understanding of the mechanism behind those and what to do about it. And the laureates this year provide that.”

Bernanke briefly led former President George W. Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers. He was then the Fed chairman from 2006 to 2014, presiding over the global financial crisis and the most crushing recession since the Great Depression. He helped engineer the bailouts of the financial sector and led the Fed as it slashed interest rates to near zero and commissioned massive purchases of government bonds in a then-unprecedented effort to prop up the U.S. economy.

Current Fed Chairman Jerome Powell took a page out of Bernanke’s book in 2020, when he dropped rates as the pandemic took hold and menaced the prospects of another massive economic upheaval. Those efforts have since backfired, as inflation threatens yet another recession.

Bernanke said earlier this year that the central bank waited too long in addressing inflation.

“The question is why did they delay that? ... Why did they delay their response? I think in retrospect, yes, it was a mistake,” he told CNBC. “And I think they agree it was a mistake.”

Dybvig and Diamond were awarded for their research examining the relationship between banks and savers and borrowers."
058bd519-3e19-4261-9188-1400eb27f00d,"Dr Diamond, 68, based at the University of Chicago, and Dr Dybvig, 67, who is at Washington University in St. Louis, showed how government guarantees on deposits and can prevent a spiralling of financial crises. In 1983, they co-authored “Bank Runs, Deposit Insurance, and Liquidity”, which in part addressed damage from runs on banks.

Dr Diamond said the Nobel came as a surprise. On Monday morning, he said, “I was sleeping very soundly and then all of a sudden, off went my cellphone” with good news from Nobel committee.

When it comes to the global economic turmoil created by the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s war in Ukraine, Dr Diamond said the financial system is “much, much less vulnerable” to crises because of memories of the 2000s collapse and improved regulation.

Real-world significance

“The problem is that these vulnerabilities of the fear of runs and dislocations and crises can show up anywhere in the financial sector. It doesn’t have to be commercial banks,” he said.

The trio’s research took on great real-world significance when investors sent the financial system into a panic during fall 2008.

Dr Bernanke, then head of the Fed, teamed up with the US Treasury Department to prop up major banks and ease a shortage of credit, the lifeblood of the economy.

He slashed short-term interest rates to zero, directed the Fed’s purchases of Treasury and mortgage investments and set up unprecedented lending programs. Collectively, those steps calmed investors and fortified big banks.

They also pushed long-term interest rates to historic lows and led to fierce criticism of Dr Bernanke, particularly from some 2012 Republican presidential candidates, that the Fed was hurting the value of the dollar and running the risk of igniting inflation later.

The Fed’s actions under Dr Bernanke extended the authority of the central bank into unprecedented territory. They weren’t able to prevent the longest and most painful recession since the 1930s. But in hindsight, the Fed’s moves were credited with rescuing the banking system and avoiding another depression.

And Dr Bernanke’s Fed established a precedent for the central bank to respond with speed and force to economic shocks.

When COVID-19 slammed the US economy in early 2020, the Fed, under Chair Jerome Powell, quickly cut short-term interest rates back to zero and pumped money into the financial system. The aggressive intervention – along with massive government spending – quickly ended the downturn and triggered a powerful economic recovery.

But the quick comeback also came at a cost: inflation began rising rapidly last year and now is close to 40-year highs, forcing the Fed to reverse course and raise rates to cool the economy. Central banks around the world are also taking the steps as inflation erodes consumers’ spending power.

In a groundbreaking 1983 paper, Dr Bernanke explored the role of bank failures in deepening and lengthening the Great Depression of the 1930s.

Before that, economists cast blame on the Fed for not printing enough money to support the economy as it sank. Dr Bernanke agreed but found that the shortage of money could not explain why the depression was so devastating and lasted so long. The problem, he found, was the collapse of the banking system. Panicked savers pulled money out of rickety banks, which then could not make the loans that kept the economy growing.

“The result,” the Nobel committee wrote, “was the worst global recession in modern history.”

The 2022 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, more commonly known as the Nobel prize for economics, has been awarded to Ben Bernanke, Douglas Diamond and Philip Dybvig for their research on banks and financial crises.

Bernanke is a former Federal Reserve chairman who steered the central bank through the financial crisis of 2008. He received the award with fellow economists Diamond and Dybvig.

The trio sought to highlight the role of banks in the economy, particularly during financial crises, as well as how to regulate financial markets, and why avoiding bank collapses is vital.

""The laureates' insights have improved our ability to avoid both serious crises and expensive bailouts,"" Tore Ellingsen, chair of the committee for the Prize in Economic Sciences said.

This is the 54th Nobel prize for economics that the institution awarded since 1969. The winner receives a cash award for 10 million Swedish kronor ($884,230, £798,090), a diploma, and a gold medal, all of which will be handed over at a formal ceremony in Stockholm on 10 December.

Bernanke's work examined the Great Depression of the 1930s, one of the worst economic crisis in modern history, showing how bank runs were a decisive factor in the crisis becoming so deep and prolonged.

""Among other things, he showed how bank runs were a decisive factor in the crisis becoming so deep and prolonged,"" the committee noted. ""When the banks collapsed, valuable information about borrowers was lost and could not be recreated quickly. Society’s ability to channel savings to productive investments was thus severely diminished.""

Diamond's and Dybvig's work took a closer look at how banks offer an optimal solution to this problem.

""By acting as intermediaries that accept deposits from many savers, banks can allow depositors to access their money when they wish, while also offering long-term loans to borrowers,"" the committee said.

""Diamond demonstrated how banks perform another societally important function. As intermediaries between many savers and borrowers, banks are better suited to assessing borrowers’ creditworthiness and ensuring that loans are used for good investments.""

What drove markets

Major indexes finished lower for a fourth consecutive session on Monday as concerns about additional rate hikes by the Fed continued to damp sentiment. Dow industrials, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq all fell to session lows after a CNBC interview with Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan JPM, +1.19% , who said the S&P 500 could fall by “another easy 20%” from current levels.

Soft data a week ago had raised hopes that the Fed would soon pause its monetary tightening cycle in its battle to suppress multidecade high inflation, and the market subsequently rebounded off its near two-year lows. But a strong jobs report on Friday crushed that Fed “pivot” narrative and stocks plunged again.

On Monday, the CBOE Vix index VIX, +1.17% , a gauge of expected S&P 500 volatility, sat at 32.15, well above its long-term average of 20.

“The low interest-rate environment forced investors to chase yield and bid up the asset prices too high. Eventually the market is fair and asset values have to achieve some sense of common ground or base level valuation. So it was inevitable that this valuation correction would happen,” said Siddharth Singhai, chief investment officer for New York-based hedge fund IronHold Capital.



“Panic will swing the market towards excessive pessimism and then the valuations will be too cheap. That hasn’t happened yet. Upcoming rate hikes will most likely be a catalyst for panic, however,” he wrote in an email to MarketWatch on Monday.



Coming into Monday’s session, trading had been expected to be somewhat thinned by the Columbus Day and Indigenous People’s Day holiday, which closed the Treasury market.



Now, traders are looking toward more data later in the week for further guidance on Fed thinking and equity valuations. The U.S. producer price numbers will be released on Wednesday and the consumer prices report on Thursday, the last of their kind before the Fed’s policy decision on Nov. 2.



Then on Friday, third-quarter corporate earnings season really kicks into gear when big banks like JPMorgan JPM, +1.19% and Citigroup C, +1.77% present their numbers.

Wall Street has been roiled by worries over stubbornly hot inflation and the Federal Reserve's plan to tame high prices by raising interest rates. The goal is to slow economic growth and cool both borrowing and spending to get inflation under control, but the plan risks sending the economy into a recession.

Investors will potentially get a more detailed picture of the Fed's thinking on Wednesday when the central bank releases minutes from its latest policy meeting. That’s when the Fed made another extra-big interest rate increase of three-quarters of a percentage point.

“Nobody’s arguing about whether inflation is falling, it's simply the slope of the slide,” said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds. “The inflation battle is being won and the problem is the recession battle may be getting lost unnecessarily.”

Wall Street will also get important updates on inflation and more insight into how that is impacting retail sales. The closely watched report on consumer prices will be released on Thursday and a report on retail sales is due Friday.

The latest sales update could confirm that consumers are increasingly stretched financially, or at least pulling back on spending. That could send a signal to the Fed, Kelly said.

""I’m just hoping the Fed is watching these indicators,"" he said. “It should tell them they're much closer to both beating inflation and killing the economy than they think they are.”

This week brings the latest round of corporate earnings reports, which could provide a clearer picture of how high prices are impacting revenue and profits and what's expected for the rest of the year and even into 2023.

Inflation is a bit like toothpaste: once you get it out of the tube, it’s hard to get it back in, right?”

Billionaire hedge-fund investor Paul Tudor Jones, founder of Tudor Investment Corporation, said investors looking to time the bottom in stocks should keep a close eye on short-term Treasury yields.

Speaking Monday during an interview with CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” Jones said he expects stocks and bonds will continue to sink as the U.S. economy slides into a recession in the months ahead.

But while retail investors book losses on both their stocks and bonds, the explosion of volatility across markets is creating plenty of opportunities for macro traders like Jones, who tend to outperform when markets turn choppy.

“These are spectacular times for macro, and great times for macro are generally not great times for general investment,” Jones said.

“Macro works when everything is broken a bit. That’s when you have the volatility that’s really best for the type of trading that I do.”

Volatility has soared across asset classes and markets as the Federal Reserve has begun the process of shrinking the size of its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet while hiking interest rates at the most aggressive pace since the 1980s. The Fed isn’t alone, of course — dozens of central banks around the world are raising interest rates as well.

The ICE BofA MOVE Index, which tracks fixed-income volatility, touched its highest level since 2007 late last month when it hit 158.99 before easing somewhat.

The CBOE Volatility Index VIX, +1.17% , otherwise known as the VIX, or the Wall Street “fear gauge,” climbed to 33.07 on Monday as the S&P 500 turned lower. The level of the Vix is based on trading in short-dated options on the S&P 500.

Currency-market volatility has also surged as the U.S. dollar, the world’s most popular reserve currency, has strengthened at the most rapid pace in years thanks in part to the Fed.

The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.31% , a measure of the greenback’s strength against a basket of rivals, has climbed nearly 18% since Jan. 1. The index was up 0.3% on Monday to 113.15.

Asked how investors should navigate markets during a recession, Jones said he has a “playbook” that has worked in the past.

According to this playbook, Jones expects “short-term rates will stop going up, and start going down” before U.S. stocks finally bottom.

Based on this theory, Jones said 2-year Treasurys TMUBMUSD02Y, 4.355% are starting to look attractive as yields have risen more than 3.5 percentage points since the start of the year. Bond prices fall as yields climb.

Market strategists have been saying for weeks that moves in short-term yields have been driving swings in stocks and the dollar.

See: The stock market is surging as the U.S. dollar retreats. It’s all about bonds.

Ultimately, Jones expects the turning point for Treasury yields will help to usher in a massive rally for assets that have tumbled as inflation surged. Even cryptocurrencies like bitcoin BTCUSD, +0.10% will likely benefit, he said.

“When we get into that recession there will be a point when the Fed stops hiking and it starts to either slow down, or even at some point it will reverse those cuts, and you’ll have a massive rally in a variety of beaten down inflation trades including crypto,” Jones said.

See: Why stock-market investors keep falling for Fed ‘pivot’ talk — and what it will take to put in a bottom

Jones also said he keeps a small allocation to crypto.

“We’re going to have to have fiscal retrenchment. In a time where there’s too much money, something like crypto, specifically bitcoin and ethereum, that will have value at some point,” he said."

The already-battered stock market will face further pressure under a ""recession playbook"" laid out by billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones.

""That playbook is: most recessions last about 300 days from the commencement of it; the stock market is down, say, 10%; the first thing that will happen will be short rates will stop going up and will start going down before the stock market actually bottoms,"" he said in a CNBC interview that aired Monday.

The founder and chief investment officer of Tudor Investment said the US economy may have entered into a recession one or two months ago but an official declaration will come from the National Bureau of Economic Research.

""We're probably getting ready to go through the recession playbook,"" Jones said.

The world's largest economy contracted by 0.6% in the second quarter of 2022, according to the Commerce Department. That came on the heels of gross domestic product shrinking by 1.6% in the first quarter. The first GDP estimate for the third quarter is due on October 27.

US stocks this year have tumbled into a bear market as investors anticipate the Federal Reserve's fast pace of hefty rate hikes to cool inflation will lead to a so-called hard landing for the economy. The S&P 500 has lost about 24% and the Nasdaq Composite has slumped by nearly 33%.

""I would say when we get into that recession, there will be a point when the Fed stops hiking,"" Jones said. ""There will be a point when it starts to either slow down or, even at some point, it'll reverse those cuts. And when that happens you'll probably have a massive rally in a variety of beaten-down inflation trades, including crypto.""

He said he has a ""minor"" allocation to bitcoin. ""I've always had a small allocation to it.""

Bitcoin has dropped by nearly 60% this year and traded around $19,190 on Monday. In November, it hit an all-time high above $68,000 before falling into a ""crypto winter"" of depressed prices in the market for digital assets.

Next month, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates for the sixth time this year. The fed funds rate has been yanked up to a range of 3% to 3.25% from 0%."

This is despite its highly correlated moves with the risk-on market, not to mention stagnant price action lately, with the past month seeing the BTC price ranging between $18,300 and $20,400.

Tudor Jones did not quantify what was meant by “minor” and “small.” Nonetheless, some have interpreted his words as bullish in that he continues to hold despite wider capitulation during the bear market.

Time to face the music

Speaking to Andrew Sorkin on CNBC’s Squawk Box, Tudor Jones set the scene by summarizing financial crises and dominant narratives from each decade since the 90s.

When it came to the 2020s, he described a scenario in which previous excesses, i.e., the “massive experimentation” of low-interest rates and uncurbed money printing, come home to roost.

“The 20s, I’m afraid, are going to be that period where we really focus on debt dynamics country by country, fiscal deficits, and the need to run, certainly fiscal policy, in a way that gives people confidence in the long run value of the currency.”

With that, going into this decade, Tudor Jones foresees “fiscal retrenchment,” which he described as the polar opposite of what was experienced during the last decade.

Bitcoin’s inflationary hedge narrative still stands with Tudor Jones

In an inflationary environment with excess government spending, the hedge fund manager said he sees merit in holding Bitcoin and Ethereum due to their fixed supply.

“In a time when there’s too much money, which is why we have inflation, and too much fiscal spending, something like crypto, specifically Bitcoin and Ethereum, where there’s a finite amount of that, that will have value at some point.”

He added that he doesn’t know when significant price appreciation will occur, but “it will have value” when the time comes.

Injecting, Sorkin clarified by asking, value at a much higher number than today? Tudor Jones said, “oh, I think so, yeah.”

In response to the interview, gold-bug Peter Schiff played down the significance of Tudor Jones’ “minor” allocation, saying this is not the “compelling endorsement” cryptocurrency advocates believe it to be.

Schiff’s tweet did not comment on future crypto price appreciation.

Billionaire hedge-fund investor Paul Tudor Jones, founder of Tudor Investment Corporation, said investors looking to time the bottom in stocks should keep a close eye on short-term Treasury yields.

Speaking Monday during an interview with CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” Jones said he expects stocks and bonds will continue to sink as the U.S. economy slides into a recession in the months ahead.

But while retail investors book losses on both their stocks and bonds, the explosion of volatility across markets is creating plenty of opportunities for macro traders like Jones, who tend to outperform when markets turn choppy.

“These are spectacular times for macro, and great times for macro are generally not great times for general investment,” Jones said.

“Macro works when everything is broken a bit. That’s when you have the volatility that’s really best for the type of trading that I do.”

Volatility has soared across asset classes and markets as the Federal Reserve has begun the process of shrinking the size of its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet while hiking interest rates at the most aggressive pace since the 1980s. The Fed isn’t alone, of course — dozens of central banks around the world are raising interest rates as well.

The ICE BofA MOVE Index, which tracks fixed-income volatility, touched its highest level since 2007 late last month when it hit 158.99 before easing somewhat.

The CBOE Volatility Index otherwise known as the VIX, or the Wall Street “fear gauge,” climbed to 33.07 on Monday as the S&P 500 turned lower. The level of the Vix is based on trading in short-dated options on the S&P 500.

Currency-market volatility has also surged as the U.S. dollar, the world’s most popular reserve currency, has strengthened at the most rapid pace in years thanks in part to the Fed.

The ICE U.S. Dollar Index a measure of the greenback’s strength against a basket of rivals, has climbed nearly 18% since Jan. 1. The index was up 0.3% on Monday to 113.15.

Asked how investors should navigate markets during a recession, Jones said he has a “playbook” that has worked in the past.

According to this playbook, Jones expects “short-term rates will stop going up, and start going down” before U.S. stocks finally bottom.

Based on this theory, Jones said 2-year Treasurys are starting to look attractive as yields have risen more than 3.5 percentage points since the start of the year. Bond prices fall as yields climb.

Market strategists have been saying for weeks that moves in short-term yields have been driving swings in stocks and the dollar.

See: The stock market is surging as the U.S. dollar retreats. It’s all about bonds.

Ultimately, Jones expects the turning point for Treasury yields will help to usher in a massive rally for assets that have tumbled as inflation surged. Even cryptocurrencies like bitcoin will likely benefit, he said.

“When we get into that recession there will be a point when the Fed stops hiking and it starts to either slow down, or even at some point it will reverse those cuts, and you’ll have a massive rally in a variety of beaten down inflation trades including crypto,” Jones said.

See: Why stock-market investors keep falling for Fed ‘pivot’ talk — and what it will take to put in a bottom

Jones also said he keeps a small allocation to crypto.

“We’re going to have to have fiscal retrenchment. In a time where there’s too much money, something like crypto, specifically bitcoin and ethereum, that will have value at some point,” he said.

Stocks fell for a fourth straight session on Monday as the S&P 500 dropped 0.8% to 3,612.39. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.3% to 29,202.88 and the Nasdaq Composite declined 1% to 10,542.10."
e17ecbc0-e31f-4640-a537-486c107c3f62,"""I still have a minor allocation to bitcoin,"" said Paul Tudor Jones during a CNBC appearance on Monday morning.

It wasn't exactly a rousing endorsement of the crypto given Jones' major bullishness two-plus years ago. At the time, in mid-2020, the hedge fund giant said he had allocated 1%-2% of his multibillion-dollar portfolio to bitcoin (BTC).

He later said he could see allocating as much as 5% of his assets to bitcoin if the U.S. Federal Reserve continued on its path of monetary debasement. His remarks at that time helped pump crypto prices – then already in a bull market – even higher.

His milquetoast remarks on digital assets today were hardly noticed, with the price of bitcoin remaining mired in the low-$19,000 area.

In 2020, of course, the Fed was in the midst of any number of stimulus schemes aimed at keeping the economy and financial system afloat alongside the COVID-19 lockdowns. Today, the U.S. central bank is in the exact opposite mode as it rapidly tightens monetary policy to fight the inflation surge it helped create.

""Inflation is a bit like toothpaste,"" said Jones this morning. ""Once you get it out of the tube, it’s hard to get it back in."" The Fed, he said, ""is furiously trying to wash that taste out of [its] mouth ... If we go into recession, that has really negative consequences for a variety of assets.""

While Jones said he continues to believe bitcoin will have value, he concluded that cash is the place to be as long as the Fed can be counted on to follow through on its pledge to bring inflation back to the 2% target."
f07902e5-ff9d-4f77-ad5f-32371041395b,"""That playbook is: most recessions last about 300 days from the commencement of it; the stock market is down, say, 10%; the first thing that will happen will be short rates will stop going up and will start going down before the stock market actually bottoms,"" he said in a CNBC interview that aired Monday.

The founder and chief investment officer of Tudor Investment said the US economy may have entered into a recession one or two months ago but an official declaration will come from the National Bureau of Economic Research.

""We're probably getting ready to go through the recession playbook,"" Jones said.

The world's largest economy contracted by 0.6% in the second quarter of 2022, according to the Commerce Department. That came on the heels of gross domestic product shrinking by 1.6% in the first quarter. The first GDP estimate for the third quarter is due on October 27.

US stocks this year have tumbled into a bear market as investors anticipate the Federal Reserve's fast pace of hefty rate hikes to cool inflation will lead to a so-called hard landing for the economy. The Samp;P 500 has lost about 24% and the Nasdaq Composite has slumped by nearly 33%.

""I would say when we get into that recession, there will be a point when the Fed stops hiking,"" Jones said. ""There will be a point when it starts to either slow down or, even at some point, it'll reverse those cuts. And when that happens you'll probably have a massive rally in a variety of beaten-down inflation trades, including crypto.""

He said he has a ""minor"" allocation to bitcoin. ""I've always had a small allocation to it.""

Bitcoin has dropped by nearly 60% this year and traded around $19,190 on Monday. In November, it hit an all-time high above $68,000 before falling into a ""crypto winter"" of depressed prices in the market for digital assets."

After a banking royal commission finding in 2019, financial institutions were ordered to set aside $10 billion to refund people who had purchased junk insurance.

Junk insurance refers to coverage that is either unnecessary or worthless.

Patricia did not realise she had been paying for insurance she didn’t need until she was alerted through a news story.

“I saw on the news a few months back that people were eligible for these refunds,” she told 7NEWS.com.au.

“So, I made an inquiry through Claimo, and I found out I had been paying insurance that I shouldn’t have been paying.”

Patricia explained she made an inquiry through Claimo, a service that helps consumers find and process refunds by launching an investigation on their behalf.

Five weeks later, Claimo told Patricia she was to receive a $24,000 refund.

“I didn’t even realise I was eligible, and it’s quite a bit of money I got back so it’s very exciting” she said.

Patricia is saving the refund towards a deposit for a home loan.

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission says remediation is still available for millions of Australians for “fees for no service misconduct or non-compliant advice” as well as ” junk insurance” cashback payments.

A 2019 report from the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry revealed millions of people had been duped into buying junk insurance.

New ASIC data released in September 2022 estimates a further $1.6 billion is yet to be paid to an estimated 2.7 million consumers for remediation for both junk insurance and non-compliant advice.

“Our guidance puts the onus on industry to get on with fair and timely remediations – returning the money they owe to wronged consumers,” ASIC deputy chair Karen Chester said.

“To date, ASIC has needed to oversee large-scale remediations, to ensure affected consumers were treated fairly and received the compensation they were entitled to.”

Claimo CEO Nathan Mortlock said the most common reason people bought junk insurance was because they were told it was necessary.

“A lot of the time they were told they had to have that insurance to get that home loan back in the ‘90s and also the ‘00s, and we know that’s actually not the case,” he said.

How to claim

Australians are urged to keep an eye out for any correspondence from their banks, super funds, or any other financial institutions for more information about ongoing remediation programs.

Those who are unsure about any fees are urged to contact the financial institution which charged them to find out if they have been incorrectly charged.

For those customers who had policies with Freedom Insurance, there is a specific call to action. Anyone who has been with the insurance company at any time between 2010 and 2018 is urged to come forward to see if they are eligible for a refund.

More details about the refund can be found on the ASIC website here."

Millions of Australians are eligible for refunds after having paid for junk insurance products, with more than half not even aware they are eligible.

New research from consumer remediation service Remediator, found that over 50 per cent of Australian consumers who have received junk insurance refunds either didn’t know they held the insurance in the first place or weren’t aware of all the exclusions that meant they would never be able to claim on the policy.

Junk insurance refers to add-on insurances like Consumer Credit Insurance (CCI), Guaranteed Asset Protection (GAP), Mortgage Protection Insurance and Loan Protection Insurance.

Remediator said more than 1 in 4 Australians were sold junk insurance.

“Anyone who has ever held a credit card, had a personal loan or a car loan could be eligible for a refund,” the research said.

The Royal Commission exposed the dodgy tactics banks and insurers used to sell these products, like paying as much as four times the commission to sales agents as was ever paid out to customers on policies.

The average refund amount is $1,962.76, but some have received significantly more.

Remediator said in recent weeks it has been able to deliver as much as $41,449 to a Victorian resident who had been paying for CCI.

Remediator found that he had been paying for CCI on his Westpac Credit Card for over 10 years, but he never knowingly signed up for it in the first place.

“I never thought in a million years I’d see anything refunded,” the man from Hoppers Crossing said.

“It absolutely made my decade.”

Another man, from Derrimut South Australia, received a $32,653 refund for CCI on a credit card.

Remediator CEO Monique Gasson said now is the perfect time to find out if you were charged junk insurance.

“With cost of living pressures so high now is a great time to check if you could get a refund for junk insurance policies,” Gasson said.

There are an estimated 2.7 million Australians who are owed a share in the $1.6bn sum.

The most common issues flagged by ASIC are fees for no service misconduct, non-compliant advice, mis-selling “junk insurance” or failing to deliver on price discount promises.

The “onus” is now on the financial services industry to “get on with fair and timely remediations – returning the money they owe to wronged customers,” says ASIC deputy chair Karen Chester.

ASIC has been monitoring 36 remediation activities as of June 2022 across superannuation, advice, credit, banking and insurance.

More than 3.4 million consumers have already been paid $3.25bn, however, there is still an estimated $1.6bn yet to be returned to millions of Australians.

“Licensees must also do better at identifying and remediating problems earlier to avoid the costly lag and drag of remediation,“ Ms Chester said.

Ms Chester blamed “underinvestment in systems” for a “trifecta of failures”.

“First and foremost, in delivering on promises to consumers, second in identifying the failures and third in being able to remediate consumer loss in a timely way,” she said.

“Going forward, while ASIC may need to intervene in some isolated cases, we cannot and should not oversee remediations in order for consumers to receive fair and timely outcomes.”

ASIC has overseen the remediation of at least $5.6bn for an estimated seven million Australians in the past six years.

Around $3.6bn has been paid or offered to more than 1.4 million consumers in remediation for no service misconduct or non-compliant advice.

ASIC has also overseen the insurance industry paying $1.3bn to consumers for “mis-selling junk insurance, failing to deliver on price discount promises and poor sales practices”.

The commission on Tuesday released a regulatory guide for financial firms to push them to remediate their customers “quickly and effectively”."

A spokesperson for Claimo added that they expected “millions more Aussies could be owed billions more in junk insurance refunds in addition to the ASIC remediation programs already paid”.

149cce55-2c93-481f-9e62-38a4f72f3c0e,"Loss of demand

But analysts and investors say that with the fastest inflation in decades hamstringing the ability of officials to loosen policy in the near term, this time is likely to be much different.

The Fed, unsurprisingly, represents the largest loss of demand. The central bank more than doubled its debt portfolio in the two years through early 2022, to in excess of $US8 trillion.

The sum, which includes mortgage-backed securities, could fall to $US5.9 trillion by mid-2025 if officials stick with their current roll-off plans, Fed estimates show.

While most would agree that lessening the central bank’s market-distorting influence is healthy in the long run, it nonetheless is a stark reversal for investors who have grown accustomed to the Fed’s outsized presence.

“Since the year 2000, there has always been a big central bank on the margin buying a lot of Treasuries,” said Credit Suisse investment strategist Zoltan Pozsar.

Now “we’re basically expecting the private sector to step in instead of the public sector, in a period where inflation is as uncertain as it has ever been,” Mr Pozsar said. “We’re asking the private sector to take down all these Treasuries that we are going to push back into the system, without a glitch, and without a massive premium.”

Frozen out

Still, if it was just the Fed – with its long-telegraphed balance-sheet runoff – reversing course, market angst would be much more limited.

It’s not.

Prohibitively steep hedging costs have essentially frozen Tokyo’s giant pension and life insurance companies out of the Treasury market as well. Yields on US 10-year notes have plunged well into negative territory for Japanese buyers who pay to eliminate currency fluctuations from their returns, even as nominal rates have soared above 4 per cent.

Hedging costs have surged in tandem with the dollar, which has climbed more than 25 per cent this year versus the yen, the most in Bloomberg data going back to 1972.

As the Fed has continued to boost rates to tame inflation in excess of 8 per cent, Japan in September intervened to support its currency for the first time since 1998, raising speculation the country may need to actually start selling its hoard of Treasuries to further prop up the yen.

And it’s not just Japan. Countries around the world have been running down their foreign-exchange reserves to defend their currencies against the surging dollar in recent months.

In fact, emerging-market central banks have trimmed their stockpiles by $US300 billion this year, International Monetary Fund data show.

That means limited demand at best from a group of price-insensitive investors that traditionally put about 60 per cent or more of their reserves into US dollar investments.

Over the past decade, when one or two key buyers of Treasuries has seemingly backed away, others have been there to pick up the slack.

That’s not what’s occurring this go around, said JPMorgan Chase strategist Jay Barry.

Demand from US commercial banks has dissipated as Fed policy tightening drains reserves out of the financial system. In the second quarter, banks purchased the least amount of Treasuries since the final three months of 2020, Mr Barry wrote in a report.

“The drop in bank demand has been stunning,” he noted. “As deposit growth has slowed sharply, this has reduced bank demand for Treasuries, particularly as the duration of their assets have extended sharply this year.”

It all adds up to a bearish undertone for rates, Barry added.

Still trying to evolve

Bloomberg’s US Treasury total return index has lost about 13 percent this year, almost four times as much as in 2009, the worst full year result on record for the gauge since its 1973 inception.

Yet as the structural support for Treasuries gives way, others have stepped in to pick up the slack, albeit at higher rates. “Households,” a catch-all group that includes US hedge funds, saw the biggest jump in second-quarter Treasury holdings among investor types tracked by the Fed.

Some see good reason for private investors to find Treasuries attractive now, especially given the risk of Fed policy tightening tipping the US into a recession, and with yields at multi-decade highs.

“The market is still trying to evolve and figure out who these new end buyers are going to be,” said Gregory Faranello, head of US rates trading and strategy for AmeriVet Securities. “Ultimately I think it’s going to be domestic accounts, because interest rates are moving to a point where they’re going to be very attractive.”

John Madziyire, a portfolio manager at Vanguard Group, said large pools of excess savings held at US banks earning next to nothing will prompt “people to shift into the short-end of the Treasury market”.

“Valuations are good with the Fed getting closer to the end of its current hiking cycle,” Mr Madziyire said. “The question is whether you are willing to take duration risk now or stay in the front-end until the Fed reaches its policy peak.”

Still, most see the backdrop favouring higher yields and a more turbulent market. A measure of debt-market volatility surged in September to the highest level since the global financial crisis, while a gauge of market depth recently hit the worst level since the onset of the pandemic.

“The Fed and other central banks had for years been the ones suppressing volatility, and now they’re actually the ones creating it,” Mr Capelo said.

With the largest players out of the picture, Treasurys are now in search of another reliable group of buyers for much of that debt. There’s little doubt that the securities will eventually end up in someone’s hands, according to strategist Matthew Hornbach at Morgan Stanley. The bigger question, he says, is what price those securities will then be bought and sold at via marginal players.



Source: Morgan Stanley Research, Federal Reserve, Bloomberg



The absence of major buyers for Treasurys is just another source of worry on the list of concerns plaguing the U.S. government-bond market. The $23.7 trillion Treasurys market, ordinarily the world’s deepest and most liquid fixed-income market, is in fact facing thinning liquidity — which a number of traders, academics, and bond-market gurus say could create a crisis. In addition, the Treasury market’s U.K. counterpart has experienced recent wild selloffs that have led to Bank of England interventions and raised fears of a spillover into U.S. markets.



Read: U.K. Crisis Spills Into U.S. Junk Debt and Opinion: The stock market is in trouble. That’s because the bond market is ‘very close to a crash.’



“A wide variety of actors in the economy purchase US Treasuries. Whether the buyers are commercial banks, asset managers, or US households, the Treasury securities issued by the government will be purchased by someone,” Hornbach wrote in a note Tuesday. The more relevant question for investors at large “is not who will buy the securities, but at what price?”



Falling bond prices translate into higher Treasury yields and, right now, those yields are either above or not far from 4% — levels which haven’t been seen in more than a decade. Theoretically, further declines in bond prices would push yields even higher, denting the appeal of risky assets like stocks, at a time when some market participants have put the idea of an almost 5% fed-funds rate target on the radar. Growing expectations for a 5% fed-funds rate target would likely push Treasury yields toward 5%.



Over the last 30 years or more, the single most important factor that determined the level of Treasury yields — which move in the opposite direction of prices — has been the Fed since its interest-rate policy and forward guidance drives expectations, Hornbach said.



Now that the central bank is hiking interest rates at the fastest pace in decades to contain rampant inflation, it’s also shrinking its balance sheet after putting an end to bond purchases earlier this year — all with the intent of tightening financial conditions.

Meanwhile, foreign investors — led by those in Japan and China, which paved the way for the rest of the world to attain sizable positions in Treasurys from 2001 through 2010 — have been consistently reducing their U.S. government-bond holdings since 2014, according to the Morgan Stanley strategist.



Data provided by Barclays BARC, -0.63% on Tuesday paints a negative picture overall for U.S. fixed-income markets. In sum, it showed that bond funds saw a rise in outflows during the week that ended on Oct. 5, just as foreign custody holdings of Treasurys at the Fed dropped notably for a second week in a row."

Investors flock to US Treasury bonds

Investors appear to be piling in on US Treasury bonds because of their relative safe haven performance in light of the recent macroeconomic crisis. With interest rates rapidly rising, treasury yields have also been appreciating.

Meanwhile, the current state of the economy has not dampened investors’ appetite for trade whatsoever. Tradeweb reported that the trading volume for September was $25.1 trillion, and average daily volume (ADV) increased by 17.2% on the year-on-year metric.

Although the US government bond activity ADV decreased by 3.8% year-on-year to $129.3 billion, this was because of the institutional and wholesale market activity. Among retailers, there was a record volume due to higher interest rates.

In the last quarter, the treasury yields rose from 2.88% to 3.89%. For context, the flagship digital asset Bitcoin (BTC) dropped about 2% of its value, while Ethereum (ETH) gained over 90%, according to CryptoSlate data. The network’s migration to proof-of-stake fueled ETH’s positive price performance.

Meanwhile, the year-on-year performance shows why more people opt for Treasury bonds over BTC and ETH. The ten-year treasury chart showed that yield grew to 3.89% from 1.61% within the past year, while the top two digital assets shed over 60% of their values.

Treasury Direct’s website also has more web traffic than Ethereum.org. The Treasury Direct Quarterly website visits surpassed that of Ethereum on May 29 -as of the end of September, it was 1.8x higher.

Dow Jones is more volatile than BTC

Zerohedge data revealed that the Dow Jones index was more volatile than Bitcoin as of October 07. The Dow Jones index tracks the top 30 industrial stocks.

The Fed finally did it, they broke the market: the dow jones (30 largest industrial stocks on planet earth) is officially more volatile than bitcoin pic.twitter.com/BfveiMYZy2 — zerohedge (@zerohedge) October 7, 2022

This means that Bitcoin’s infamous volatility appears to be cooling down after mirroring stocks’ performance for several months. It also means that the flagship digital asset is maturing and becoming more stable.

Meanwhile, the cooling could be due to the decline in Bitcoin’s value. The asset has traded within the same range for the past three months.

We concluded that foreign central banks were selling and largely responsible for recent poor bond performance. As a result, yields were rising beyond what fundamentals would typically dictate. Per the article: “We suspect that the ECB and BOJ have been selling dollar assets, predominately Treasury bonds, to prop up their currencies.“

As shown below, foreign banks have sold nearly $90 billion in U.S. Treasury securities since June 1, 2022. $80 billion of the sales occurred in just the last four weeks. Foreign banks are likely to raise cash to intervene in the currency markets. Foreign banks must hold U.S. dollars and Treasuries to support foreign trade. Therefore while the trend looks terrible, the downside in aggregate Treasury holdings and bond prices is somewhat limited.

Market Trading Update

As expected, after the end-of-the-week sell-off on Friday, we saw some additional follow-through selling early Monday as investors panic sell into the decline. The “bearish rhetoric” is getting rather extreme, which is usually a good contrarian indicator. Such is particularly the case heading into the Midterm elections, where a deeper market decline won’t bode well for incumbents. This week we also have the September inflation report, which won’t surprise me if it is a little softer than expected, given the early declines in rental and housing prices, and a cooling off in automobile prices. A weaker headline number is “bullish,” although everyone remains focused on the “core” inflation rate. The caps off with retail sales. Weakness in any of these numbers could be seen as bullish by the market, although we will just have to wait and see. Lastly, this week wraps up with the kick-off of earnings season, which will move into high gear starting next week. In other words, there will be a lot of data moving markets through the month’s end.

For now, markets are back to oversold levels with extreme bearishness. While markets could certainly set new lows near term, the odds of a counter-trend rally are once again fairly high. With year-end approaching, there is a LOT of cash needing to be put to work by pensions, mutual funds, and professional managers. Any good news will likely cause a larger upward move than many expect.

Some Dovish Language From Brainard

We have noted recently that the one thing that will move the Fed away from its focus on “inflation” would be a rise in financial instability. Yesterday, Lael Brainard made a statement in this regard that sent stocks rallying off the lows.

“Fed is attentive to risks of further adverse shocks, aware that [market] moves could interact with financial vulnerabilities.”

While she also noted that the “1970s taught [policymakers] that there are risks to easing prematurely,” this was the first more “dovish” line we have seen from the Federal Reserve since it went uber-hawkish following the Jackson Hole summit. With the midterm elections approaching, we may see more of this before November arrives.

Stay tuned.

Sector Correlations Argue for a Rally

The first graph below comes from our internal model, which measures our proprietary technical score for each sector versus the respective excess return versus the S&P 500. We show that the R2 statistical correlation is extremely high at .92. We have learned that markets tend to change trends when the correlation is extremely strong or weak. The second graph highlights in red instances where the R2 was below .10 or above .90. You can see the signal preceded strong moves in the S&P 500 (green).

Earnings on Deck

As we embark on another earnings season, considering the current inflationary environment and the increasing likelihood of a recession is worth considering. Thus far, many companies have successfully passed on higher prices to consumers. Discretionary stocks, for example, as we wrote about in Consumer Staples versus Discretionary, saw the operating margins of its top companies increase by 0.73% last quarter. On the other hand, the top Staples companies saw a decline in margins. Wealthier consumers, able to better withstand higher inflation, helped discretionary companies. Looking ahead, however, lingering inflation may catch up with many of those consumers and, ultimately, the operating margins of discretionary stocks. Per the article:

It’s likely consumers are going to have to make some tough decisions. Consumers are more likely to forgo purchases of discretionary items to help afford needed staples. If that proves true, margins and sales will likely hold up better for staples than discretionary stocks.

History teaches us that as inflation lingers, it becomes harder for companies that weathered the first wave of higher inflation to continue to pass on higher prices. Further, if we are indeed heading for a recession, earnings expectations need to be revised lower. The graph below shows a 20-30% decline in earnings commensurate with prior recessions. The second graph shows that S&P earnings growth is expected to remain slightly positive for the third quarter. It appears the market is off-side in its earnings expectations unless a recession does not occur.

A historically bad patch for U.S. fixed income has been met with dramatic bond fund outflows, starting a year ago in November (see gray area in chart below) when the Federal Reserve began warning that higher interest rates and a smaller balance sheet would be needed to fight high inflation.

Bond funds see worst sustained stretch of outflows since 2013 EPFR, Bloomberg, Barclays Research

The 10-year Treasury yield’s TMUBMUSD10Y, 3.634% surge to above 3.5% has coincided with bond outflows, except for a short stretch this summer when hopes for a Fed policy pivot away from sharply higher rates briefly gripped financial markets.

“The latest flows bring total year-to-date outflows to $67.8bn, after peaking at $82bn in late June — one of the largest bond outflows of the past decade,” Barclays researchers wrote Tuesday.

The exodus through Oct. 5 followed last year’s roughly $350 billion in cumulative inflows to bond funds (see chart), with bank loan, inflation-protected and mortgage-backed bond funds seeing the largest outflows so far in 2022, according to Barclays researchers Samuel Earl and Anshul Pradhan.

Funds flush with 2021 inflows see sharp reversal this year EPFR, Barclays Research

However, with bond yields approaching levels last seen during the 2008 financial crisis, last week also saw inflows to short-term government, long-term corporate and high-yield bond funds, according to the Barclays team.

Yields on the ICE BofA U.S. Corporate Index were pegged at 5.7% to kick of the week, the highest since 2009, but closer to 9% for the high-yield index.

Individuals often gain exposure to corporate bonds through exchange-traded funds. The biggest iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF LQD, +1.22% for highly rated debt was down about 23% on the year through Tuesday, according to FactSet. The large iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF HYG, +1.50% for speculative-grade, or “junk” bonds, was down roughly 18%.

The Fed already has raised its policy rate to a range of 3%-3.25% this year, up from 0%-0.25% a year ago, with another large rate increase expected in November.

U.S. stocks closed mixed Tuesday, with the S&P 500 index SPX, +3.09% off 0.7% and the Dow up 0.1% as investors focused on Thursday’s consumer-price index reading for September, with summer readings showing inflation sticking near a 40-year high.

b15aba1e-e11a-48cd-9a51-54d17abd83c7,"Wall Street added to its recent string of losses Monday, as stocks fell ahead of a busy week of inflation updates and the start of corporate earnings reporting season.

The S&P 500 fell 0.7%, extending its losing streak to a fourth day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.3% after wavering between small gains and losses, and the Nasdaq composite fell 1%. The Dow and Nasdaq have also closed lower the past four trading days.

Small company stocks also fell, dragging the Russell 2000 index 0.6% lower. U.S. bond trading was closed.

Major indexes are coming off a volatile week where they notched out gains because of an early two-day rally that shielded stocks from several weak days.

Wall Street has been turbulent amid worries about stubbornly hot inflation and the Federal Reserve’s plan to tame high prices by raising interest rates. The goal is to slow economic growth and cool both borrowing and spending in order to get inflation under control, but the plan risks sending the economy into a recession.

Investors will potentially get a more detailed picture of the Fed’s thinking on Wednesday when the central bank releases minutes from its latest policy meeting. That’s when the Fed made another extra-big interest rate increase of three-quarters of a percentage point.

“Nobody’s arguing about whether inflation is falling, it’s simply the slope of the slide,” said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds. “The inflation battle is being won and the problem is the recession battle may be getting lost unnecessarily.”

Wall Street will also get important updates on inflation and more insight into how that is impacting retail sales.

The government on Wednesday will release its report on producer prices, which will provide details for inflation on the wholesale level for businesses. The closely watched report on consumer prices will be released on Thursday and a report on retail sales will be released on Friday.

The latest sales update could confirm that consumers are increasingly stretched financially, or at least pulling back on spending. That could send a signal to the Fed, Kelly said.

“I’m just hoping the Fed is watching these indicators,” he said. “It should tell them they’re much closer to both beating inflation and killing the economy than they think they are.”

Uncertainty about how the economy will weather future Fed rate hikes has helped keep trading choppy on Wall Street. The major indexes were all briefly in the green Monday, before ending up in the red by the end of the day.

Technology stocks were the biggest weights on the market. Makers of semiconductors and chip manufacturing equipment also suffered heavy selling after the U.S. government tightened export controls to limit China’s ability to get advanced computing chips, develop and maintain supercomputers, and make advanced semiconductors. Nvidia fell 3.4%.

Energy stocks fell as the price of U.S. crude oil dropped 1.6%. Occidental Petroleum slid 5.6%.

Health care stocks also helped pull the S&P 500 lower. Pfizer lost 1.4%.

Industrial companies and others considered less risky, such as household goods makers, held up better than the rest of the market.

A busy week of closely watched economic reports comes amid the opening to the latest round of corporate earnings reports. Those reports, and statements from companies and corporate executives, could help provide a clearer picture of how high prices are impacting revenue and profits and the expectations for the rest of the year and even into 2023.

Stocks fell in Hong Kong and Shanghai on news of more lockdowns in China due to rising COVID-19 cases. Markets in Tokyo were closed for a holiday.

Casino and resort operators with operations in China slumped over worries about the impact from more lockdowns. Wynn Resorts fell 12.2% for the biggest decline among S&P 500 companies and Las Vegas Sands slid 7.6%.

New York CNN Business —

September’s hotly anticipated jobs data ended up cooling markets on Friday. Stocks fell sharply as investors evaluated the report, which showed more jobs than expected were added to the US economy and indicated that more pain-inflicting interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve lie ahead.

But a breakdown of the numbers shows that the Fed’s plans to weaken the labor market to fight persistent inflation may already be working, just not for everybody.

White-collar office workers appear to be feeling the brunt of the Fed’s actions: The financial and business sector saw a large decline in employment last month. Legal and advertising services also experienced drops. Service and construction workers, meanwhile, are still thriving.

What’s happening: The US economy added 263,000 jobs in September, higher than analyst estimates of 250,000. The unemployment rate came in at 3.5%, down from 3.7% in August.

Leading the gain in jobs was the leisure and hospitality industry, which added 83,000 jobs in September — and employment in food services and drinking places made up 60,000 of those jobs alone. Manufacturing and construction also came in hot, adding 22,000 and 19,000 jobs, respectively.

The largest non-governmental losses in jobs came from the financial industry, which shed 8,000 between August and September. Large banks hire in cycles, extending offers to recent graduates in the early fall months. That makes this September’s drop particularly significant.

Business support services — such as telemarketing, accounting and administrative and clerical jobs — are also bleeding jobs. The sector lost 12,000 in September. Meanwhile, legal services lost 5,000 jobs, and advertising services also dropped 5,000 jobs.

What it means: The Federal Reserve’s hawkish policy appears to be cooling certain parts of the economy, but not others. Finance workers are likely beginning to worry as their industry depends on stock and lending markets which have been particularly hard hit by Fed actions.

Friday’s numbers indicate that we’re beginning to see that impact in the employment data.

What remains to be seen is whether the Fed can cool the economy just by loosening employment in white-collar industries or if these losses will trickle down to other industries, hurting lower-income workers.

Coming up: Earnings season begins in earnest this week with big banks like JPMorgan, Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS) and BlackRock (BLK) reporting. Investors will be watching closely for any guidance on hiring and layoff plans.

Two key inflation indicators, PPI and CPI are also set to be released. Expect markets to react poorly if inflation comes in hot.

Bad news ahead

A panel of top US economists just released its economic outlook for the next year, and it’s not great.

The panel of 45 forecasters, led by the National Association for Business Economics (NABE), said they expected slower growth, higher inflation, higher interest rates, and weakening employment in both 2022 and 2023 than they previously expected.

Most of the worries come down to the Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy.

“More than three-quarters of respondents believe the odds are 50-50 or less that the economy will achieve a ‘soft landing’,” said NABE Vice President Julia Coronado. “More than half the panelists indicate that the greatest downside risk to the U.S. economic outlook is too much monetary tightness.”

NABE panelists downgraded their median forecast for real GDP for the fourth quarter of 2022 to a 0.1% increase, compared to a 1.8% increase in the May 2022 survey. The vast majority of respondents placed more than a 25% probability of a recession occurring in 2023, with the most likely start date in the first quarter.

The latest report comes as a growing number of economists are predicting that recession is imminent. Former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers told CNN on Thursday that it’s “more likely than not” the US will enter a recession, calling it a consequence of the “excesses the economy has been through.”

A return to the office

Friday’s jobs report showed that the share of workers telecommuting or working from home because of the pandemic ticked lower — falling to just 5.2% in September from 6.5% in August.

Fully remote work in the United States, which many predicted would remain the norm long after the pandemic, appears to be edging away, especially as the job market loosens for white collar workers and employees have less leverage.

Last week, a KPMG survey of US-based CEOs found that two-thirds believed in-office work would be the norm within the next three years.

Still, it may not be enough to help an ailing commercial real estate market, where the outlook is dire. New York City office properties declined by nearly 45% in value in 2020 and are forecast to remain 39% below their pre-pandemic levels long-term as hybrid policies continue, according to a recent study from the National Bureau of Economic Research.

Looking forward: The Bureau of Labor Statistics has noted that while hybrid work may still be popular, Covid-19 is no longer fueling work from home trends. The October report will rephrase its telework questions to remove references to the pandemic.

Since May 2020, each jobs report has asked: “At any time in the last four weeks, did you telework or work at home for pay because of the Coronavirus pandemic?”

In May 2020, 35.4% answered yes.

Starting next month, the question will be revised. “At any time in the last week did you telework or work at home for pay?” it will ask, limiting the timeline and eliminating any reference to the pandemic.

Up next

The US bond market is closed for Columbus Day/Indigenous Peoples’ Day.

Coming later this week:

▸ Third quarter earnings season begins. Expect reports from big banks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS), PNC (PNC) and US Bancorp (USB) and consumer staples like Pepsi (PEP), Walgreen (WBA)s and Domino’s (DMPZF).

▸ CPI and PPI, two closely watched measures of inflation in the US are also due to be released."

The Federal Reserve’s fight to squash inflation will cause the US economy to start losing tens of thousands of jobs a month beginning early next year, Bank of America warns.

Although the jobs market remained surprisingly strong in September, the Fed is working hard to change that by aggressively raising interest rates to ease demand for everything from cars and homes to appliances.

The pace of job growth is expected to be roughly cut in half during the fourth quarter of this year, Bank of America told clients in a report Friday.

As pressure from the Fed’s war on inflation builds, nonfarm payrolls will begin shrinking early next year, translating to a loss of about 175,000 jobs a month during the first quarter, the bank said. Charts published by Bank of America suggest job losses will continue through much of 2023.

“The premise is a harder landing rather than a softer one,” Michael Gapen, head of US economics at Bank of America, told CNN in a phone interview Monday.

In a perfect world, the Fed would slow the jobs market enough to get inflation back to healthy levels, but not so much that it causes significant and persistent job losses. Bank of America doesn’t think the Fed will be able to pull that off.

“We are looking for a recession to begin in the first half of next year,” Gapen said.

Unemployment to peak at 5.5%, Bank of America says

Last Friday’s jobs report showed that although the jobs market is slowing down, the United States added a stronger-than-expected 263,000 jobs in September. The unemployment rate dropped to 3.5%, tied for the lowest level since 1969.

But Gapen expects the unemployment rate will climb to around 5% or 5.5% over the next year. By comparison, the Fed expects the unemployment rate to hit 4.4% next year.

The US central bank is raising interest rates at the fastest pace in at least four decades in a bid to cool inflation. Fed officials have made clear they are in no rush to shift out of inflation-fighting mode to save the economy from a slowdown or even a recession.

“They’ll accept some weakness in labor markets in order to bring inflation down,” Gapen said.

Fed officials have said interest rates will need to stay at “restrictive” levels for a period of time.

Gapen said that although recessions tend to have “quick snapbacks,” the Fed’s stance on keeping rates high for an extended period suggests “maybe this plays out a little longer.”

“We could see six months of weakness in the labor market,” he said.

‘Mild’ recession

Some forecasters are more bullish on the state of the jobs market. The Conference Board said Monday its employment trend index, a combination of leading job market indicators, ticked up last month.

The Conference Board said this is a signal that “employment will continue to grow over the coming months,” though job gains are likely to “decelerate from their recent pace.”

The good news is that even those calling for a recession don’t see the unemployment rate skyrocketing as it did in 2020 or 2008.

Bank of America expects the unemployment rate will top out at 5.5% next year, well below the peak of nearly 15% in April 2020.

“Although nobody wants to be callous about someone losing their job,” Gapen said, “this could be classified as a mild recession.”"

So much for a sleepy Columbus Day on Wall Street. Stocks weren’t doing much Monday morning but took a turn lower in the afternoon following stark comments from JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who warned that the United States is likely to enter a recession within the next six to nine months.

Dimon made the comments in an exclusive interview with CNBC that aired Monday.

“You can’t talk about the economy without talking about stuff in the future…and this is serious stuff,” Dimon said in the CNBC interview. He added that he thinks Europe is in a recession already and that the US is probably next.

The Dow fell more than 200 points shortly after Dimon’s comments aired before rebounding to end the trading day down nearly 95 points, or 0.3%.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq were each down sharply midday but also bounced off their lows. The S&P 500 closed with a 0.8% loss while the Nasdaq dropped 1%.

Shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which is one of the 30 stocks in the Dow, were down nearly 1%. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is one of several big banks that will report earnings on Friday.

Stocks have tumbled this year due to worries about inflation and how the Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest rate hikes to fight surging prices may eventually lead to a recession. Stocks soared early last week, leading to hopes that the market had bottomed.

But sellers have returned with a vengeance in the past few days. Friday’s mostly solid jobs report did little to dispel fears about more big rate hikes from the Fed.

The Nasdaq hit a new 52-week low Monday. The Dow and S&P 500 are not far from their lows either. The Dow is down about 20% this year and is back in a bear market along with the other two major market indexes.

The bond market was closed Monday, but yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury are currently hovering around 3.89%. The 10-year yield, which heavily influences the direction of mortgage rates, briefly topped 4% late last month and hit its highest level since October 2008.

Fed vice chair Lael Brainard alluded to challenges in the housing market in a speech Monday. Brainard noted that “the moderation in demand due to monetary policy tightening is only partly realized so far” and that “the transmission of tighter policy is most evident in highly interest-sensitive sectors like housing.”

Brainard also warned that “in other sectors, lags in transmission mean that policy actions to date will have their full effect on activity in coming quarters.” In other words, the rest of the economy could soon slow."
069507ad-6533-4001-8835-9aa862cb1f09,"Companies that provide equipment, labor and technology for oil and gas drilling continue to add workers, but employment in the oil-field services sector remains well below pre-pandemic levels.

In September, employment in oil-field services and equipment ticked up nationwide to 640,767, according to preliminary federal data analyzed by the Energy Workforce and Technology Council. The industry trade group estimates that, after August adjustments, the sector added 2,566 jobs in the U.S. last month.

Like the overall U.S. economy, the oil field services industry is still adding jobs, but the pace is slowing. Nationwide, the sector was adding about 5,000 jobs a month until reporting about half that number in September. Also, like other businesses in the country, oil-field services firms have been hit with supply chain issues making it hard to get equipment, and when they are able to secure needed resources, they’re paying more because of inflation.

Oil-field services companies, however, are expected to benefit from this year’s high oil and gas prices. While supply chain issues and exiting Russian operations after the war in Ukraine cost companies millions, Houston-based Halliburton still posted more than $100 million in profits in the second quarter, and Paris-based Schlumberger recorded $959 million. Analysts expect similar results when third-quarter results roll in this month.

While the sector, which also includes Houston-based Baker Hughes and Weatherford, has seen more activity this year, employment is still about 65,000 jobs below that of February 2020, the month before the pandemic brought drilling to a near standstill.

RELATED: OPEC's production cut could mean higher gasoline prices, bigger oil profits and new headaches for Democrats

Texas is home to nearly half of those jobs. In September, the council estimated Texas oil field services employment at 312,246 – a 3,970 dip from August’s preliminary numbers, but still well above the 287,000 Texas had at the start of the year. Both September and August data are subject to adjustments.

“As the energy services sector continues to rebuild the workforce from pandemic losses, the September increases are encouraging in the face of lower job increases across the country,” said Leslie Beyer, Energy Workforce and Technology Council CEO, in a statement.

The oil and gas industry as a whole has reported record-breaking profits amid soaring demand after the pandemic and an energy crunch brought on by the war in Ukraine.

Most recently, the move by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies to limit production has sent the price of West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, back above $90 per barrel."

The unemployment rate among Hispanic workers dropped sharply in September, but that could be due to fewer eligible adults looking for a job. Hispanic workers saw their unemployment rate fall to 3.8% from 4.5% in August. Broken down by gender, unemployment declined to 3.2% among Hispanic males over 20 years old and 3.6% among females. The decline is much bigger than the one seen at the country level. The government said the overall jobless rate fell to 3.5% from 3.7% in August, its lowest level since July. A total of 263,000 jobs were created last month, less than a Dow Jones forecast of 275,000.

But Hispanics saw a sharp decline in labor force participation, which tracks how many people are employed or searching for work. It fell to 66.1% from 66.8% in August, indicating fewer individuals are finding employment or searching for work as the employment-to-population ratio tracking the proportion of the population employed dipped to 63.5%. ""That decline from 4.5% in August to 3.8%, while really significant, has to be tempered by the fact that clearly, Latinx workers withdrew from the workforce,"" said Michelle Holder, a distinguished senior fellow at Washington Center for Equitable Growth. Many Hispanic workers do seek employment in some areas of the market heavily affected by Federal Reserve interest rate hikes, she added. Lea este artículo en español aquí. While Hispanic workers saw the biggest declines on a month-to-month basis, she noted that Black women have still seen the sharpest decline in labor force participation since the start of the pandemic. While the decline in participation is a reason for concern, areas of the labor market where Hispanic workers are overrepresented did experience significant gains in September, noted William Spriggs, chief economist of the AFL-CIO. Those sectors included leisure and hospitality and construction where payrolls were up 83,000 and 19,000, respectively. But those numbers don't come without their downsides, he said. ""This is disturbing because it means Hispanic workers are finding great difficulty moving out of their pockets and the big story of this recovery has been the success of women and Black workers to move out of the trap of just being in low-wage industries,"" he said."
f09ee7c1-cc77-4141-a834-003eda4a1f46,"The decision, which sent crude oil prices sharply higher, means central banks now face an even tougher task in tackling inflationary pressures.

Market optimism was further pummelled on Friday, with the release of a robust US jobs report for September which saw the US unemployment rate dip to 3.5 per cent last month, down from 3.7 per cent in August.

Investors quickly concluded the strength of the US jobs market means the Fed will stick with its plans for yet another outsize 75 basis point rate rise at its November meeting, followed by a 50 percentage point rise in December.

This would take the Fed’s policy rate to a range of 4.25 per cent to 4.5 per cent, from the present level of between 3 per cent to 3.25 per cent.

And the expectation of aggressive rate hikes was reinforced by a succession of Fed officials who emphasised the need for aggressive rate hikes given that inflationary pressures are stubbornly high and broad-based.

Fed officials fear that tight labour markets will maintain upward pressure on wages, which will reinforce price pressures, particularly in the labour-intensive services sector.

Central bankers feel an urgency to tame inflation which has been unusually high for the past 18 months.

Initially, central bankers were sanguine about the jump in inflation, believing it would be relatively easy to control if it temporarily exceeded their targets.

After all, for the past decade central bankers in most developed countries have struggled to kindle price pressures and to reach their inflation targets.

The dearth of inflationary pressures left central bankers open to accusations that they’d been too quick to tighten monetary policy following the financial crisis.

Now, however, central bankers are worried that they’re at risk of repeating the mistakes of the 1970s, when long-lasting inflation starts to affect consumer and business behaviour.

The fear is that inflation will become even more entrenched and more difficult to tame if workers begin to negotiate higher wages because they expect inflation to remain elevated, while companies adjust to these higher costs by hiking prices more frequently.

To prevent this insidious inflationary psychology from taking hold, central bankers are now prepared to err on the side of raising rates too far, even though highly leveraged borrowers are now feeling the pain from falling asset prices."

I try to do a grateful meditation session every night, which was especially fitting this past Thanksgiving weekend, but I must admit it has been a difficult year for money managers and investors to be grateful since the selloff in both bonds and stocks has made it one of the worst on record.

This is a time when it is most important to have a process and not deviate from it despite all the negativity, because there are some very encouraging signs of what lies ahead if you look close enough.

“If you think every bear market leads to a global crisis, you’re going to have awful long-term returns and a ton of anxiety on top of it,” Michael Batnick, managing partner at Ritholtz Wealth Management LLC, said in a recent piece, Was that the Bottom?

For example, who knows what will happen in the near term, especially if seasonality plays out or the United States Federal Reserve capitulates, thereby motivating some of that mountain of cash on the sidelines into the market.

Over the past 20 years, the S&P 500 has gained, on average, 4.1 per cent during the fourth quarter, according to Barchart, while the MSCI has only declined three times during that same period.

Barchart also points out that the composite sentiment indicator created by Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. is now so negative that a buy signal has formed. The indicator’s buy signal has preceded positive returns over the next four weeks more than 70 per cent of the time since 2000.

According to Batnick, as of Sept. 30, “less than 85 per cent of stocks in the S&P 500 were above their 200-day moving average. This has happened 219 times since 1987, with most of these periods clustered together: 1987, 2002, 2008, etc. The only time returns weren’t positive one year later was September 2001 (-13 per cent), and October 2008 (-six per cent). That’s it.”

The big question is what the catalyst will be? We continue to think it still comes down to the Fed capitulating on its aggressive tightening stance. The good news is that some of the core factors it watches with regards to inflationary pressures are showing signs of improvement.

Story continues

Housing is one of them, and U.S. apartment demand “has unexpectedly evaporated in much of the country due to what appears to be a freeze in new household formation,” Jay Parsons, head of economics at RealPage Inc., said. Net absorption in Q3 was negative for the first time in 30 years.

It is just a matter of time before residential housing pricing decelerates, even under a hike-and-hold scenario, since the current situation is not sustainable. If you could afford to make a 20-per-cent down payment and pay US$2,500 per month, you could purchase a US$750,000 house before the rate hikes, according to Michael McDonough, chief economist, Financial Products, at Bloomberg. Today, that US$2,500 payment gets you a US$476,000 house.

Another key factor is the jobs market and that’s weakening as well. “Job openings could come down significantly — and they need to — without as much of an increase in unemployment as has happened in earlier historical episodes,” Fed chair Jerome Powell said on Sept. 22.

In this regard, the recent U.S. JOLTS report showed that more than a million job openings were canceled in August, a 10 per cent drop from the 11.17 million reported in July. It was also the biggest one-month decline since April 2020 in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Finally, there is the rocketing U.S. dollar, which has been a global wrecking ball thanks to a mismatch in the Fed’s stance against other central banks whose economies are in a much weaker position and unable to keep pace with rate hikes.

At the end of September, we calculate the U.S Dollar Index was up almost 22.5 per cent over the past 12 months, with most of the gains starting in April. The Canadian dollar fell nine per cent, the Australian dollar 12 per cent, the euro 17.5 per cent and the pound 21.5 per cent over the same period.

Even the United Nations is calling on the Fed to pause its rate hikes, warning that further policy tightening risks a global economic downturn.

Put all this together and we think we are getting close to the lows. There always remain tail-risk events, but the probabilities point to a win for those betting on the house rather than persistently against it.

It can be impossible to get the timing right, since market bottoms are a process, but at least there is finally a light at the end of what has been a dark tunnel this year. This, I can be grateful for.

Wall Street firms have begun publishing their 2023 forecasts for the S&P 500.

Targets published by seven top equity strategists range from 3,800 to 4,200, implying returns of 4% to 15% from current levels.

We’ll only know how accurate these calls are in hindsight. We do, however, know that last year’s 2022 forecasts have proven very inaccurate so far.

As of Dec. 5, 2021, 14 strategists followed by TKer.co had 2022 year-end S&P 500 targets ranging from 4,400 to 5,300. At the time, the implied one-year returns ranged from -3% to +17%.

There’s a lot to be said about making these short-term forecasts.

One thing is that they often gravitate around a midpoint expectation for about 8% to 10% returns.

And why not? Historically, the average annual return on the S&P is about 8% to 10%.

Unfortunately, 8% to 10% returns aren’t as common as you might think.

Check out these two charts published last week from A Wealth of Common Sense. They chart the annual returns of the S&P 500 since 1977.

S&P 500 Annual Returns

S&P 500 Annual Returns 2000-2022

As you can see, 8% to 10% returns are not common at all. This is an important truth about the stock market.

The 8% to 10% average comes from many years of outsized returns, many years of weak or negative returns, and a few years of average returns.

On this matter, I often think about this quote legendary investor Peter Lynch gave at a speech on October 7, 1994:

Some event will come out of left field, and the market will go down, or the market will go up. Volatility will occur. Markets will continue to have these ups and downs… Basic corporate profits have grown about 8% a year historically. So, corporate profits double about every nine years. The stock market ought to double about every nine years… The next 500 points, the next 600 points — I don’t know which way they’ll go. So, the market ought to double in the next eight or nine years. They’ll double again in eight or nine years after that. Because profits go up 8% a year, and stocks will follow. That's all there is to it.

Story continues

When he says “the market,” Lynch is referring the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which closed at 3,797 on the day he gave the talk. If you compound that by an 8% growth rate over 28 years, which would get you to present day, then you get 32,757. The Dow closed Monday at 29,203, which is pretty darn close.

If you did this exercise with the S&P 500, which closed at 455 on the day of Lynch’s talk, then you’d get 3,925 assuming an 8% compound annual growth rate. The S&P closed Monday at 3,612.

Again, if you look at the charts above, you don’t see many years with 8% returns. But over time, you get an average return of nearly 8%.

While your long-term investment plan may assume average returns in the stock market, it certainly shouldn’t assume average returns every year.

Stocks surged 5.7% on Monday and Tuesday and then shed almost all of those gains on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. When it was all said and done, the S&P 500 closed at 3,639.66, up a modest 1.5% from its Sept. 30 close of 3,585.62, which was the lowest closing price of 2022. The index is now down 24.1% from its January 3 closing high of 4,796.56.

There’s a lot to be said about what’s moving markets. (You can begin to understand what’s going on by reading this and this.)

One thing is clear: None of Wall Street’s most prominent stock market strategists saw this year’s sell-off coming.

Total employment is continues to grow. (Source: BLS via FRED)

As of Dec. 5, 2021, 14 strategists followed by TKer had 2022 year-end S&P 500 targets ranging from 4,400 to 5,300. At the time, the implied one-year returns ranged from -3% to +17%.

It speaks to the difficulty of accurately predicting short-term returns in the market when some of the most experienced, well-resourced professionals are this far off.

With that in mind, a handful of strategists have already communicated to clients where they expect the S&P 500 to head in 2023. Here’s a roundup:

Capital Economics: 3,800 (as of 10/7/22)

Morgan Stanley: 3,900* , $219 EPS (as of 10/3/22) *This is a June 2023 target.

Citi: 3,900 , $215 EPS (as of 10/3/22 via Investing.com)

HSBC: 4,000 , $225 EPS (as of 10/4/22)

Goldman Sachs: 4,000 , $234 EPS (as of 10/4/22)

Credit Suisse: 4,050 , $230 EPS (as of 10/3/22)

UBS: 4,200, $235 EPS (as of 10/3/22)

Relative to Friday’s closing price, these targets imply returns of 4% to 15% by the end of 2023.

Generally speaking, the strategists expect little to no growth in earnings, on which they apply a P/E multiple in the mid to high teens. Most expect inflation to cool significantly, allowing the Federal Reserve ease up on its hawkish monetary policy stance.

I’ll say two things about one-year price targets.

First, most of the equity strategists TKer follows produce incredibly rigorous, high-quality research that reflects a deep understanding of what drives markets. The most valuable things these pros have to offer have little to do with one-year targets. (And in my years of interacting with many of these folks, at least a few of them don’t care for the exercise of publishing one-year targets. They do it because it’s popular with clients.) Don’t dismiss their work just because their one-year target is off the mark.

Story continues

Second, don’t obsess over these one-year targets. Here’s what I wrote last December:

⚠️ It’s incredibly difficult to predict with any accuracy where the stock market will be in a year. In addition to the countless number of variables to consider, there are also the totally unpredictable developments that occur along the way.Strategists will often revise their targets as new information comes in. In fact, some of the numbers you see above represent revisions from prior forecasts.For most of y’all, it’s probably ill-advised to overhaul your entire investment strategy based on a one-year stock market forecast.Nevertheless, it can be fun to follow these targets. It helps you get a sense of the various Wall Street firm’s level of bullishness or bearishness.

Anyway, I look forward to publishing a more comprehensive list of 2023 forecasts later this year.

PS: For more on all this, my friend Eric Soda of the Spilled Coffee newsletter has a roundup of what some legendary investors had to say about short-term forecasting. Check it out here.

Reviewing the macro crosscurrents 🔀

There were a few notable data points from last week to consider:

💼 Job gains continue. U.S. employers added a healthy 263,000 jobs in September, according to BLS data released Friday. Total employment as measured by payrolls stood at 153.018 million, which is above the pre-pandemic high of 152.504 million in February 2020.

🥶 … but job growth is decelerating. The 263k jobs added reflect the lowest monthly gain since April 2021, confirming that the labor market is cooling.

💸 Wages climb. Average hourly earnings climbed by 0.31% in September, up from 0.28% in August but down from 0.50% in July.

👍 Unemployment remains low. The unemployment rate fell to 3.5% in September from 3.7% in August. You have to go back to June 1969 to find a lower unemployment rate.

👍Unemployment claims remain low. Initial claims for unemployment benefits rose to 219,000 during the week ending Oct. 1, up from 190,000 the week prior. While the number is up from its six-decade low of 166,000 in March, it remains near levels seen during periods of economic expansion.

👍 Layoff activity remains low. According to BLS data released Tuesday, the layoff rate (i.e., layoffs as a percentage of total employment) ticked up ever so slightly to 1.0% in August from 0.9% in July.

📉 Job openings are falling. According to the same BLS report, U.S. employers had 10.05 million job openings listed in August. This is down from 11.17 million job openings in July, and the change represents the largest monthly drop since April 2020.

🤔 Immigrant labor is still depressed. From Bloomberg: “Immigration to the US is rebounding after a sharp two-year slowdown, but the pickup is unlikely to plug the pandemic-induced gap in new arrivals amid persistent employee shortages in industries reliant on foreigners.“

💸 Changing jobs gets you a bigger raise. However, this trend is cooling. From ADP: “Job changers, who have been notching double-digit, year-over-year gains since the summer of 2021, lost momentum in September. Their annual pay rose 15.7%, down from a revised 16.2% gain in August. It's the biggest deceleration in the three-year history of our data. For job stayers, annual pay rose 7.8% in September from a year ago, up from a revised 7.7% in August.“

🔨 Manufacturing activity cools. According to the ISM’s Manufacturing PMI, manufacturing activity grew in September but at a decelerating rate.

S&P Global’s Manufacturing PMI ticked up marginally in September. But the report notes that “even with the latest improvement, the weakness of the data in recent months still point to manufacturing acting as a drag on the economy in the third quarter...“

🤷🏻 Service sector surveys are mixed. According to the ISM’s Services PMI, service sector activity growth decelerated slightly in September. Nevertheless, the industry is growing at a healthy clip according to this survey.

Services activity growth cools. (Source: ISM)

S&P Global’s Services PMI, however, reflected contraction in the industry in September, though at a less severe rate than August.

💡 Manufacturing surveys confirm a tight labor market. From S&P Global: “…firms expanded their workforce numbers at the fastest pace since March, although labor shortages continued to hamper firms' ability to work through incoming new orders.“ From ISM’s Tim Fiore: “Markedly absent from panelists’ comments was any large-scale mentioning of layoffs; this indicates companies are confident of near-term demand, so primary goals are managing medium-term head counts and supply chain inventories.“

💡 Services surveys also confirm a tight labor market. From S&P Global’s Chris Williamson: “With companies also reporting staffing issues and rising wages due to very tight labor market conditions, persistent inflation remains a concern at the same time that the economy appears to be struggling to regain momentum.” From ISM’s Anthony Nieves: “Employment continued to improve despite the restricted labor market.“

⛓ Supply chains improve. The New York Fed’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index1 — a composite of various supply chain indicators — fell for the fifth consecutive month in September to its lowest level since November 2020, meaning supply chains are easing.

📈 Inventory levels are up. Wholesale inventories jumped 1.3% in August, bringing the inventory/sales ratio to 1.31.

🚗 Used car prices are down. From Manheim Consulting: “Wholesale used-vehicle prices (on a mix, mileage, and seasonally adjusted basis) decreased 3.0% in September from August. The Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index declined to 204.5 and is now down 0.1% from a year ago.“

📈 Mortgage rates are high. According to Freddie Mac, the average 20-year fixed rate mortgage is 6.66%.

🏚 Mortgage payments are high. According to Bloomberg’s Michael McDonough, a $1,000 monthly payment on a 30-year mortgage with a 5% down payment gets you just $160k worth of house.

Mortgage costs are very high. (Source: @M_McDonough)

🏠 Home seller are cutting prices. From Redfin: “On average, 7.7% of homes for sale each week had a price drop, a record high, up from 3.9% a year earlier.“

Listed home prices are coming down. (Source: Redfin)

🏘 The supply of homes for sale is up. From Redfin: “Months of supply—a measure of the balance between supply and demand, calculated by dividing the number of active listings by closed sales—increased to 3.0 months, the highest level since July 2020.“

Homebuyers have more options. (Source: Redfin)

🍼 People are planning to have kids. From BofA: “The percentage of respondents expecting a New Baby over the next 12-months remains near all-time highs both sequentially and y/y (Exhibit 1). We continue to watch for a Millennial Baby Boom as pregnancy test unit sales also remain elevated...”

Putting it all together 🤔

Supply chains continue to ease and inventory levels continue to rise. While some of this can be attributable to the economy cooling, the bottom line is that these are positive developments for bringing down inflation.

Job growth is cooling and job openings are falling, something the Federal Reserve has been hoping for in its effort to get inflation under control by cooling wage growth. Still, the labor market is also quite robust as the unemployment rate and layoff rate are near record lows — another thing the Fed has been hoping for in its effort to cool the labor market without causing too many people to lose their jobs.

While there are many signs that prices in the economy are easing, aggregate measures of inflation remain very high.

So prepare for things to cool further given that the Fed is clearly resolute in its fight to get inflation under control. Recession risks will continue to intensify and analysts will continue trimming their forecasts for earnings. For now, all of this makes for a conundrum for the stock market and the economy until we get “compelling evidence” that inflation is indeed under control.

The good news is there’s still a strong case to be made that any downturn won’t turn into economic calamity. Furthermore, the long-run outlook for stocks continues to be positive.

Opinion columnist

The news that Elon Musk wants to go forward with the purchase of Twitter has led to a virtual panic among media, political and academic figures worried that free speech could shortly break out on the social media platform. Former Politico magazine editor Garrett Graff summed up the collective vapors succinctly: “Be afraid, be actually afraid.”

I sincerely hope so.

While Musk had in recent months wavered on his purchase, he said last week that he wants to move forward with a $44 billion offer to buy the social media platform. On Thursday, the judge presiding over Twitter's lawsuit against Musk for backing out of the original deal gave the world's richest person until Oct. 28 to reach an agreement on the purchase.

Censorship culture threatens to limit free speech

The free speech community hopes that Musk is still committed to his stated commitment to return free speech protections to the social media giant. In the past 10 years, a censorship culture has not only become deeply embedded at Twitter but also on other social media platforms. The need for censored and limited speech has become an article of faith for many on the left.

Opinions in your inbox: Get exclusive access to our columnists and the best of our columns every day

I have long admitted to being an ""internet originalist,"" someone who viewed the internet as the greatest development for free speech since the invention of the printing press. However, the rapid erosion of free speech values – from our Congress to our campuses – has been alarming.

Led by President Joe Biden, Democratic leaders and media figures have demanded corporate censorship and even state censorship to curtail opposing views on issues ranging from climate change to election integrity to public health to gender identity. The Washington Post’s Max Boot, for example, declared, “For democracy to survive, we need more content moderation, not less.”

Now these same figures are fearful of the supposed menace that Musk poses – the prospect that a major social media platform could actually restore free speech protections.

It would reverse the anti-free speech policies of Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal, who has pledged to regulate content as “reflective of things that we believe lead to a healthier public conversation.”

Agrawal said the company would “focus less on thinking about free speech” because “speech is easy on the internet. Most people can speak. Where our role is particularly emphasized is who can be heard.”

Agrawal's policy of ""who can be heard"" offers a reverse model for how to develop a new culture at Twitter. Indeed, his emphasis on the limits of the First Amendment is precisely where Musk should start.

Religious freedom: Is Supreme Court pro-religion? That's over simplistic and confusing.

I have argued for a ""First Amendment approach"" for social media companies. While the companies are not legally subject to the First Amendment, they can voluntarily adopt for themselves the same limitations the government faces.

The First Amendment was never intended to be the exclusive definition of free speech. It deals with only one source of limiting free speech – the government. Yet, many of us view free speech as a human right worthy of protection by private companies. We hope Musk does as well.

Twitter could adopt First Amendment standards

Musk could flip the script of those who justify corporate censorship by declaring that the company will follow the same limitations and standards applied to the government on free speech. In other words, if the government could not censor a tweet, Twitter would not do so.

Voluntary adoption of First Amendment standards would get Twitter largely out of the censorship business. The company would have a ready-made list of cases on the scope of permissible speech controls, with a heavy preference for free speech over speech regulation.

Musk would need to take other steps to exorcise a censorship culture at Twitter. One priority should be to order employees to preserve all records of communications with political leaders and organizations. There is growing evidence of backchannels between social media companies and the government and certain groups.

First Amendment heads to Supreme Court:State tramples our First Amendment rights as Christian artists. We're fighting back.

Musk also could help answer questions of how political figures have used the company for ""censorship by surrogate"" in past years. That should include whether the company has retaliated against critics, especially conservatives, by withholding blue check marks that help to validate an account's worth or by using other methods to depress the profile of certain accounts.

The panic evident among media and political figures reflects the fact that, if Musk is serious about free speech, the system of corporate censorship might collapse. With a free speech option in the market, many users are likely to return to Twitter. They are less likely to remain on sites like Facebook, where censorship is not only rampant but also the subject of a campaign to get people to embrace what the company euphemistically calls ""content modification.""

Earlier this year, when Musk first appeared likely to buy Twitter, leading advocates for corporate censorship like Hillary Clinton turned to good old-fashioned state censorship. Clinton called upon Europe to pass laws that could force Musk to censor views or face punitive fines. She pushed countries to act ""before it's too late.""

A committee in the British Parliament seemed to answer Clinton's call by asking Musk to appear for questioning.

Recently, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern received gushing praise when she spoke to the United Nations and called for a system of global censorship. Ardern is the smiling, cheerful face of modern censorship.

She revealed how sweeping such a system would likely be and defended the need for censorship to combat those who question climate change and to stop “hateful and dangerous rhetoric and ideology.”

She left out that governments would determine what ideas or dissenting views are too dangerous to allow.

Euronews correspondent Shona Murray recently tweeted, “The end of Twitter as we know it is nigh.” If we are lucky, that is precisely what Musk will bring about.

Musk has already earned a place in history for his accomplishments in an array of fields, from transportation to space. However, restoring free speech to social media would rank as his greatest gift to humanity. It would not be ""Twitter as we know it,"" and that would be a great thing.

862db0fa-50c7-4b0d-8859-c5426d2e6a8d,"You’ve probably read about how such big hitters as Carl Icahn’s Icahn Enterprises, Dan Loeb’s Third Point and D.E. Shaw cleaned up when Elon Musk did a shocking about-face, and agreed to purchase Twitter at his original bid. But as a case study in why purchasing Twitter stock after Musk tried to exit and the shares tanked presented a such great arbitrage opportunity, it’s fascinating to study the reasoning of the two money managers who virtually wagered their small fund on the deal’s outcome, and won big time. Ryan Ballentine and Evan Tindell met in the early 2000s at MIT, where Ballentine captained the hockey and lacrosse teams, and Tindell captained tennis as a three-time All-American. Tindell even tried his hand at professional poker before the pair aimed at goals and aces playing stocks by starting Bireme Capital in 2016.

Bireme manages a portfolio in the $50 million range, mainly for individual investors, but Ballentine and Tindell give the ball a special spin by running it as a hedge fund. They specialize in finding situations where “cognitive biases” cause a stock to sell either well above or far below its fundamental value. Cognitive bias is a term from behavioral finance, the discipline positing that investors frequently make irrational decisions for reasons of comfort, habit or emotion.

One of Bireme’s big positions is a short on shares of Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy, the enterprise software player that’s strapped its fortunes to Bitcoin by packing $3 billion in the crypto leader on its balance sheet. Ballentine and Tindell reason that its shareholders way over-value MicroStrategy based on its market cap’s premium over the market value of its Bitcoin. They also observes Saylor’s flamboyant salesmanship has tricked investors into vastly overpaying for the stock. In behavioral economics, it’s what’s called “the bandwagon effect,” where the more people who keep praising a stock or product, the more people get captivated by the growing excitement and join the herd. As Ballentine put it, “We like situations where people push a stock much too high or much too low for non-economic reasons, anticipating that the economic reasons always win.”

Why the Twitter drama was a clear case of mis-pricing

Ballentine and Tindell first bought Twitter when Musk posted his infamous “deal on hold” tweet on May 13. Until that date, Twitter was selling at a modest discount to Musk’s $54.20 or $44 billion offer. But over the next four trading days, its shares cratered from $47 to $37 as Wall Street saw a high probability the deal wouldn’t happen. As investor pessimism grew, Bireme bought more. Ballentine and Tindell re-loaded in early July after Musk’s letter to Twitter’s board pulling the offer sent shares to $33, and made their final purchases in late July after Musk filed counterclaims that in their view, revealed no new facts to strengthen his case. Although they decline to specify their holdings, Ballentine disclosed that the buys totaled well above $10 million, and that their investors have reaped “several million” in gains at Twitter’s price of roughly $51 at mid-morning on October 6.

For the pair, the doubts that drove Twitter’s shares into the mid-to-low $30s didn’t come close to matching the real odds the deal would close at the original price. “It was ‘cognitive bias’ in spades,” says Ballentine. “It was all about the glaring light and deafening noise around the transaction, and not about rational analysis.” What misled investors, he says, was Musk’s image as a winner, and his vaunted reputation for escaping trouble. “People looked at Musk, this genius in the public eye, as someone who told the SEC to buzz off and got away with tiny fines,” says Ballentine. “They looked at his history, and saw a big public face who always got his way. People assumed that would be the case in this dispute.”

Ballentine and Tindell based their conviction that Twitter would beat the world’s richest man on tangible evidence, the record of the Delaware courts in requiring buyers to honor purchase contracts and close on mergers. “People who thought Musk would win didn’t understand the Delaware Court of Chancery and how these cases are adjudicated,” says Ballentine. “The franchise of the Delaware courts is that they demand that contracts be enforced. Musk couldn’t tell the court to go away the way he summarily ignored the SEC. Being a scofflaw wouldn’t work in Delaware.”

Musk insists that Twitter was hiding its practice of allowing millions of “bots” and spam accounts on its platform. He argued that the multitudes of fake customers undermined its value so severely that they constituted a Material Adverse Effect that empowered him to scrap the deal. But Ballentine and Tindell didn’t think Musk’s claims remotely proved an MAE. “If you look a the case law, you see that only once has a buyer been able to break a deal via an MAE, and that was Musk’s principal position,” notes Ballentine. “His evidence for a real MAE was severely lacking.”

Ballentine emphasizes that in the sole instance where the Chancery Court allowed an MAE, the facts looked nothing like the Twitter case. In April of 2017, German pharmaceutical manufacturer Fresenius agreed to purchase Illinois drugmaker Akorn for $4.5 billion. In the months that followed, Fresenius discovered that Akorn had fabricated data to the FDA and committed fraud in failing to reveal its perilous financial condition. Akorn’s started booking big losses; in effect, Fresenius was buying an empty shell portrayed by Akorn management as a thriving manufacturer. Fresensius sued to quash the merger, alleging an MAE. In a blockbuster decision the following year, the Chancery Court opened the exit ramp for the first and only time in its history, and Akorn soon declared bankruptcy. It was clear to Ballentine and Tindell as the Twitter-Musk case unfolded that Twitter wasn’t hiding its true financial condition at all, and that Musk chances of proving an MAE, given the practically lethal damage the buyer had to show in the Akorn case, were nil.

On the issue of bots, the testimony of the whistleblower, former chief security officer Peiter Zatco, proved a fizzle according to the Bireme partners. “He was actually helpful to Twitter’s case,” says Ballentine. “He acknowledged that Twitter knowingly allows bot and spam accounts, but said that they remove them from the numbers that matter. That’s the count of mDAUs or monetizable daily users that drive advertising dollars.” A more plausible, but sill minor threat was the whistleblower’s account of multiple security lapses. “They sounded serious, but the main point is that they couldn’t possibly add up to a MAE that would kill the transaction,” recalls Ballentine. “The biggest fine of all time for information security practices was the $5 billion imposed on Facebook, a much bigger company than Twitter. A permanent destruction of value of over 20% triggered the MAE in the Akorn case. An impairment of that size would have meant that security problems hammered Twitter’s value by $12 billion, an implausibly large number.”

Well before Musk’s stunning reversal, Twitter’s shares rose well into the mid-$40s, far above Bireme’s purchase price. “As we expected, what happened over time is that people got news of the Chancery Court’s practically uniform record of enforcing merger contracts,” says Ballentine. “Law professors assessed the odds the deal would close at near the original price, and they mostly put the chances as overwhelmingly high. The rulings in the case were all in Twitter’s favor, it was obvious that the judge had a low opinion of Musk’s case.”

Possible reasons why Musk changed his mind

Though Musk faced a likely loss at trial, Ballentine was surprised by his sudden shift from demanding a full exit to, in all probability, paying a full price. “I thought since he’d gone this far that though he didn’t think he’d win, he’d go through with the trial hoping something would fall into his lap,” says Ballentine. “He clearly didn’t want to be deposed. He’d already used a lame excuse to delay a deposition for a week.” Ballentine reckons that a deposition could unearth a number of facts that could kill Musk’s case, and sully his reputation. “Musk used encrypted ‘signal’ messages in communicating with his family office,” says Ballentine. “He says he didn’t use them to talk about Twitter, but what if he didn’t disclose or destroyed signal messages about the deal? He’d also have to answer questions on whether he’d tried to scuttle the financing in a bad faith effort to terminate the transaction.”

As of October 6, Twitter was selling at $51, a nearly 6% discount to the contract price of $54. Ballentine and Tindell sold a portion of their shares, but still hold the majority on the conviction that Musk will close at the contract number. Still, Ballentine acknowledges that for that to happen, Twitter needs far stronger assurances from the Musk camp. “There’s lots of bad blood between the two parties,” he says. “Twitter regards Musk as untrustworthy. To make sure the deal happens, it will need to keep the trial scheduled until it received ironclad guarantees. One would be Musk’s putting tens of billions of dollars in escrow. Another would be for Musk to agree to an order of “specific performance” outside of a trial, meaning he would assume an adverse outcome from a trial. That agreement would would leave him no avenue to back out.”

The possibility the lenders will bail, scuttling a deal

“The lenders desperately want out of this deal,” says Tindell. He notes that interest rates have risen sharply since they committed to low-cost financing months ago, meaning they’d face big underwriting losses, and that the deterioration in Twitter’s business makes it a credit risk. Technically, Musk could escape from the deal if the creditors depart. But the contract stipulates that they can only walk if Twitter is insolvent, and its condition is far from that dire. Plus, evidence that Musk has prodded lenders wouldn’t fly with the Judge, Kathaleen McCormick, who in a previous case forced a buyer to perform after it conspired to kill its financing as a way out. “The banks appear locked in, but even if they somehow managed to escape and it were proven that Musk pushed them, the court could demand that he close by substituting his own billions for the loans,” says Tindell. He and Ballentine also agree that walking would tarnish the lenders’ reputations. “Their customers want to see the lenders they know and trust follow through on deals they committed to, and not wriggle out,” says Tindell.

How does Ballentine, who’s been closely watching Musk’s machinations in the Twitter saga, think he’ll fare as its owner? “He’ll find running a social media empire a lot harder than he expects,” predicts Ballentine. “It’s one thing to send rockets to the moon, but another to deal with messy social and political issues of Twitter. He’s a tech expert, not a social or political expert.” Not to mention that he’s overpaying by billions and dragging close friends along with him in what appears to be one of the worst deals in modern memory."
f87ff1c6-da91-48f9-9408-c8c752f20c47,"An ex-Twitter employee who left amid Elon Musk's takeover bid spoke to Insider.

They said it felt like layoffs were imminent and teams tried to pivot.

They said many of their former colleagues didn't feel safe in their jobs.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with a former Twitter employee who left during Elon Musk's bid to purchase the company. They wished to remain anonymous to speak freely about their situation. Their identity is known to Insider. This essay has been edited for length and clarity.

I worked at Twitter from early 2021 until earlier this year on the moderation team. There was a night-and-day change after the company first announced Elon Musk's offer to buy the company for $44 billion in April.

It felt like everything halted. The company stopped backfilling roles. It limited hiring, which put huge pressure on teams. There were people who left after the Musk move because of the environment it created. It was very stressful.

There were a lot of Twitter executives saying the changes weren't just Musk-based, and the company was in financial trouble anyway — which may be why it agreed to the deal.

You could even see scaleback in the kind of office perks that draw people to tech companies. The food wasn't as good as it had been or there wasn't as wide a range of snacks as there was before. It was a really weird degradation. I think removing the perks was an attempt to filter out people they thought already wanted to leave.

I've previously worked in companies when layoffs were happening, and it felt very similar to that

It affected work patterns for a lot of teams. People on my team worried that they needed to show their work was valuable to save their jobs and their team. Our manager told us that attrition was what the company wanted. [Editor's note: Twitter did not respond to Insider's request for comment.]

Lots of people were having mental-health challenges during the time. It wasn't just that working on stuff for Twitter is tricky or that big companies are high-pressure environments. It was just unpleasant to be doing that amount of work under those uncertain circumstances.

The company canceled projects quickly and streamlined everything. You had to start quantifying the impact of your work very clearly. Even if you supported Musk taking over, it had a clear effect on the company employees couldn't ignore.

There wasn't a huge change in terms of the company's policies in anticipation of Elon Musk taking over. There are people at Twitter who are still pro-moderation — the stuff that Musk supposedly stands against.

But there was a worry that content moderation might go, and very soon. That gave people an uncertainty that didn't motivate them. You have to know your work will mean something in a few years' time to have that motivation. And to have that great question mark over the top didn't help.

I left partway through the takeover, months after Musk announced he wanted to take charge

The takeover felt inevitable, and I didn't trust Parag as a leader and the decisions he was making. The fact he was the figurehead of the board in this process didn't really give me a sense that there was a future.

I joined Twitter to learn about and improve their processes for handling misleading information and moderation, and it felt like that wouldn't be a priority under Musk.

I read his texts over the weekend. It seems like there'll be very quick changes that are core to the company. It seems to me that he wants to buy the Twitter name, then completely gut and change it.

There's also the political angle to this. If his stance is going to be protecting free speech, and it means that you can't moderate anything or that no one is going to get blocked, then it feels like he's going to have a difficult time going up against these online safety and moderation bills and laws that are coming up around the world.

I was speaking to some former colleagues, and they think the deal will go ahead

I always thought it would. It's quite funny — I was happy he was trying to back out, but it felt somewhat inevitable that the board would push it through.

From the start they were pushing this. While Elon Musk can try and buy as many companies as he wants, or back out of as many deals as he can, the board permitted this to go through. That was never a great feeling.

Speaking to people there, nobody feels safe in their job. I just don't understand how it's going to work as a company. There's a mad attempt to restructure in some places to save face. It feels like the perfect time to try and get out — or prepare yourself for what's going to happen."
9b7c893c-e1bb-4f4c-8979-7d840835c0e9,"Elon Musk wants Twitter again — and Twitter is game. The billionaire Tesla CEO has proposed to buy the company at the originally agreed-on price of $44 billion, bringing the tumultuous, monthslong saga another step closer to a conclusion.

Musk made the surprising turnaround not on Twitter, as has been his custom, but in a letter to Twitter that the company disclosed in a filing Tuesday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

READ MORE: What 3 experts think about Elon Musk buying Twitter

It came less than two weeks before a trial between the two parties over Musk’s attempt to back out of the deal is scheduled to start in Delaware. Musk also faced a scheduled deposition by Twitter attorneys starting Thursday.

In response, Twitter said it intends to close the transaction at $54.20 per share after receiving the letter from Musk. But the company stopped short of saying it’s dropping its lawsuit against the billionaire Tesla CEO. Experts said that makes sense given the contentious relationship and lack of trust between the two parties.

“I don’t think Twitter will give up its trial date on just Musk’s word — it’s going to need more certainty about closing,” said Andrew Jennings, professor at Brooklyn Law School, noting that the company may also be worried about Musk’s proposal being a delay tactic. After all, he’s already tried to unsuccessfully postpone the trial twice.

Trading in Twitter’s stock, which had been halted for much of the day pending release of the news, resumed trading late Tuesday and soared 22% to close at $52.

But even if the deal now goes through without a hitch, it’s too soon to call a victory for Twitter, said Jasmine Enberg, an analyst with Insider Intelligence.

“The deal will solve some of the short-term uncertainty at the company, but Twitter is essentially in the same place it was in April,” she said. “There is still plenty of uncertainty around what Musk intends to do with Twitter, as well as the future of a company with a leader who has wavered in his commitment to buying it. And if we’ve learned anything from this saga, it’s that Musk is unpredictable and that it isn’t over yet.”

Musk’s proposal is the latest twist in a high-profile saga involving the world’s richest man and one of the most influential social media platforms. Much of the drama has played out on Twitter itself, with Musk — who has more than 100 million followers — lamenting that the company was failing to live up to its potential as a platform for free speech and had too many bots.

While some logistical and legal hurdles remain, Musk could be in charge of Twitter in a matter of days — however long it takes him and his co-investors to line up the cash, said Ann Lipton, an associate law professor at Tulane University.

A letter from Musk’s lawyer dated Monday and disclosed by Twitter in a securities filing said Musk would close the merger signed in April, provided that the Delaware Chancery Court “enter an immediate stay” of Twitter’s lawsuit against him and adjourn the trial scheduled to start Oct. 17.

Attorneys for Musk did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday.

READ MORE: Twitter has a misinformation problem. Here’s how Elon Musk’s plans for the platform could make it worse

Musk has been trying to back out of the deal for several months after signing on to buy the San Francisco company in April. Shareholders have already approved the sale, and legal experts say Musk faced a huge challenge to defend against Twitter’s lawsuit, which was filed in July.

Eric Talley, a law professor at Columbia University said he’s not surprised by Musk’s turnaround.

“On the legal merits, his case didn’t look that strong,” Talley said. “It kind of seemed like a pretty simple buyer’s remorse case.”

Musk claimed that Twitter under-counted the number of fake accounts on its platform, and Twitter sued when Musk announced the deal was off.

Musk’s argument largely rested on the allegation that Twitter misrepresented how it measures the magnitude of “spam bot” accounts that are useless to advertisers. Most legal experts believe he faced an uphill battle to convince Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick, the court’s head judge, that something changed since the April merger agreement that justifies terminating the deal.

Musk remained mum about the turn of events on Twitter until late Tuesday afternoon, when he tweeted that “Buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app” without further explanation.

HANOI, Oct 8 (Reuters) - A Vietnamese real estate tycoon was arrested on suspicion of financial fraud, the police said on Saturday, as the country broadens its years-long anti-graft drive.

Truong My Lan, chairwoman of Ho Chi Minh City-based Van Thinh Phat Holdings Group, was accused of illegally issuing bonds to raise trillions of dong (tens of millions of dollars) from investors during the 2018-2019 period, the Ministry of Public Security said in a news release on Saturday.

""Further investigation is underway to clarify the frauds,"" the ministry said.

Lan's company did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.

Vietnam recently broadened its anti-graft drive with a series of high-profile corporate arrests, including top stockbrokers, property developers and even regulators.

Three others accused of involvement in Lan's case were also arrested, the police-run ministry said on Saturday.

The ministry said on Friday there had been irregularities in Van Thinh Phat Holdings' acquisition of several state-owned land slots at prime locations in downtown Ho Chi Minh City.

Rumours about the imminent arrest of Lan earlier on social media this week had triggered a run on Saigon Joint Stock Commercial Bank (SCB) over suspicions of ties between Lan and the bank.

Vietnam's central bank on Saturday reassured depositors at SCB and said it was monitoring the situation there.

""The State Bank of Vietnam affirmed that it will have solutions and policies in accordance with the law to ensure the rights and interests of depositors, maintain the stability of SCB in particular and the system of credit institutions in general,"" the central bank said in a statement.

SCB said in a statement on Saturday that Lan did not hold any managerial or executive post at the bank and her arrest did not affect its operations.

""SCB pledges to have sufficient measures and resources to ensure its depositors' rights and interests as well as the rights and interests of its partners and clients,"" the bank said in the statement.

“Front-loading was a good thing, given how far below neutral rates were. But overshooting is costly too, and there is great uncertainty about how restrictive policy must actually become,” Evans said Monday in remarks prepared for a speech at a National Association for Business Economics conference in Chicago.

“This puts a premium on the strategy of getting to a place where policy can plan to rest and evaluate data and developments.”

The Chicago Fed chief pointed to recent projections published by the U.S. central bank that showed officials expected to raise their benchmark federal funds rate to just above 4.5% next year, from the current target range of 3% to 3.25%. The Fed has been raising rates rapidly since March, when the federal funds rate was nearly zero, in a bid to curb the highest inflation in four decades.

Hold and Observe

“I see the nominal funds rate rising to a bit above 4.5% early next year and then remaining at this level for some time while we assess how our policy adjustments are affecting the economy,” Evans said.

The projections, published at the conclusion of the central bank’s Sept. 20–21 policy meeting, also showed officials expected the unemployment rate would need to rise to 4.4% by the end of next year in order to bring inflation down, according to the median policymaker’s estimate.

A monthly Labor Department report published Oct. 7 showed the unemployment rate fell to 3.5% in September amid strong job creation. Evans said he thought the Fed could boost unemployment and “bring inflation down relatively quickly while also avoiding a recession.”

Evans pointed to the so-called Phillips curve, which plots the historical relationship between unemployment and inflation, in making his case. In the years before the pandemic, the relationship was weak, but supply-chain problems since then may have strengthened it, he said.

“Extra supply-chain interactions were not an issue when the unemployment rate was around the same low level in 2019, and so we saw less of an inflationary impact from tight labor markets back then,” Evans said.

“If this steeper-than-usual Phillips curve is generating much of the higher inflation we are seeing now, then we should also expect this steeper curve to help bring inflation down relatively quickly with only moderate increases in unemployment. Steep on the way up is steep on the way down.”"

By Howard Schneider

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Faced with mounting evidence that loose U.S. monetary policy contributed to the breakout of inflation last year, the Federal Reserve now faces the risk it jumped too far the other way with its plans to fight price pressures through continued aggressive interest rate hikes even as the world economy wobbles.

The warning signs of a policy overcorrection have intensified as the U.S. central bank's intent to ""raise and hold"" its benchmark overnight interest rate touched off a global asset repricing - stocks and currencies have fallen and borrowing costs for governments and corporations have risen - that some analysts worry has outpaced the Fed's ability to assess the impact of its policies.

Broad measures of financial conditions have tightened fast in U.S. markets. Economists at Morgan Stanley recently estimated that between inflation and stricter Fed policy, dollar liquidity in the United States, Europe, Japan and China has declined by $4 trillion since March and is falling fast.

The current path ""will lead to intolerable economic and financial stress,"" Michael Wilson, an equity analyst at the investment bank, wrote on Sunday. ""The first question to ask is, when does the U.S. dollar become a U.S. problem"" through global and market impacts that start to influence the American economy and lead Fed officials to reevaluate the pace of their monetary tightening.

The Fed raised interest rates at its Sept. 20-21 policy meeting by three-quarters of a percentage point for the third time in a row, and indicated further large increases were in the offing later this year.

So far, U.S. central bank officials insist nothing in the global marketplace has changed the game plan, even as analysts parse every adverb in policymakers' public remarks for signs that a lighter-touch Fed may emerge at next month's meeting.

This reading of the tea leaves was on display last week when some investors interpreted Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard's reference to ""deliberately"" raising interest rates as a signal the central bank might slow down the pace of tightening.

The shift in monetary policy this year has been the most dramatic in decades, with the Fed's policy rate rising a full 3 percentage points to the current 3.00%-3.25% range. While Fed projections released last month showed officials at the median penciling in another large rate hike at the Nov. 1-2 meeting, the group was closely divided.

NO RUNNING AWAY

In interviews and public statements over the past week, however, Fed policymakers, far from concern over rattled asset markets, have laid out detailed accounts of what they got wrong on inflation over the past two years - including mistakes in their own policymaking - and their intent to fix it.

""Inflation is turning out to be much more persistent than we thought it was going to be,"" Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said on the sidelines of a conference at the regional bank.

The list of culprits is long and includes things, like unexpected changes in people's choices over what to buy and where to work and the surprising inflexibility of U.S. supply chains, over which the Fed has little influence.

But while those developments might have caused relative shifts in prices, Mester and others at the Fed now believe it was the joint evolution of monetary and fiscal policy over the last two years that created the more persistent increase in the underlying price level that the Fed is now trying to arrest.

Pandemic-era fiscal policy was meant to create a ""bridge"" to help households and businesses through the COVID-19 crisis. But the more than $5 trillion in payments, loans and other aid, with new stimulus still being rolled out as late as the spring of 2021, built a world-class surge of cash that fueled purchases of goods and services that the economy strained to provide.

Fed policy, oriented to fight the pandemic and ensure U.S. workers found a pathway back to jobs, remained loose throughout, with low interest rates that were meant to encourage spending in effect until only recently.

Underlying, or ""core"" inflation, became embedded ""because we actually needed to raise our funds rate, or fiscal policy had to adjust to be less accommodative,"" Mester said last week. In the moment ""there was a feeling that policy wasn't too accommodative, because it was a huge pandemic shock ... One thing we learned is the economy is actually much more resilient than people thought it was going to be.""

Acting otherwise would have been difficult.

In March 2021, for example, when President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan was enacted and the last rounds of stimulus checks were being written, the unemployment rate was still 6%, the rollout of coronavirus vaccines was at an early stage, and inflation was only beginning to percolate. By the Fed's preferred measure, inflation was running at an annual pace of 1.7% in February 2021, below the central bank's 2% target.

Though it spiked in March to 2.5% and kept climbing, shifting policy at that point would have put the Fed in direct conflict with fiscal authorities who were still fighting to blunt the economic fallout of the pandemic - an uncomfortable position akin to what Bank of England officials are facing after the government of new British Prime Minister Liz Truss announced major tax cuts.

That would have been an exceptional bit of foresight, taken in an era when uncertainty has ruled and just as Biden's presidency was taking shape.

""How could you not say we called it wrong. I don't run away from that,"" Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said in comments to reporters last week in Virginia. ""The implicit perspective was this was going to be a demand recovery problem. So you got to do everything you can to demand"" with policies to boost consumption and income.

In hindsight, ""how much did we have to actually have to do?""

'MOVED THE NEEDLE'

The Fed now faces a version of the same problem: How long to wait for evidence that inflation, now running at more than three times the central bank's target, is falling before adjusting the pace of rate increases or even the endpoint of the policy rate.

Those concerned about the torrid and insistent pace of Fed rate increases argue that inflation is on the verge of turning, and that continued aggressive rate hikes could push the economy towards higher-than-necessary unemployment - the jobless rate is currently 3.7% - and slower-than-necessary growth.

""They have moved the needle ... I am not sure they need to be as aggressive as they think they need to be,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics and an advocate of the view that much recent inflation can be traced to rising profit margins that he thinks will quickly reverse as demand wanes.

If that proves true, and oil prices don't spike again, a closely watched Fed gauge of inflation could be collapsing next year, Shepherdson estimates.

That's an argument Brainard also mentioned in a recent paper, suggesting that falling profit margins could ""make an important contribution to reduced pricing pressures.""

But the timing is uncertain, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said the ""clock is ticking"" on the central bank to show it can make progress on inflation in order to keep its credibility with markets and the American public.

Even after listing the forces she thought could pull inflation down and mentioning the ""risks associated with overtightening,"" Brainard said the Fed remained singularly focused.

""We have both the capacity and the responsibility to maintain anchored inflation expectations and price stability,"" she said. ""We are in this for as long as it takes to get inflation down.""

WASHINGTON (AP) — More interest rate increases will be necessary to wrestle inflation under control , Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook said Thursday, echoing several tough speeches by other central bank officials this week.

Cook said she has revised her views on inflation in the past several months and now sees it as more persistent. And while real-time, private-sector data is showing signs that inflation could cool in the coming months, the Fed should only slow rate hikes when inflation actually falls, she said.

“With inflation running well above our 2% longer-run goal, restoring price stability likely will require ongoing rate hikes, and then keeping policy restrictive for some time until we are confident that inflation is firmly on the path” back to 2%, she said at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

Cook’s speech, her first as Fed governor, comes after hawkish comments earlier Thursday by Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, and Raphael Bostic, president of the Atlanta Fed, on Wednesday. “Hawks” in Fed-speak typically support higher interest rates to quell inflation, while “doves” are often more focused on keeping rates low to support more hiring.

Their remarks ran counter to speculation among many Wall Street that the Fed may soon slow the pace of its rate increases or even cut rates next year, as the U.S. and world economies struggle with higher energy costs and the threat of recession. The Fed is increasing its benchmark short-term rate at the fastest pace in four decades, causing the U.S. dollar to strengthen sharply against other major currencies. A stronger dollar typically draws more capital to the U.S., disrupting overseas economies.

Yet the comments by Cook, Kashkari, and Bostic suggest the Fed is unlikely to slow its campaign against inflation anytime soon. Fed officials have pushed up their short-term rate by a hefty three-quarters of a percentage point three times in a row, bringing it to a range of 3% to 3.25%, the highest in 14 years.

Fed officials projected last month that they would push rates to roughly 4.4% by the end of this year, and 4.6% by early 2023.

Earlier Thursday, Kashkari acknowledged that because the Fed’s rate hikes take time to work their way through the economy — as long as 12 to 18 months — there is a risk the central bank could raise borrowing costs too high and unnecessarily cause a recession. For that reason, some economists have said the Fed should pause its increases soon and take time to evaluate the impact of its moves on the U.S. and global economies .

But Kashkari, who has shifted from one of the most dovish officials to among the most hawkish, said he was more worried about stopping the rate hikes too soon.

He also said that he, like other Fed officials, had mistakenly thought last year that inflation was temporary and mostly due to supply chain shocks and shortages, only to see inflation persist.

“Until I see some evidence that underlying inflation has solidly peaked and is hopefully headed back down, I’m not ready to declare a pause,” he said at a conference sponsored by the Bremer Financial Corp. “I think we’re quite a ways away from a pause.”

Bostic also delivered hawkish remarks late Wednesday that sought to downplay any chance of rate hikes next year.

“You no doubt are aware of considerable speculation already that the Fed could begin lowering rates in 2023 if economic activity slows and the rate of inflation starts to fall,” Bostic said in a speech at Northwestern University Wednesday.

“I would say: not so fast,” Bostic concluded. “We are still decidedly in the inflationary woods, not out of them.”

In her remarks, Cook said the Fed is aware of slowing growth overseas, which will likely slow U.S. exports.

But she added that the Fed’s goals of stabilizing prices and seeking maximum employment “is a domestic mandate.”"

New York CNN Business —

There’s lots of anxiety swirling about a possible recession. Is Corporate America starting to get nervous, too? We’ll get a better sense this week when several top financial firms and consumer companies report third-quarter earnings.

Asset management giant and iShares owner BlackRock (BLK) is due to report Thursday. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C) and Morgan Stanley (MS) are just a few of the several top banks set to release results on Friday.

Wall Street will also be closely watching earnings earlier in the week from Dow components Walgreens (WBA) and UnitedHealth (UNH), Pepsi (PEP), and Delta (DAL) for clues about the economy.

“This earnings season is going to be a good test to see what management teams say and how much visibility they have” about future sales and profits, said Scott Ellis, portfolio manager at Penn Mutual Asset Management.

These blue chips are not only going to tell Wall Street how they did during the past three months. They are also likely to shed some light on what they expect in the crucial fourth quarter and possibly also give a glimpse at their 2023 outlooks.

Those insights might not be too rosy.

“Assuming there is a recession in 2023, current earnings estimates are likely too high,” said Shawn Snyder, head of investment strategy at Citi U.S. Wealth Management. “That could be the next leg down in the market, but it’s not yet factored in.”

Snyder said it’s possible that earnings could decline 10% next year from 2022 levels. But analysts haven’t slashed their forecasts that drastically just yet. According to estimates from FactSet, Wall Street is still predicting profit growth of nearly 8% next year.

Strong dollar in focus

Major American companies with significant overseas exposure could also get hurt by the relentless rise of the dollar. The robust greenback will hurt sales and profits for these firm’s international operations.

“The most interesting thing to watch for this earnings season is the dollar’s strength. It has had an absolute surge, and that will hurt multinationals,” Snyder said, adding that smaller US companies with less of an international presence may hold up better on the earnings front because currency fluctuations won’t hurt them as much.

Companies with a global sales footprint are starting to feel the pinch already. Jeans maker Levi Strauss (LEVI) blamed “the significant incremental currency headwinds from the stronger U.S. dollar” for its weaker-than-expected earnings outlook last week.

Major multinationals face other headwinds, too. Chip stocks, which already have been hit hard this year due to semiconductor supply chain woes, were dealt another blow last week when Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) warned of slowing sales ahead.

“The PC market weakened significantly in the quarter,” said AMD Chair and CEO Lisa Su in a press release. “While our product portfolio remains very strong, macroeconomic conditions drove lower than expected PC demand.”

Still, there should be some bright spots from this batch of earnings.

The banks should get a continued boost from rising interest rates, which makes lending more profitable. And unlike Europe, where investors are worried about problems at Credit Suisse (CS) and Deutsche Bank (DB), the top US firms don’t appear to be showing signs of financial strain.

“Bank balance sheets and capital positions both remain in solid shape,” said KBW analyst David Konrad in a bank earnings preview report. Konrad has bullish ratings on Goldman Sachs (GS), Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo.

Inflation peaking at last?

Banks may be benefiting from higher interest rates, but most investors (and consumers, of course) are hoping inflation finally begins to cool enough to justify a slowdown in the pace of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.

Whether or not the Fed can start thinking about a pivot will largely depend on the incoming inflation data. The US government will report the latest monthly reads on consumer prices and wholesale prices next week.

The consumer price index, or CPI, is the one investors will be watching most closely. CPI surged 8.3% over the past 12 months through August. Economists are forecasting a slight cooling off for September, to 8.1%.

Wall Street is betting the producer price index, or PPI, will slow as well. Forecasts call for a 8.3% jump in PPI through September, down from an 8.7% annual increase in August.

“Inflation numbers are coming down. There is no doubt about it,” said Michael Sheldon, chief investment officer at RDM Financial Group. Sheldon noted that there have been big drops in commodity prices such as lumber, steel and copper as of late.

One big problem for the Fed is that wages are a big component of the inflation picture — and that number is still historically high, even with wage growth slowing a bit to 5% year-over-year in September.

“Wage growth is not as low as it needs to be for the Fed to take comfort,” said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust.

Sheldon said the Fed would like to see wage growth dip to about 3.5% before it feels that inflation is truly under control.

It’s also not clear just when surging prices will really start to put a major dent in consumer spending. Retail sales surged 9.1% year-over-year in August, a sign that shoppers are holding their noses and continuing to buy despite the sticker shock. The government will report September retail numbers on Friday.

f2d6ab57-c3fa-45b8-91c2-ed1aba6d3d84,"And the end of the week brought two key pieces of good news.

On Thursday night, S & P affirmed the group’s credit rating. While the accompanying report was hardly glowing – “The continued deterioration of global economic conditions and uncertain investor confidence could add to the current pressure on the group’s credit standing if management is unable to quickly demonstrate rapid and material progress against its operational targets,” it read – a source inside Credit Suisse headquarters in Zurich said the leadership team was buoyed by the fact S & P held firm.

Then on Friday night, Credit Suisse created a bit of its own momentum when it announced a tender for its own bonds – the bond equivalent of a share buyback.

Signs of regulatory support

The price of the bank’s bonds had fallen markedly last week, so publicly Credit Suisse presented this as opportunistic liability management – a chance to buy back its own bonds on the cheap.

But given the scrutiny on the bank, this was all about sending a signal to the market.

The most obvious message was that Credit Suisse had the capital and liquidity to buy back $4.7 billion of bonds. In effect, this was the bank saying: “See, we told you the balance sheet was strong.”

But there was a more subtle signal here, too. As is common knowledge in bond markets, a liquidity management event like this doesn’t happen without the approval of regulators. So, no one was in any doubt that the bond buyback had received the nod from on high.

The market bought it – Credit Suisse shares rose 5.4 per cent on Friday night and its bonds rebounded; a €1.5 billion, 1.5 per cent bond due in 2026 that is part of the buyback rose in price, pushing its yields down from above 6 per cent on Thursday to 5.475 per cent. Credit default swap spreads also narrowed markedly.

Whether this turns out to be a sugar hit or a turning point remains to be seen. Credit Suisse insiders openly acknowledge they had borrowed from the playbook of Deutsche Bank, which also bought back its own bonds in 2016 to help calm investors.

Deutsche Bank enjoyed a similar bounce initially, but the crisis swirling around that bank resumed about a month later and by 2017 it was raising capital, having promised not to do so.

Koerner will be hoping his buyback at least keeps markets calm until he can unveil his grand plan – which is likely to involve asset sales, job losses and massive restructuring.

But if that plan disappoints, the wolves will be back at Credit Suisse’s door."
4a5bbbe6-003f-486c-89de-708cdde3a782,"Hang Seng Index plunges to below 17,000 points as Beijing vows to stick with the controversial pandemic strategy.

Hong Kong’s stock market has plummeted to its lowest level in more than 10 years after China doubled down on its punishing dynamic “zero COVID” pandemic strategy.

The Hang Seng Index on Tuesday plunged to below 17,000 points for the first time in 11 years, as Beijing tightened COVID curbs and reiterated warnings against any relaxation in the fight against the coronavirus.

Beijing’s doubling down on “zero COVID” comes as concerns over China’s economy are already elevated due to the United States’ crackdown on Chinese tech firms, rising interest rates globally, and domestic challenges, including a deflating property bubble.

Chinese tech shares had on Monday tumbled as much as 20 percent after US President Joe Biden announced new rules requiring firms to obtain a licence to sell advanced computing semiconductors to China.

“It’s connected to several things all going on at once – the zero COVID policy in China, worsening economic data from the mainland, rising interest rates globally, the Ukraine war, the property crisis on the mainland and now the Biden administration cutting off China from most advanced US semiconductor technology, which is sending chip stocks in Hong Kong, China and around the world plunging,” Peter Lewis, a former investment banker and host at Radio Television Hong Kong, told Al Jazeera.

Cities including Shanghai, Shenzhen, Xian and Fenang have ramped up testing and rolled out new restrictions, including neighbourhood lockdowns and school closures, to stamp out cases before a key Chinese Communist Party Congress that begins on Sunday.

In an editorial on Tuesday, the People’s Daily reiterated the need to stick to “zero COVID”, a day after calling on the public to have “confidence and patience” in spite of mounting economic damage due to stringent pandemic controls.

China’s economy is expected to grow just 2.8 percent in 2022, compared with the Asia-Pacific average of 5.3 percent, according to the World Bank.

Despite the tightening curbs, China’s nationwide COVID tally on Monday surpassed 2,000 cases, the highest in nearly two months.

Carlos Casanova, senior economist for Asia at UBP in Hong Kong, said policymakers had limited options to prop up the subdued investor sentiment at present.

“State funds typically step in to support Chinese onshore equities ahead of such events,” Casanova told Al Jazeera. “However, this time round will be different, as state funds have been busy stabilising the Chinese yuan against expectations of a stronger dollar into the year-end.”"

I learned quickly that the impact of financial stress is both devastating and far-reaching. It coloured every aspect of a person’s life, from their wellbeing, to their relationships, and career.

Finances are a huge stressor for many, and if you want to make mental health a priority, alleviating some of the anxiety surrounding money management is a good place to start. 42% of U.S adults say money is negatively impacting their mental health, according to a recent survey from Bankrate and Psych Central. The survey polled 2,457 adults about how finances affect their mental state. Feeling stressed is the top response to finances, according to 70% of survey respondents. Other emotions people associate with money include worry, anxiety, feeling overwhelmed and insecurity. These are the money-related activities that triggered negative feelings, from most to least common: Looking at their bank accounts (49%)

Paying a bill (41%)

Making a purchase (34%)

Having to discuss money (32%)

Getting paid (21%)

Looking at their investment accounts (16%)

Looking at social media (11%)

These groups are most affected by money-related stress

Of all age groups, millennials, aged 26 to 41 years old, experienced the most financial anxiety, at 48%. ""That's when we're first having children, first starting out or are insecure around our jobs because we haven't done it long enough. We haven't built up savings,"" says T.J. Williams, a regional president and financial advisor at Wealth Enhancement Group, an independent wealth management firm. ""Those are normal experiences that we've had for generations, but society's put a different spin on it. Social media's put a lot of pressure that's undue."" Gen X, ages 42 to 57, doesn't lag far behind at 46%, and 40% of those aged 18 to 25 in Gen Z say money problems cause mental health concerns for them, too. Women, more than men, indicate that money significantly impacts their mental state, ""with 46 percent selecting it compared to 38 percent of men."" When income is factored in, low earners experience more emotional distress due to finances than higher earners. Just 30% of people who make at least $100,000 annually say money negatively affects their mental health, compared to 48% of earners making less than $50,000 a year.

3 ways to feel financially secure, maintain positive mental health"
e7a6f9e7-5927-4a42-95db-cfb34262d9c2,"Feeling stressed about budgeting, finances, and the perpetual talk surrounding inflation and an upcoming recession is not novel. Financial stress—including the mental health impact of managing a tight budget amid an uncertain economic climate—is experienced by the vast majority of Americans, although the coping responses and priorities differ by generation, a new survey finds.

In a financial wellness survey released Monday conducted by Robinhood, a financial services company that surveyed 2,200 Americans in August aged 18 to 57, 84% reported feeling stressed about money. High-income earners report being financially stressed (80%) only marginally less than low-income Americans (85%). These feelings can worsen as the holidays approach, which is a major financial burden for over a third of Americans compared to other times of year. Younger generations in particular fear for their future.

The financial stress centered around planning for the future arises in almost half of Gen Z (45%) and millennials (41%), and buying a house and car independently financially stress out almost half of Gen Z in particular. Over a third of both Gen Z and millennials report not contributing to their 401K due to the economic climate, and nearly one-third of millennials say they have a drink in response to this stress.

Still, people have largely taken action to combat these feelings directly. Almost half of those surveyed from all generations have created or edited a budget to combat their overwhelm—and 81% of all those surveyed report eating out less to manage inflation.

It’s common to spend on happiness

Despite the almost universal feelings of financial stress, almost half of Americans are not letting one spending influencer go by the wayside: their happiness.

Forty-nine percent of Americans frequently or sometimes get into financial trouble by spending on their happiness, with those finding the most joy from spending on shopping or hobbies. Spending to improve happiness resonates across generations, although it’s more common for Gen Z (64%) and millennials (68%) than Gen X (57%).

Story continues

Spending on so-called happiness should not be something we eliminate altogether, says Amanda Clayman, a psychotherapist specializing in financial therapy, in Robinhood’s press release. Incorporating the things you love, and even the hobby that may help you cope with that financial stress, into your budget is a way to control the spending, she says.

""Putting things you actually care about into your spending plan can be a transformational act,"" says Clayman, in a statement to Fortune.

Not treating yourself to the potentially small expense that may improve your overall happiness and well-being in the long run is not the answer, Dr. Dennis P. Stolle, the senior director of applied psychology at the American Psychological Association, told Fortune.

Set behavioral goals

Instead of coping in potentially harmful ways to drown the stress, take action by managing your budget and improving your financial literacy. Feeling the uncertain stress about money is common, and ways to combat it can start with setting “behavioral goals,” Clayman says in the release, including challenging yourself to read about personal finance routinely in your week or starting to invest small amounts of money at a time as a way to take control of your situation and feel confident about your future.

Leaning on a trusted individual can also help build that confidence, she says. The survey reveals that people would feel comfortable seeking help: 64% of millennials say they would go to a financial therapist if they had the means.

“Some of us react to situations by rebelling and refusing to acknowledge restraints, perhaps by spending beyond our means, but others use constraints as an impetus to act,” Clayman says in the release.

Acknowledging your feelings is the first step, which can help turn fear into action, knowing that you’re accompanied by countless others who have similar stressors.

""The key here is to accept that our feelings have a purpose and a function, and to look for ways to experience them without needing to shut down [or] run away,"" Clayman says.

WASHINGTON, DC (DC News Now) — Nearly half of American adults report mental health struggles related to personal finances, according to a recently published survey.

As mental health struggles continue to garner mainstream attention, people struggling to pay bills, make rent and more are feeling the pinch.

Bankrate found 42% of adults in the U.S. said money is impacting their mental health negatively. One in three men, and one in four women are estimated to be hindered by the issue.

The survey found that millennials and people making less than $50,000 annually are primarily burdened.

Among the top issues found by the survey:

Not having enough savings for emergencies

Affording daily expenses

Debt

Not having enough money for discretionary spending

“It’s really around life transitions and ‘Will my financial situation support my mission, in terms of where it is that I’m trying to go?'” said Dr. Lorenzo Norris, a psychiatrist at George Washington University.

Economists point to small investments for big payoffs. Those include reviewing monthly earnings and expenses, considering putting aside amounts for a cash reserve and making a plan to pay down debt. For future opportunities to apply for loans, paying bills on time will help maintain a healthy credit score.

People facing a bill that needs to be paid immediately can utilize “cash advance” apps such as Earnin and Dave — short-term loan service providers that offer up to hundreds of dollars, and with low fees.

For those that cannot afford therapy or other coping mechanisms, Norris advised consumers to “acknowledge it [the financial burden]. You take a couple deep breaths. You pay it. You get with your plan. That’s your box, it’s not going anywhere. Then, you can disengage, and then you can move on to more positive things.”

If you find yourself experiencing struggles with mental health, it’s recommended that you talk to your doctor about treatment options.

Any belief that the Federal Reserve will shift to a softer stance towards monetary policy was extinguished on Friday by data that showed unemployment fell in September, signalling a labour market that is not suffering from red-hot inflation.

The dollar held firm against a basket of currencies, while a number of market-based measures of investor risk nervousness showed another increase.

Russian missile strikes during Monday's rush hour across Ukraine killed at least five people in the capital Kyiv, in apparent revenge bombings after President Vladimir Putin declared an explosion on the bridge to Crimea to be a terrorist attack.

""I had wondered if markets were looking at the situation in Ukraine and thinking this was moving us toward an end - which was what the first reaction was to the progress that the Ukrainian army had made in the summer. That reaction is no longer happening and this is clearly seen as just an increase in tension, rather than the end of anything,"" Societe Generale head of currency strategy Kit Juckes said.

""We've got geopolitical tensions and we're still on track towards tighter monetary policy in the States and the concern is still by the time they finished tightening, will they have tightened too much and leave the economy looking pretty vulnerable?,"" he added.

The MSCI All-World index fell 0.5 per cent in early trading in Europe, down for a fourth consecutive day. The pan-European STOXX 600 fell 0.5 per cent to its lowest in a week, while Germany's DAX lost 0.1 per cent and the FTSE 100 fell 0.7 per cent, making it one of the weaker performing indices.

S&P 500 futures fell 0.5 per cent, while those on the Nasdaq lost 0.6 per cent.

Wall Street sank on Friday after an upbeat payrolls report cemented expectations for another large rate hike.

Futures imply a more than 80 per cent chance of rates rising by 75 basis points next month, while the European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to match that and the Bank of England to hike by at least 100 basis points.

US consumer inflation is expected to have moderated to an annual 8.1 per cent, but the core measure is forecast to have accelerated to 6.5 per cent from 6.3 per cent. The US CPI data is due on Thursday.

""We are in the midst of the largest and most synchronised tightening of global monetary policy in more than three decades,"" said Bruce Kasman head of economic research at JPMorgan, who expects hikes of 75 basis points from all three of the central banks.

""The September CPI report should show a moderation in goods prices that is a likely harbinger of a broader slowing in core inflation,"" he said.

""But the Fed will not be responsive to a whisper of inflation moderation as long as labour markets shout tightness.""

Minutes of the Fed's last policy meeting are also out this week and are likely to sound hawkish given how many policy makers lifted their dot plot forecasts for rates.

Although US inflation and the Fed's response to it remain front and centre of investors' minds, euro zone government bonds got a boost from the pickup in investor risk aversion.

German 10-year Bund yields, which serve as the region's benchmark, eased 3.0 basis points to 2.162 per cent, while the more sensitive two-year Schatz fell 8.0 bps to 1.787 per cent.

Adding another note of caution was 2.0 per cent drop in Chinese blue-chip stocks, following a survey that showed the first contraction in services activity in four months.

Corporate earnings also kick off on Friday, with JPMorgan, Citi, Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley reporting results.

""Consensus expects 3.0 per cent year/year EPS growth, 13 per cent sales growth, and 75 bp margin contraction to 11.8 per cent,"" analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a note. ""Excluding Energy, EPS is expected to fall by 3.0 per cent and margins to contract by 132 bp.""

""We expect smaller positive surprises in 3Q compared with 1H 2022 and negative revisions to 4Q and 2023 consensus estimates.""

The dollar index rose 0.3 per cent to 113.14, leaving the euro down 0.4 per cent at $US0.9697 ($A1.5271) and the yen flat at 145.45, a whisker away from the recent 24-year high of 145.90 that prompted Japanese intervention.

Sterling lost 0.3 per cent to $US1.10625 ($A1.7421), after the Bank of England announced a surprise decision to shore up the gilt market ahead of the end of an emergency bond-buying program on Friday.

Oil fell for the first time in a week, as investors took profit on last week's 11 per cent rally after a deal on supply reductions by OPEC+.

Brent fell 0.7 per cent to $US97.26 ($A153.17) a barrel, while US crude dropped 0.6 per cent to $US92.08 ($A145.01) a barrel."
47930360-c515-4460-bd14-4cb1584e6116,"Zachary Bogue, co-managing partner for DCVC, speaks during the Future of Innovation: Spotlight on Artificial Intelligence Conference in San Francisco, California, U.S., on Thursday, June 22, 2017. The market for AI technologies is estimated to generate more than $60 billion in productivity improvements for U.S. businesses annually.

The Silicon Valley venture capital firm DCVC invests in all kinds of climate tech companies including geothermal power, aerial methane imaging, advanced nuclear fission reactors, fabrics made out of mycelium, wastewater filtration technology — to name a few.

But there is one category of the climate tech landscape that Zachary Bogue, a co-founder of DCVC does not invest in: Carbon offsets.

""We really don't underwrite or like to see companies that are using carbon offsets,"" Bogue told CNBC in an interview at the end of September in an interview in the Palo Alto office. ""We do not look at companies that need to use carbon offsets to make their business model work.""

A carbon offset is a certificate or voucher that a company or organization buys that represents the reduction of a metric ton, or 2,205 pounds, of carbon dioxide emissions. If a company or organization is unable to eliminate the release of greenhouse gasses in their operations, they may purchase a carbon offset to compensate for their emissions.

""There's been some studies out there that up to 90% of carbon offsets are completely ineffective — have had no impact — which is a tragedy of our time, because big Fortune 500 companies are paying millions of dollars to these carbon offsets, and continuing to emit in the meantime,"" Bogue told CNBC. ""And these offsets are actually having zero impact.""

The effectiveness of a carbon offset is a contentious issue, but at least one white paper published in April 2021 from the Finnish nonprofit and startup Compensate found that 90 percent of carbon capture projects were ineffective. Compensate has both a non-profit advocacy arm and a company that sells what it deems to be high quality carbon offsets. For the white paper, Compensate analyzed more than 100 nature-based carbon offsets certified by third-party verifiers in the space.

Of the carbon offsets which Compensate deemed a failure, 52% were guilty of what Compensate called ""additionality"" -- for instance, offset credits sold to protect trees that were never in any danger of being cut down. Another 16% of the projects Compensate analyzed were considered a failure because their permanence was considered in jeopardy. For example, coastal restoration projects for mangroves in Bangladesh were jeopardized when floods devastated the country, Compensate said.

So, too, said Bogue of local California projects.

""There were some forests north of here that were the subject of carbon offsets where someone paid millions of dollars to not cut the forest down and — whether or not that's legitimate, we can leave that aside — because those forests burned down,"" Bogue said. ""So they actually released the carbon that the company was paying to not have released and that the company emitted.""

DCVC does not invest in companies that use carbon offsets right now, but that is not an indictment against the idea.

""To be clear, I want I want them to exist,"" Bogue told CNBC. ""I want there to be a carbon tax, I want carbon credits, carbon offsets.""

But there isn't enough transparency or accountability in the industry, Bogue said. To properly stand up the industry, there would need to be an agency akin to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), according to Bogue.

""There's a very set and rigorous process that you need to do to take a molecule from discovery and up until you're dosing a human with it: You need to prove that it's effective, you need to prove it's non toxic,"" Bogue said. ""I would say that the imperative to reducing CO2 is as high of a human health imperative as putting small molecules into our body. Full stop.""

Until then, the industry is too uncertain to be a safe place for the money that DCVC invests on behalf of its limited partners, which are the likes of college endowments and hospitals.

""It needs to be rigorous, and apples to apples and, and verifiable and documentable,"" Bogue said. ""That's just not where it is today. That's where we need to get to, but that's also why don't think it's investable."""

After years of record capital spending, chipmakers are warning on a weekly basis that demand is sputtering. In the latest sign of trouble, Samsung Electronics Co. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. reported disappointing results within hours of each other that widely missed projections.

Samsung -- the world’s largest memory chipmaker -- reported a 32% dive in operating income, while PC-processor maker AMD said it will miss its earlier forecast by about $1 billion. Analysts’ reactions ranged from “breathtaking” to “Uff-da!”

Those numbers followed grim comments from memory makers Micron Technologies Inc. and Kioxia Holdings Corp., which are slashing spending and output in a bid to stabilize plummeting prices. AMD shares fell in premarket trading, along with chipmakers including Nvidia Corp. and Intel Corp. Chip gear suppliers such as ASML Holding NV and PC makers including Lenovo Group Ltd. also dropped. Japan’s Disco Corp., whose equipment grinds, polishes and dices chips, lost the most in more than two years Friday.

“It seems end demand has likely deteriorated markedly in recent weeks, and end customers appear to be aggressively draining inventory,” Bernstein’s Stacy Rasgon said. The cut in AMD’s client-revenue “is admittedly a bit breathtaking.”

The outlier has been Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which posted a roughly 48% surge in quarterly revenue to about NT$613 billion ($19.4 billion) -- at the top range of its guidance in US dollar terms -- helped by its growing clout as the world’s most advanced maker of chips. The downtrend in demand may not have been fully reflected in the numbers, especially given the sharp depreciation of the Taiwan dollar, Haitong International Securities analyst Jeff Pu said.

Consumer electronics companies that had struggled with shortages during the pandemic are now facing a sudden falloff in demand, even while shipping and materials costs remain high. Recession fears are making cost-cuttingthe new norm across the tech industry, and businesses that hoarded chips for two years are now opting to cancel or postpone orders and tap inventory, just as new capacity goes online.

The semiconductor industry is also grappling with export restrictions from the US government, which is ratcheting up pressure on its allies to prevent shipment of cutting-edge chips to a growing list of Chinese companies, as it seeks to contain the Asian country. That’s hampering business for chipmakers from AMD to Nvidia in the world’s biggest semiconductor market.

Supply and demand are not all that is behind the current downcycle, said Heo Pil-Seok, chief executive officer at Midas International Asset Management in Seoul. “The US government’s exports controls would further limit IT companies’ sales in China and a large chunk of demand for chips will be weakened. If AMD, Nvidia can’t sell their chips in China, memory makers’ earnings will deteriorate further.”

The PC segment, which has for years been losing ground to smartphones, looks particularly vulnerable. But a serious recession would hammer demand even in areas that have remained solid, such as in cloud computing, automotives and factory automation.

“We would continue to stay away from PC-centric names, which within our coverage list include AMD, Intel, and Nvidia, due to a likely prolonged PC downturn into next year and continued weakness in consumer gaming,” Baird analysts Tristan Gerra and Tyler Bomba wrote in a note to clients.

Share prices dropped throughout the semiconductor supply chain, from materials makers like JSR Corp. to chip gear makers such as Advantest Corp. and Screen Holdings Co. Even silicon wafer makers such as Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. and Sumco Corp. fell.

The companies themselves are bracing for a prolonged downturn. Samsung’s chip business head, Kyung Kyehyun, said last month he doesn’t see the memory market rebounding throughout next year. Kyung told employees at an internal event that Samsung cut its guidance for chip sales in the second half of this year by 32% compared to a forecast in April, according to the Korea Economic Daily.

What Bloomberg Intelligence Says

PC demand will continue to be soft in 4Q, given heavy PC processor inventory as announced by chipmaker AMD. Won depreciation might not be enough to offset weak sales of memory chips and consumer electronics, such as TVs.

Delivery times for key components and machinery sometimes exceeded one year during the pandemic, causing companies to stockpile a year’s worth of inventory, while chipmakers rushed to ramp up capacity. Now that lead times have dropped, companies are scrambling to reduce stockpiles.

“You build supply for demand that turns out not to be as real as you thought it was,” Rasgon said. “No party lasts forever.”

Most Read from Bloomberg

AMD blamed disappointing preliminary results on weakness in the personal computer market, sending its shares and those of other companies involved in the sector lower in postmarket trading. AMD, Nvidia Corp., Intel Corp. and Microchip Technology Inc. were among chipmakers down more than 2%, while computer makers HP Inc. and Dell Technologies Inc. also fell.

The Santa Clara, California-based company’s announcement was followed by a report from South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. that its profit dropped for the first time since 2019, underscoring the depth of a global PC and memory chip downturn. Samsung shares slid as much as 2% before erasing losses.

Futures tracking the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index slipped as much as 0.6% during early trading hours in Asia, before recovering. Weak demand and supply chain issues in the semiconductor sector may have already been priced in, leaving futures little changed ahead of Friday’s US monthly payrolls data, according to Tina Teng, an analyst with CMC Markets.

Investors are bracing for a potentially difficult earnings season amid rising risk of a recession with inflation and the strong dollar eating into profit margins. Analysts have trimmed 2023 profit estimates for technology companies at a faster rate than the broader market, though most expect further cuts if results disappoint.

Like its peers, AMD blamed the PC market for hurting sales, citing weaker demand and a build-up of inventory in the supply chain. The third quarter also will include $160 million in writedowns related to inventory, pricing and other issues, the company said.

AMD is the latest company related to the PC industry that has warned investors that the market for its products is imploding. Nvidia Corp. and Intel Corp. have already shaved billions off their projections and said they need to burn off stockpiles of unused parts.

While AMD has been making market-share gains at Intel’s expense, the company isn’t immune from the collapse in demand for PCs. Consumers who splurged on technology during pandemic lockdowns are now cutting back spending on big-ticket electronics as they confront recession fears and inflation.

“While our product portfolio remains very strong, macroeconomic conditions drove lower than expected PC demand and a significant inventory correction,” Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su said in the statement.

The stock fell about 5.1% in premarket trading after closing at $67.85 in New York on Thursday. Even before the drop, the shares were down 53% this year, part of a broader pullback for the chip industry. Other semiconductor makers, including Nvidia and Intel, also slipped after AMD’s report.

AMD plans to report full third-quarter earnings on Nov. 1, followed by a conference call to discuss the results. The company said it doesn’t plan to give any additional financial updates before then.

Reflecting its relatively strong performance compared with Intel, AMD said its gross margin -- the percentage of sales remaining after deducting costs -- will be about 50% in the quarter. That’s down from an earlier projection but wider than Intel’s once industry-leading profitability levels.

e3f73ee7-7846-475e-85c8-362aae04d242,"(Reuters) - Dire forecasts from Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Advanced Micro Devices Inc sent chip-related shares lower on Friday, sparking fears that a slump in demand for semiconductors could be much worse than expected.

AMD, Nvidia Corp, Intel Corp, Qualcomm Inc and Micron Technology Inc were down between 1.2% and 6.0%, weighing on smaller peers such as Marvell Technology Inc and Applied Materials Inc.

Samsung, the world's top maker of memory chips, smartphones and televisions, is a bellwether for global consumer demand and its disappointing preliminary results add to a flurry of earnings downgrades and gloomy forecasts.

The chip sector has been grappling with weak demand, spurred by decades-high inflation, rising interest rates, geopolitical tensions and pandemic-related lockdowns in China, hitting the PC and smartphone market as businesses and consumers rein in expenses.

Nearly a dozen analysts cut their price targets on AMD's shares by as much as $50 after the U.S.-based chipmaker slashed its third-quarter revenue outlook by about a billion dollars.

""We believe AMD's warning will have the most negative read-across for PC peer Intel, but also somewhat for Nvidia and related memory and data center peers,"" BofA Securities analyst Vivek Arya said.

Memory chip buyers such as smartphone and PC makers are holding off on new purchases and using up existing inventory, leading to lower shipments and ushering in an industry downcycle.

""We still think the industry is heading for its deepest downcycle in a decade, thanks to high supply chain inventories and falling end demand,"" Jefferies analysts said.

Global chip sales grew just 0.1% in August, making it the 15th month of a downcycle since June 2021, when sales rose more than 30%, according to Jefferies.

Shares of major U.S. chipmakers have already lost between a third and half of their value so far this year, following huge gains last year when Nvidia was inching closer to a trillion-dollar valuation.

Preliminary third quarter revenue of approximately $5.6 billion, lower than prior outlook of $6.7 billion plus or minus $200 million, primarily due to weaker Client segment revenue

Revenue for Data Center, Gaming, and Embedded Segments each grew significantly year-over-year and in-line with the company’s expectations

Management to discuss financial results and outlook on Nov. 1 earnings call



SANTA CLARA, Calif., Oct. 06, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) today announced selected preliminary financial results for the third quarter of 2022.

Third quarter revenue is expected to be approximately $5.6 billion, an increase of 29% year-over-year. AMD previously expected revenue to increase approximately 55% year-over-year at the mid-point of guidance. Preliminary results reflect lower than expected Client segment revenue resulting from reduced processor shipments due to a weaker than expected PC market and significant inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain.

Revenue for the Data Center, Gaming, and Embedded segments each increased significantly year-over-year in-line with the company’s expectations.

Gross margin is expected to be approximately 42% and non-GAAP(*) gross margin is expected to be approximately 50%. AMD previously expected non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 54%. The gross margin shortfall to expectations was primarily due to lower revenue driven by lower Client processor unit shipments and average selling price (ASP). In addition, the third quarter results are expected to include approximately $160 million of charges primarily for inventory, pricing, and related reserves in the graphics and client businesses.

Third quarter operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.4 billion and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.5 billion. Non-GAAP operating expenses are lower than previous expectations of $1.6 billion driven by lower variable compensation expenses in the quarter.

“The PC market weakened significantly in the quarter,” said AMD Chair and CEO Dr. Lisa Su. “While our product portfolio remains very strong, macroeconomic conditions drove lower than expected PC demand and a significant inventory correction across the PC supply chain. As we navigate the current market conditions, we are pleased with the performance of our Data Center, Embedded, and Gaming segments and the strength of our diversified business model and balance sheet. We remain focused on delivering our leadership product roadmap and look forward to launching our next-generation 5nm data center and graphics products later this quarter.”

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon on Monday warned that a ""very, very serious"" mix of headwinds was likely to tip both the U.S. and global economy into recession by the middle of next year. Dimon, chief executive of the largest bank in the U.S., said the U.S. economy was ""actually still doing well"" at present and consumers were likely to be in better shape compared with the 2008 global financial crisis. related investing news Top JPMorgan stock strategist says the bear market lows are likely to be retested soon ""But you can't talk about the economy without talking about stuff in the future — and this is serious stuff,"" Dimon told CNBC's Julianna Tatelbaum on Monday at the JPM Techstars conference in London. Among the indicators ringing alarm bells, Dimon cited the impact of runaway inflation, interest rates going up more than expected, the unknown effects of quantitative tightening and Russia's war in Ukraine.

""These are very, very serious things which I think are likely to push the U.S. and the world — I mean, Europe is already in recession — and they're likely to put the U.S. in some kind of recession six to nine months from now,"" Dimon said. His comments come at a time of growing concern about the prospect of an economic recession as the Federal Reserve and other major central banks raise interest rates to combat soaring inflation. Speaking to CNBC last month, Chicago Federal Reserve President Charles Evans said he's feeling apprehensive about the U.S. central bank going too far, too fast in its bid to tackle high inflation rates. The Fed raised benchmark interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point last month, the third consecutive increase of that size. Fed officials also indicated they would continue hiking rates well above the current range of 3% to 3.25%.

Dimon said that while the Fed ""waited too long and did too little"" as inflation jumped to four-decade highs, the central bank is ""clearly catching up."" ""And, you know, from here, let's all wish him success and keep our fingers crossed that they managed to slow down the economy enough so that whatever it is, is mild — and it is possible,"" he added.

'To guess is hard, be prepared'

Dimon said he couldn't be sure how long a recession in the U.S. might last, adding that market participants should assess a range of outcomes instead. ""It can go from very mild to quite hard and a lot will be reliant on what happens with this war. So, I think to guess is hard, be prepared."" Dimon said the one guarantee he could be sure of was volatile markets. He also warned that this could coincide with disorderly financial conditions. Asked for his views on the outlook for the S&P 500 , Dimon said the benchmark could yet fall by ""another easy 20%"" from current levels, adding that ""the next 20% would be much more painful than the first."" Speaking to a roomful of analysts and investors in early June, Dimon said he was preparing the bank for an economic ""hurricane"" caused by the Federal Reserve and Russia's war in Ukraine.

""JPMorgan is bracing ourselves and we're going to be very conservative with our balance sheet,"" Dimon said at the time. He advised investors to do the same.

Runaway inflation, big interest rates hikes, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the unknown effects of the Federal Reserve's quantitative tightening policy are among the indicators of a potential recession, he said in an interview to the business news channel.

""These are very, very serious things which I think are likely to push the U.S. and the world — I mean, Europe is already in recession — and they're likely to put the U.S. in some kind of recession six to nine months from now,"" Dimon said.

His comments come as the big U.S. banks are set to report their third-quarter earnings from Friday. So far this year, the benchmark S&P 500 index has lost about 24%, with all the three major U.S. indices trading in bear market territory.

Dimon said the S&P 500 could fall by ""another easy 20%"" from the current levels, with the next 20% slide likely to ""be much more painful than the first"", according to the CNBC report.

Earlier this year, Dimon had asked investors to brace for an economic ""hurricane"", with JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. investment bank, suspending share buybacks in July after missing quarterly Wall Street expectations.

In June, Goldman Sachs had predicted a 30% chance of the U.S. economy tipping into recession over the next year, while the economists at Morgan Stanley placed the odds of a recession for the next 12 months at around 35%.

World Bank President David Malpass and International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva also warned on Monday of a growing risk of global recession and said inflation remained a problem after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

2aadb758-2030-4059-bec8-e9662293e647,"Australia could be plunged into chaos with spiralling unemployment and poverty if the nation goes into recession, leading economists have warned.

One of Australia's 'Big Four' banks is concerned aggressive interest rate hikes to tackle worsening inflation could tip Australia into a recession.

The Reserve Bank of Australia is widely expected to announce its sixth consecutive monthly rate hike today, with a predicted 0.5 percentage point rise.

This would take interest rates to a nine-year high of 2.85 per cent - compared with a record-low of 0.1 per cent as recently as early May.

A 50 basis point rate rise on Tuesday means a borrower with an average $600,000 mortgage would see their monthly repayments climb by $179 to $3,145.

Borrowers are already copping the steepest rate rises since 1994 with economists at CommSec, the Commonwealth Bank's online broking arm, warning steep rate rises 28 years ago came close to tipping Australia into a recession again.

The futures market is expecting the cash rate to hit 4.1 per cent by May next year.

The Reserve Bank warned the outlook for the global economy was not good, with economists saying that a recession is 'on the cards' for Australia.

If a recession occurred, then unemployment would rise rapidly, and poverty would 'absolutely' increase, Matt Grudnoff, senior economist and director of the economics program at The Australia Institute think tank told Daily Mail Australia.

Economist Ross Garnaut, who is also a professor at the University of Melbourne, said that the cost of recession would be 'very high' and send Aussies back to 'long term unemployment'

Economist Ross Garnaut, a professor at the University of Melbourne, added that the recession cost would be 'very high' and send Aussies back to 'long term unemployment'.

What the banks are NOW expecting WESTPAC: 3.6 per cent cash rate by February 2023 (up from 3.35 per cent) COMMONWEALTH BANK: 2.85 per cent cash rate by November (up from 2.6 per cent) ANZ: 3.35 per cent cash rate by December (out from November) NAB: 2.85 per cent cash rate by November Advertisement !- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/au/news/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - ->

Mr Grudnoff said it could take years for Australia to recover from a potential technical recession - defined as two consecutive quarters of economic contraction.

'With the Covid-19 pandemic recession, there was a quick bounce back, but that was an unusual one,' he said.

'There's no guarantee of a bounce back if we go into an interest rate recession. Unemployment would rise rapidly and it would cause a snowball effect leading to even more people losing their jobs.

'The current recession has parallels to the 1991 recession, and it took 10 years for unemployment to recover to prior levels after that.'

Australia's unemployment rate in September 1989 stood at 6 per cent but 17.5 per cent interest rates pushed Australia into recession by 1991, with the jobless rate hitting double digits later that year and staying at those levels until 1994.

The jobless rate didn't return to 1989 levels until July 2000, historical Australian Bureau of Statistics labour force data shows.

Mr Grudnoff said borrowers would struggle to pay off their mortgage and the price of houses and rentals would fall as unemployment rose.

If a recession does come to pass then unemployment will rise rapidly and poverty will 'absolutely' increase, Matt Grudnoff, Senior Economist and Director of the Economics Program at The Australia Institute said

The economist suggested a recession could even lead to a rise in homelessness.

While unemployment in August was at a near 48-year low of 3.5 per cent, Professor Garnaut said a recession would cause a joblessness surge.

'The costs of recession would be very high,' he said.

'People who have had a chance to enter employment in the stronger labour market conditions of the past year, and people like them, would be sent back to long-term unemployment.

'Australia would return to an even worse place than the Dog Days in the half dozen years before the pandemic: unemployment and rising underemployment as in 2013-19, and real wages declining so even worse than the stagnation of those years.

'The public debt position would deteriorate further, and public finances would come under great pressure.'

Fellow economist Mr Grudnoff added that the government would need to respond quickly to avoid even more disastrous problems.

The economist warned that benefits and welfare payments would need to rise, and if the government isn't decisive in its response, there could also be a rise in people needing food banks in Australia.

'If the government steps up, we should not see food issues, but poverty will absolutely rise. There'll be more people in poverty in Australia because of the recession.

'If the government doesn't respond properly, we could see a rise in food banks and an increase in homelessness.'

However, he added that food is an essential so the fall in demand won't be large.

Benefits and welfare payments would need to rise and if the government isn't decisive in its response, there could also be a rise in people needing food banks in Australia, an economist warned

More at risk are shops that don't sell essential goods, with Mr Grudnoff noting that a decrease in people's income could see some stores to lose their business.

Falling income from unemployment could also lead to struggles to pay energy bills, leading to scenes that could mirror those seen in places like the UK.

However, Professor Garnaut added that Australia is in a better position than some other countries.

'Fortunately, there is no need for recession, even if the US, UK and the EU descend into that unhappy condition,' he said.

'We will avoid recession if the Reserve Bank takes its statutory responsibility to achieve Full Employment seriously in the period ahead.'

His view was echoed by Professor Percy Allan from the Institute for Public Policy and Governance at the University of Technology Sydney.

'Australia is in a better position than the UK because our inflation is less aggressive, so our interest rate rises need not be as high to dampen the economy,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

Economist Mr Grudnoff added that the government would need to respond quickly to avoid even more disastrous problems like food shortages

'Nevertheless, our economy will slow, and unemployment will rise as higher interest rates and tighter credit bite.

'Whether that will amount to a recession is too early to say. If the Reserve Bank of Australia pushes its cash rate to three per cent or higher, there is a strong possibility of a recession.'

UK Prime Minister Liz Truss won the Conservative Party leadership ballot of party members by promising to cap electricity bills and deliver the biggest tax cuts since the 1970s, only to spark fears of higher interest rates from the Bank of England.

'Finally, Britain is breaking from orthodoxy under PM Truss, her government has decided to blow out its operating deficit to boost economic growth,' Professor Allan said.

'At the same time, the Bank of England is tightening credit and pushing up interest rates to slow growth so as to crush runaway inflation.

'It's akin to a driver putting one foot on the accelerator and the other on the brake. There is a high risk that this will cause a market panic with the pound falling further and capital fleeing the country.

'By contrast in Australia, the government deficit is shrinking thanks to high commodity prices and still strong business conditions.'

Australian inflation grew by 6.8 per cent in the year to August but the Reserve Bank and Treasury are expecting it in 2022 to hit a 32-year high of 7.75 per cent.

Headline inflation - also known as the consumer price index - is more than double the RBA's two to three per cent target.

Nonetheless, this is still much lower than the UK's 9.9 per cent inflation rate for August or the U.S. level of 8.3 per cent.

Australia's 2020 Covid recession, as a result of lockdowns, was the first since 1991, which occurred after interest rates had hit 17.5 per cent during an era when houses were much cheaper as a proportion of income."

So is recession now inevitable in Australia? Not at all.

The good news is there are several reasons to think Australia might be able to escape a global slide into recession – though it will need careful management.

What could push Australia into recession?

Here’s the worst case scenario. The United States keeps pushing up interest rates until it brings on a recession, and Australia gets pressured to do the same.

Here’s how it’s playing out at the moment. The US Federal Reserve has lifted rates at each of its past five meetings. The past three hikes have been massive by Australian and US standards – 0.75 percentage points each, enough to slow already-forecast US economic growth to a trickle, which is what the Fed wants to fight inflation.

But the Fed is planning to go further. Its chair, Jerome Powell says he expects ongoing increases, and last week countenanced the possibility they would throw the country into recession:

We don’t know, no one knows, whether this process will lead to a recession or if so, how significant that recession would be. That’s going to depend on how quickly wage and price inflation pressures come down, whether expectations remain anchored, and whether also we get more labour supply.

Powell is saying he is prepared to risk a recession to get inflation down.

The UK’s top banker already expects a recession

Powell’s not alone. His UK equivalent, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey, has lifted rates seven times since December. Bailey says he is prepared to do more to fight inflation – “forcefully, as necessary” – and is actually forecasting a recession, which he says has probably started.

So alarmed is the new UK government headed by Liz Truss that on Friday it unveiled a £45 billion (A$75 billion) “growth plan” made up of tax cuts and infrastructure spending, on top of spending of £60 billion (A$100 billion) to cap household and business energy bills.

Given what’s now happening overseas, you might expect Australia’s Reserve Bank to take note and behave differently to central banks overseas.

Except it’s not quite that easy.

Pressure to follow the US

Whenever the US hikes interest rates (it’s hiked them seven times since March), investors buy US dollars to take advantage of the higher rates. This forces up the price of the US dollar in relation to currencies of countries that didn’t hike.

This means unless countries such as Australia hike in line with the US, the values of their currencies are likely to fall in relation to the US dollar – meaning their values are likely to fall in relation to the currency in which most trade takes place.

This means more expensive imports, which means more inflation.

And Australia’s Reserve Bank is trying to contain inflation.

The upshot is whenever the US pushes up rates (no matter how recklessly) there’s pressure on Australia to do the same, simply to stop inflation getting worse.

The risk of ‘a gratuitously severe recession’

Since March, when the US began pushing up interest rates more aggressively than Australia, the value of the Australian dollar has slid from US0.73 to less than $US0.65, putting upward pressure on goods traded in US dollars of about 11%.

Neil Hall/EPA

With Australian inflation already forecast to hit 7.75% this year, way above the Reserve Bank’s 2-3% target, still more inflation is what the bank doesn’t want.

This locks countries such as Britain (whose currency has fallen to an all-time low against the US in the wake of the tax cuts) and Japan (whose government has intervened to try to stop its currency falling) into a semi-dependent relationship with the US.

Failing to follow its lead makes inflation worse.

It is why US economist Paul Krugman says there is serious risk the Fed’s actions “will push America and the world into a gratuitously severe recession”.

Going your own way can hurt your dollar

The risk isn’t merely that the US will go too far. The risk is that other countries, including ours, will ape the US in pushing up rates to maintain the value of their currencies, amplifying the effect of a US recession and making it global.

It’s often said that central banks hunt in packs. What’s less often noted is the pressure they are under to follow each other.

In Australia, AMP chief economist Shane Oliver puts it starkly: if the Reserve Bank doesn’t follow the US Fed, the Australian dollar might crash.

But here’s the good news. We know Australia can avoid the worst of global economic downturns, because we’ve done it before.

How Australia has avoided past recessions – and can again

Australia avoided recession during the 1997 Asian financial crisis, we escaped the 2001 US “tech-wreck”, and we avoided the “great recession” during the global financial crisis.

In part, this has been due to excellent judgement. Our Reserve Bank was able to take clear-eyed decisions about when to follow the US on rates and when not to.

At times it was helped by high commodity prices, which are high again following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and which are supporting our currency, even though we are increasing rates less aggressively than the United States.

At the right moment, Australia’s Reserve Bank would be wise to decouple from the US. If the Fed pushes up rates to the point where it is about to bring on a US recession, Australia would be well advised to stand back and not lift rates, letting the collapse of the US economy bring down inflation by itself.

If Australia’s Reserve Bank thinks that moment is approaching, it should consider shrinking the size of its rate rises (the last four have been 0.5 percentage points).

Its next meeting is next Tuesday. Because of its importance, the Bureau of Statistics is bringing forward the publication of its new monthly measure of inflation to this Thursday, publishing the results for both July and August at once.

But the bank will need more than information. It’ll need the intuition and common sense that has kept us out of trouble in the past."
32625999-f513-4b91-961d-ade8d551a6dd,"(Corrects paragraph 2 to say quantitative tightening, not easing, based on video of the CNBC interview. The error had appeared in the previous version too.)

Oct 10 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said the United States and the global economy could tip into a recession by the middle of the next year, CNBC reported on Monday.

Runaway inflation, big interest rates hikes, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the unknown effects of the Federal Reserve's quantitative tightening policy are among the indicators of a potential recession, he said in an interview to the business news channel.

""These are very, very serious things which I think are likely to push the U.S. and the world — I mean, Europe is already in recession — and they're likely to put the U.S. in some kind of recession six to nine months from now,"" Dimon said.

His comments come as the big U.S. banks are set to report their third-quarter earnings from Friday. So far this year, the benchmark S&P 500 index has lost about 24%, with all the three major U.S. indices trading in bear market territory.

Dimon said the S&P 500 could fall by ""another easy 20%"" from the current levels, with the next 20% slide likely to ""be much more painful than the first"", according to the CNBC report.

Earlier this year, Dimon had asked investors to brace for an economic ""hurricane"", with JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. investment bank, suspending share buybacks in July after missing quarterly Wall Street expectations.

In June, Goldman Sachs had predicted a 30% chance of the U.S. economy tipping into recession over the next year, while the economists at Morgan Stanley placed the odds of a recession for the next 12 months at around 35%.

World Bank President David Malpass and International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva also warned on Monday of a growing risk of global recession and said inflation remained a problem after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

0e58e9ac-fe60-4dcc-ace9-28198aaa0b42,"The US is facing rising recession fears as the Federal Reserve remains bullish in fighting high inflation.

The United States is facing rising recession fears as the Federal Reserve, the country’s central bank, remains bullish in fighting high inflation and officials increasingly talk about the need to impose some economic pain to get price pressures under control, several economists told Al Jazeera.

“There’s still a good amount of strength in the labour market and that’s going to allow the Fed to remain aggressive in fighting inflation,” Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at OANDA, a New York-based foreign exchange firm, told Al Jazeera.

“Price pressures are not going away. And when we take a look at energy prices, the downward move that we’ve been appreciating appears to be over and it looks like oil and gas prices are gonna be heading higher once again,” he said.

The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a grouping known as OPEC+, last week decided to cut oil output by 2 million barrels of crude per day.

“That increases costs, not just for energy, but everything we do and everything we buy. And so the price of everything goes up, including food,” EJ Antoni, research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank in Washington DC, explained.

US gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of goods and services output, contracted 0.6 percent last quarter after shrinking 1.6 percent between January and March. The common rule of thumb for recessions is two consecutive quarterly declines in GDP.

“We’ve already had the recession in the first six months of the year. It looks like the third quarter is going to come in positive but after that, all bets are off. I think we’re gonna go negative again,” Antoni said.

Economists have not been unanimous in that belief as some indicators point to underlying strength in the economy.

The US trade deficit narrowed in August to its lowest level in more than a year. And Goldman Sachs last week boosted the US third quarter GDP estimate by a full percentage point to a 1.9 percent annualised rate.

The Biden administration continues to argue that the economy is resilient, pointing to the lowest unemployment rate in five decades and unwavering consumer confidence.

But nearly seven in 10 Americans recently said they are worried about a recession and four in 10 said they are financially unprepared to handle one if it were to hit before the end of 2023, according to a poll by Bankrate, a New York-based financial firm.

So what are the key metrics pointing to? How do economists make sense between plummeting markets and a resilient labour market? And what does a US recession mean for the global economy?

Majority of CEOs anticipate a recession in the next year

More than eight out of 10 CEOs recently said they anticipate a recession during the next 12 months, according to a new survey from accounting firm KPMG (PDF). Out of the 1,300 CEOs at the world’s largest companies KPMG surveyed, 73 percent said they believe that an economic downturn will disrupt growth.

About 39 percent of the CEOs have implemented a hiring freeze while 46 percent are considering downsizing their employee base during the next six months, KPMG found.

And it is difficult for them to ignore the data.

Wall Street has plummeted in the past year. The S&P 500 – a proxy for the health of retirement and college savings accounts – closed the third quarter at its lowest level in almost two years. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 has dropped nearly 33 percent so far in 2022 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost more than 20 percent.

Cryptocurrencies, which surged in popularity and price during the pandemic, have also nosedived. The world’s top digital coin, Bitcoin, shed more than 60 percent of its value in the past year while the second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum dropped 61 percent.

US mortgage rates have more than doubled in the last year, locking millions of Americans out of homeownership.

“We could have had a mild, short recession if the Fed, Congress and president acted much sooner but unfortunately, now, there’s a tremendous amount of economic pain that’s already baked into the cake,” Antoni told Al Jazeera.

“One of the tragedies of the Biden administration is that they had the benefit of hindsight. They could have looked back at their immediate predecessor and learned from what worked and what didn’t, but they just continued on with bad policy.”

Strong labour market or a ‘desperate’ one?

Tens of millions of Americans quit their jobs during the height of the pandemic in what is now widely known as the Great Resignation. Since then businesses from gas stations to doctors’ offices have struggled to find workers.

OANDA’s Moya explained that as long as job openings remain high, the Fed will continue to raise interest rates to make borrowing more pricey in hopes of balancing demand and supply.

“The Fed is going to be locked in a corner where they have to tighten policy much more aggressively,” he added.

New data showed last week that the number of job openings in the US plunged by 1.1 million and jobless claims increased more than expected. The unemployment rate hit a half century-low of 3.5 percent in September however signaling a tight labour market.

But not everyone sees it that way.

“I don’t see a strong labour market, I see a desperate labour market,” Heritage Foundation’s Antoni told Al Jazeera. “We have a disproportionate number of people working multiple jobs. That gooses the jobs numbers because every time a person works another job, they are counted as another job holder.”

“We’ve had a lot of small businesses fail from pandemic lockdowns and if those people go to work for a large corporation, they are now counted in those surveys. So again, even though the number of jobs hasn’t actually changed, the number of people employed, the number in the survey, goes up,” Antoni said.

Global setbacks

The COVID-19 pandemic and war in Ukraine have caused “extraordinary shocks” to the global economy, the World Bank recently said (PDF), warning that advances towards eliminating extreme poverty by 2030 have essentially come to a halt.

The number of people living on just $2.15 a day increased 11 percent in 2020 — from 648 million to 719 million, according to the World Bank.

A US recession would cause deep pain in the developing world, Richard Kozul-Wright, director of the globalisation division at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), told Al Jazeera.

The UN agency issued a dire warning last week that a global slowdown could potentially inflict worse damage than the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 COVID-19 shock.

“If a financial shock in the US is triggered, there is no limit to the downside,” Kozul-Wright said.

“The US ultimately had the policy space to shore up both its economy and its financial system if it finds the political appetite for more bailouts. But most countries in the world, especially in the South have no real safety net,” he added.

As for emerging markets, OANDA’s Moya said many of them have been aggressive in their fight against inflation.

“What’s been killing them is this relentlessly strong dollar,” he explained. “A recession in the US would mean that the dollar’s days are over. And some relief would be good news for emerging markets.”

But again, it is a very fine line. If the US dips into a long period of sluggish growth, emerging markets are going to struggle. Major exporters to the US such as China, Mexico and Canada would feel pain if US demand weakened for a prolonged period of time.

As for how severe a US recession could be, Moya echoed the sentiments of many economists Al Jazeera spoke with: “It’s still too soon to have strong conviction with that call just because we don’t know exactly how sticky inflation is going to be and how resilient the economy is.”"
80ce5d2c-5002-459d-af0c-a59d523af0f2,"Chalmers will deliver his first budget on October 25, a re-do of the effort produced for the 2022-23 financial year in late March by then treasurer Josh Frydenberg.

That the two men who will have the biggest say about the state of the Australian economy used related metaphors highlights the difficult conditions the world’s policymakers now face.

At the Reserve Bank headquarters in Sydney, bank governor Philip Lowe took the storm warning to its logical end, saying the RBA was intent on “ keeping the economy on an even keel ”.

Twice more he referenced the dark clouds that threatened his budget, blowing in from the United States, from China, from Ukraine, from the EU and from Britain.

“The storm clouds are gathering again in the global economy,” he said in a press conference called after the Reserve Bank lifted official interest rates to a nine-year high .

Treasurer Jim Chalmers sounded more like a meteorologist than a politician when this week he sought to explain the issues affecting his first budget.

The Federal Reserve has interest rates in the US at between 3 and 3.25 per cent with markets expecting them to top 4.6 per cent by the end of next year.

The Russia-Ukraine war had begun when the March budget was launched, but the economic impact has only worsened since then. Credit:Kate Geraghty

The Reserve Bank is in the midst of the most aggressive tightening of monetary policy since 1994 with the cash rate at 2.6 per cent and forecast to go higher by Christmas.

Today, inflation is expected to reach 7.75 per cent by year’s end. Real wages are forecast by Treasury to continue falling throughout the next financial year.

Treasury was forecasting inflation to peak around 4.25 per cent with real wages tipped to grow in 2022-23.

The US Federal Reserve had increased interest rates for the first time in two years, taking its key rate indicator from 0.25 per cent to 0.5 per cent. The Reserve Bank still had the cash rate at 0.1 per cent.

That early budget was set down in a markedly different economic environment. Russia had invaded Ukraine but the surge in commodity prices that has fed into global inflation had yet to materialise.

The immediate problem is one to be dealt with by the new government.

The economic and fiscal environment is not just different to the picture painted in the March budget. It’s as if we are on another planet.

“We are courting the risk of a global recession that at its worst could bring down housing markets, bankrupt businesses and states and throw hundreds of millions of people worldwide into unemployment and distress,” he said.

While higher interest rates could drive down inflation, Tooze said there was also the risk of economic disaster.

Respected economic historian Adam Tooze this week noted that we are now “in the midst of the most comprehensive tightening of monetary policy the world has seen”.

Key differences between them were ignored.

Opponents to the tax cuts, including some within the government, used the political and economic disaster inflicted on Truss to ramp up their attacks.

Truss’ plan to slash the 45 per cent tax rate to 40 per cent for people earning more than £150,000 swung the focus in Australia back on the stage three tax cuts – due to start in mid-2024 – that were announced by then treasurer Scott Morrison in 2018.

The politics of the budget have taken a turn over the past fortnight after Britain’s prime minister Liz Truss and her mini-budget almost brought the world’s sixth-largest economy to its knees.

Chalmers and Finance Minister Katy Gallagher have to squeeze approximately $2.4 billion worth of Labor’s various election promises into the budget this financial year, navigate economic parameters vastly different to those charted by Frydenberg, worry about a global downturn while laying the foundations of a series of structural changes to the nation’s finances.

The stage three tax cuts have been incorporated into the Australian budget’s long-term forecasts.

The British budget deficit, three times that of Australia’s deficit, will get larger.

One of the reasons for the harsh financial market response to Truss’ tax plan was the state of the British budget. UK government gross debt is about 100 per cent of GDP (in Australia it’s closer to 42 per cent).

Less than 2 per cent of Britons would benefit from the abandoned Truss plan. Australia’s stage three tax cut package will affect seven in 10 taxpayers, albeit with the largest benefits flowing to higher income earners.

Not that Australia is without budget problems.

ANZ senior economists Adelaide Timbrell and Madeline Dunk this week put some rough estimates around the budget.

They are tipping a deficit this year of between $35 billion and $40 billion. Next financial year, they reckon the deficit will increase to between $55 billion and $60 billion with deficits of a similar size in the two years beyond that.

The debate about tax cuts that won’t hit bank accounts for almost two years has clouded the more immediate issues facing the economy.

The Reserve Bank’s six consecutive interest rate rise means the cash rate has jumped by 2.5 percentage points since May. On a $750,000 mortgage, that’s a cumulative $1030 in monthly repayments.

Lowe and the bank are watching carefully two areas – the global economy and how Australian households are responding to the lift in interest rates.

The bank this week also released new data that tracks household debt and asset levels.

The surge in house prices led to the biggest ever increase in household asset holdings. The ratio of housing assets to income reached 6.5 to 1 in March. But that has turned, falling through the June quarter (as almost half a trillion dollars was wiped from Australians’ net worth).

Loading

As the value of household assets fell, housing debt actually increased. Nationally, Australians’ housing debt to total income is now 1.87 to 1 - an all-time high.

Even though interest rates are still historically low, they have never been increased so quickly on a population of mortgagors carrying so much debt. The economic repercussions are clearly unknown.

The Reserve Bank, according to some critics, has been too slow lifting rates to deal with inflation. Across the Tasman, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand this week took interest rates up another 0.5 percentage point to 3.5 per cent.

But there are some analysts who believe central banks might be loosening monetary policy this time next year to deal with the economic slowdown they helped create.

“For many countries, recession will be hard to avoid”: World Bank chief David Malpass is pessimistic about the state of the global economy. Credit:Bloomberg

Financial markets put the chance of a US recession by mid-2023 at about one-in-four. In Britain and across the eurozone, the chances are closer to 75 per cent.

Late last month, World Bank president David Malpass spoke for many about the potential dangers caused by ever-increasing interest rates.

“Global growth is slowing sharply, with further slowing likely as more countries fall into recession,” he said.

Three difficult tasks

Less than a month ago, Lowe used testimony to a parliamentary committee to focus attention on the state of the budget and the state of policy debate in this country.

Lowe noted that despite the highest terms of trade on record and a jobless rate at a 48-year low, the budget was still forecast to remain in deficit.

He said governments of all persuasions had consistently failed to deal with the growing demands of the community for high-quality services and infrastructure. They had also failed to find ways to pay for those demands.

Tax increases, spending cuts and economic reforms had to be on the agenda.

“Each of those are very difficult. Taxes, cutting back and structural reform. We have to do one of those three things, maybe all three of them,” he said.

Chalmers is more than willing to contemplate tax reform, saying there needs to be a “big national conversation” about the budget’s structural position and how it will continue to fund important government services.

Deloitte Access Economics lead partner Pradeep Philip says repurposing the stage three tax cuts needs to be on the government’s agenda.

He said it should not be a debate about whether we should have these cuts, but how tax reform drives economic growth.

“There is real question about the purpose of tax cuts and tax reform and this must be conducted in the light of the big structural issues we face,” he said.

“There is a deep question about size of government; what government actually does; the role of the tax system in incentivising and raising revenue efficiently.”

His argument is similar to that put by new independent MP for the Sydney seat of Wentworth, Allegra Spender, who used an address this week to note the dearth of real debate around tax and the economy.

“Our tax policy doesn’t support productivity, it doesn’t support equity, and it doesn’t support fiscal or environmental sustainability,” she said.

“Despite these challenges, our public debate is often unhelpful. One side calls for higher taxes – and the other side calls for lower spending. There is seldom any real discussion about the quality of our fiscal programmes. And that public neglect has led to policy neglect.”

While a full-throated tax and budget priority debate is yet to begin, a more immediate issue is where both the federal government and the Reserve Bank hope to land the economy.

New PwC chief economist Amy Auster says it is important that budget and monetary policy work in the same direction.

She notes that while government spending reached a high of almost 32 per cent of GDP during the depths of the pandemic, it is now starting to repair as certain COVID-related programs finish up.

While spending is still elevated – around 26 per cent of GDP – it could be reduced gently rather than through a rush of expenditure cuts that would cause broader economic problems.

“We still have a lot of fiscal resilience. We don’t have a fiscal emergency,” she said.

“The important thing is to make sure fiscal and monetary policy aren’t working against each other. ”

By Friday, as the east coast endured more rain, Chalmers was back in the weather business, using a speech in Brisbane to again warn of the “coming economic storm”.

This storm, he said, was being caused by the global inflation shock and a possible hard economic landing caused by rapidly increasing official interest rates. Treasury has knocked down global growth by $US2 trillion over the next two years.

If the storm hits, it would be the third major global economic crisis in the past 15 years.

Budgets, and central banks, had not properly recovered from the global financial crisis when they ran into the COVID pandemic. Now, with inflation high, central banks could end up creating even more long-term troubles.

No one is prepared to predict when these latest clouds will clear.

The U.S. dollar has surged against overseas counterparts, hammering quarterly sales for large multinationals such as Nike and FedEx. Mortgage rates have climbed to nearly 7%, stunting demand for homes. Economic growth — as measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP) — in the first half of the year declined.

Meantime, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), S&P 500 (^GSPC), and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) remain mired in double-digit percentage declines for the year.

The tone in markets may not get much better into year end as companies use the coming earnings season to warn about future economic growth and stubbornly high costs.

""The dollar is very strong, and interest rates are rising very fast,"" Harvard University professor of economics and author Ken Rogoff warned on Yahoo Finance Live. ""So I think the idea that it's going to be a really mild recession, if that, would be lucky. I'd say it's going to be a tough trade-off for the Fed once the numbers start setting in.""

Oct 10 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said the United States and the global economy could tip into a recession by the middle of the next year, CNBC reported on Monday.

Runaway inflation, big interest rates hikes, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the unknown effects of the Federal Reserve's quantitative tightening policy are among the indicators of a potential recession, he said in an interview to the business news channel.

""These are very, very serious things which I think are likely to push the U.S. and the world — I mean, Europe is already in recession — and they're likely to put the U.S. in some kind of recession six to nine months from now,"" Dimon said.

His comments come as the big U.S. banks are set to report their third-quarter earnings from Friday. So far this year, the benchmark S&P 500 index (.SPX) has lost about 24%, with all the three major U.S. indices trading in bear market territory.

Dimon said the S&P 500 could fall by ""another easy 20%"" from the current levels, with the next 20% slide likely to ""be much more painful than the first"", according to the CNBC report.

Earlier this year, Dimon had asked investors to brace for an economic ""hurricane"", with JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. investment bank, suspending share buybacks in July after missing quarterly Wall Street expectations. read more

In June, Goldman Sachs had predicted a 30% chance of the U.S. economy tipping into recession over the next year, while the economists at Morgan Stanley placed the odds of a recession for the next 12 months at around 35%.

World Bank President David Malpass and International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva also warned on Monday of a growing risk of global recession and said inflation remained a problem after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. read more

He said higher inflation, interest rates, and war uncertainty are all contributing to volatile markets.

The stock market could get a lot more painful as a recession is likely to hit the US economy over the next six to nine months, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon told CNBC on Monday.

He said he sees the stock market falling another ""easy 20%"" from current levels, which would put the S&P 500 right around 2,900.

""It really depends"" if the economy sees a soft or hard landing, but ""it could be another easy 20% and I think the next 20% will be much more painful than the first,"" Dimon said. The S&P 500 has fallen 25% year-to-date as investors grapple with elevated inflation and fast rising interest rates.

But as many bullish investors would point out, US consumers and most companies are in great shape from a balance sheet perspective, so that could be sending mixed messages to investors given the plunging stock and bond markets.

""Currently right now, the US economy is actually still doing well. Consumers have money, they're spending 10% more than last year, their balance sheets are in great shape. Yes, debts gone up a little bit, but not near pre-COVID levels. Therefore, even if we go into a recession, they're going to be in much better shape than 2008 and 2009. Companies are in good shape, credit is very good,"" Dimon said.

But you can't talk about the economy without talking about the future, ""and this is serious stuff,"" he added.

Specifically, Dimon is concerned about elevated inflation, fast-rising interest rates, and quantitative tightening, which represents the Fed's reduction of its $9 trillion balance sheet. But most importantly, it's Russia's war against Ukraine that is most unsettling to markets and poses a great risk.

""It's the war. And these are very, very serious things, which I think are likely to put the US in some kind of recession six to nine months from now,"" Dimon said.

There are early signs of distress building in markets, and while they've been orderly in recent months, they can quickly grow disorderly.

""This is really typical. Markets go down... The IPO market closes first, that's kind of happened. High yield closes second, and structured credit. That's kind of happened for the most part. And then it starts to affect other credit. You saw with the gilt markets here, you see the lack of liquidity in a lot of markets,"" Dimon said.

The ultimate panic and financial cracks to the system are likely to be found in credit markets, according to the bank CEO.

""It might be ETFs, it might be a country, it might be something we don't suspect... I would be very cautious. If you need money, go raise it,"" Dimon said.

While he did leave room for the possibility of a soft landing if the Fed makes the right decisions and consumers remain strong, Dimon said, ""the one guarantee is you're going to have volatile markets."""

So much for a sleepy Columbus Day on Wall Street. Stocks weren’t doing much Monday morning but took a turn lower in the afternoon following stark comments from JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who warned that the United States is likely to enter a recession within the next six to nine months.

Dimon made the comments in an exclusive interview with CNBC that aired Monday.

“You can’t talk about the economy without talking about stuff in the future…and this is serious stuff,” Dimon said in the CNBC interview. He added that he thinks Europe is in a recession already and that the US is probably next.

The Dow fell more than 200 points shortly after Dimon’s comments aired before rebounding to end the trading day down nearly 95 points, or 0.3%.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq were each down sharply midday but also bounced off their lows. The S&P 500 closed with a 0.8% loss while the Nasdaq dropped 1%.

Shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which is one of the 30 stocks in the Dow, were down nearly 1%. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is one of several big banks that will report earnings on Friday.

Stocks have tumbled this year due to worries about inflation and how the Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest rate hikes to fight surging prices may eventually lead to a recession. Stocks soared early last week, leading to hopes that the market had bottomed.

But sellers have returned with a vengeance in the past few days. Friday’s mostly solid jobs report did little to dispel fears about more big rate hikes from the Fed.

The Nasdaq hit a new 52-week low Monday. The Dow and S&P 500 are not far from their lows either. The Dow is down about 20% this year and is back in a bear market along with the other two major market indexes.

The bond market was closed Monday, but yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury are currently hovering around 3.89%. The 10-year yield, which heavily influences the direction of mortgage rates, briefly topped 4% late last month and hit its highest level since October 2008.

Fed vice chair Lael Brainard alluded to challenges in the housing market in a speech Monday. Brainard noted that “the moderation in demand due to monetary policy tightening is only partly realized so far” and that “the transmission of tighter policy is most evident in highly interest-sensitive sectors like housing.”

Brainard also warned that “in other sectors, lags in transmission mean that policy actions to date will have their full effect on activity in coming quarters.” In other words, the rest of the economy could soon slow."
e200e509-b311-4685-b36e-8e3dede2bb53,"To say the economy has changed in the past nine months would be an understatement. After a decade in which central bankers and economic policymakers worried that inflation was too low, their concerns have swung 180 degrees.

And we know how they’ve reacted, raising interest rates aggressively to cool the red hot economy and slow demand that has outrun supply and driven prices higher. The Federal Reserve’s benchmark interest rate, which started near zero, is now as high as 3.25 percent. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, to which many long-term borrowing rates are tied, is near 4 percent after starting the year at about 1.6 percent.

The prime rate, the borrowing rate that banks charge their best customers, has climbed to 6.25 percent from 3 percent the beginning of the year, according to the Fed. Credit card interest rates typically are tied to the prime rate, as are home equity lines of credit, a popular vehicle for financing home improvements.

If you are carrying a credit card balance or getting ready to add a bathroom, your carrying costs have increased significantly.

The broad interest rate increases engineered by the Fed are aimed at discouraging people from borrowing and spending — at least borrowing and spending so much. The debate among economists, and the reason for gyrations in stock and commodity markets, focuses on whether the Fed has raised rates so quickly that an economic slowdown will morph into a recession.

STILL NO BARGAIN: Houston homes sales fall for the fifth straight month

The glass-half-full folks are quick to point out that sure, interest rates have risen quickly, but historically, they are pretty reasonable. In the 1980s, when double-digit inflation had become engrained in the U.S. economy, they note, the Fed’s benchmark interest rate hit 20 percent and mortgage rates were running right around that.

Hey, I know. I bought my first car in 1982. I paid 17.5 percent on my car loan.

But the absolute highs of the 1980s, or historical averages, are not that relevant. More relevant is the absolute change.

Interest rates, in fact, have risen farther and faster than in the 1980s, When the late Fed Chairman Paul Volcker began his campaign to squeeze inflation from the economy, mortgage rates averaged about 11 percent, according to the government sponsored mortgage finance company Freddie Mac.

They peaked two years later near 19 percent — about 75 percent higher. In comparison, mortgage rates have more than doubled since the beginning of the year.

When an economy has run on rock-bottom interest rates for more than a decade, the sudden shift to high or higher rate environment is likely to mean wrenching adjustments. And no sector is likely to feel it more than the housing sector.

Home sales are falling, in Houston and across the country. National home prices in July had their first monthly decline in a decade, according to the widely respected Case-Shiller index. Housing starts fell 10 percent in August from July and 14 percent from August 2021, according to the Commerce Department.

MANUFACTURING: Growth picks up even as demand weakens in the face of recession fears

Mortgage applications are at a 22-year low, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.

The happy talk from the real estate industry is that the market is returning to normal, that much needed balance between buyers and sellers is being restored, and prices are going to continue to rise, albeit more slowly. In other words, it’s still a good time to buy.

I’m skeptical. In the 1980s in New England, real estate agents assured me that the booming real estate market was not a bubble. By the end of the decade, New England experienced a real estate bust comparable to national crash that started in 2006.

Speaking of 2006, I remember talking with a very smart economist then who flagged the rapid growth in subprime lending as something to worry about. Such lending practices had never been tested by a downturn, and he wasn’t so sure they would hold up.

When I raised this issue with real estate agents, they dismissed it. Subprime was just a tiny slice of the housing market, they said, too small to have much on impact on the broader market.

Maybe this time is different, and tight supplies, improved lending standards and historically reasonable mortgage rates will mean just a correction in housing, not a bust.

But it’s hard to believe that we won’t see layoffs in the construction and mortgage finance industries and other sectors related to housing. The point being that even if we don’t technically tip into a recession, it’s going feel like one for a lot of people."

""So I think the idea that it's going to be a really mild recession, if that, would be lucky. I'd say it's going to be a tough trade-off for the Fed once the numbers start setting in.""

For months, investors have been pricing in the risk of recession in 2023 as the Federal Reserve continues on its mission to stomp out inflation by forcefully jacking up interest rates, which has set the pace for fellow central banks to do the same. That mission was reinforced in the past week by the hawkish commentary from various Fed officials including Fed Chair Jerome Powell, Vice Chair Lael Brainard, and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari.

The hawkish tone from the Fed has rippled across an array of asset markets, from the surging U.S. dollar to rising mortgage rates that are nearing 7%.

Despite impressive rallies in the first two trading days of October, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), S&P 500 (^GSPC), and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) remain mired in double-digit percentage declines for the year. Emerging markets remain under considerable pressure too as investors wait for the next shoe to drop from central bankers.

The Fed’s ""long-lagged effects hit the markets very quickly,"" Rogoff explained. ""But [for] things like employment, the peak effects can be a year off. So it's one of the things that makes it so hard for the Fed to get to a soft or soft-ish landing, which I'm pretty skeptical about.""

Rising interest rates have also begun to factor into outlooks from corporate America, notably large multinationals such as Nike (NKE) and FedEx (FDX), that are exposed to currency market volatility.

And as growth slows, layoffs in the tech industry and others have started to emerge. Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas found that U.S.-based employers announced 29,989 job cuts in September, up 46.4% from August.

Given the volatile backdrop, Rogoff didn't rule out a tougher-than-expected recession in the U.S.

""I think it could be pretty brutal if the Fed really is hell-bent on having inflation come down as quickly as possible to 2% or 2.5%,"" he said. ""We have Europe very likely going to recession, China in at least a growth recession by all measures, ... that's a lot of pressures on us.""

“US recession now!” doesn’t really seem like the most obvious rallying cry for emerging economies. Yet the fact is that a US recession may well be what’s needed to make room for a reliable decline in real US interest rates, and a reliable weakening of the dollar.

And that loosening of US monetary conditions would certainly do some good for emerging economies now. The recent tightening of those conditions has had some pretty awful consequences for them. It has eroded their access to international capital markets; increased the risk of debt default, especially for low-income countries; and destabilised their currencies, pushing price stability even further from the grasp of even the most adept central bank.

The idea that capital flows will return to emerging markets in the wake of a US recession has some history to back it up. Two episodes are especially worth considering: the early 1990s and the aftermath of the global financial crisis in 2008.

The US experienced recessions from 1990 and from 2007 that lasted eight months and 18 months respectively. Both these episodes allowed a meaningful loosening of US monetary conditions, which helped trigger capital inflows to emerging economies after a period of risk aversion that was not unlike what we’ve been through recently.

By 1992, for example, international capital markets supplied net lending to emerging economies to the tune of about 1 per cent of GDP after nearly 10 years of taking money away from them. By 2010, that flow had risen to 2 per cent of GDP after two barren years when the Lehman crisis and its aftermath unfolded.

It has to be said that both these episodes ended badly: the rise in capital flows in the early 1990s came to an abrupt halt with Mexico’s Tequila Crisis in late 1994. And the post-financial crisis boom in capital inflows ended in a series of bumps: a hefty sell-off in asset prices towards the end of 2011, and the “taper tantrum” starting in spring 2013 when the Federal Reserve triggered market turmoil by tightening monetary policy.

It is also true that these two “boom episodes” in capital flows to developing countries were not entirely the result of a loosening in US financial conditions, since there were other factors at play.

Such a loosening is best understood as a “push” factor for capital flows: investors want to seek higher yields from developing countries when US rates are low and when the dollar’s value is declining.

But “pull” factors are also relevant. You can think of these as the growth potential of emerging economies, the effort that their policymakers put into encouraging inflows of long-term investment capital and the overall confidence that market participants have that “things are looking OK” for the developing world.

Looking back at those two historical episodes mentioned above, it is worth pointing out that on both occasions the “pull” factors were pretty strong.

In the early 1990s, EMs benefited from investors’ excitement about the proposed benefits of globalisation and the effort that countries — Mexico, Turkey, Thailand and the like — were making to reduce trade barriers, integrate themselves in the global economy, cut budget deficits and reduce inflation.

In addition, since the early 1990s, a number of countries had benefited from debt reduction under the Brady initiative. So EMs’ balance sheets were perceived to be cleaner than they had been in the crisis period of the 1980s.

Equally, the post-financial crisis environment also saw a substantial EM “pull” factor. Emerging economies were relatively unscathed by the crisis, while growth expectations were supported by the late-2008 decision by China to launch a huge programme of stimulus, which reinjected life into global commodity prices and global trade growth.

Strong EM “pull” factors are difficult to point to these days. Global trade growth is weak, which harms developing countries disproportionately. Protectionism is rising while geopolitical tensions threaten globalisation. And there is little evidence of growth-enhancing domestic economic reforms — with exceptions such as Indonesia or Vietnam.

So it likely that “push” factors will be important in determining capital flows to EMs. The trick will be to make sure that any post-US recession boom in such flows doesn’t, as in the past, turn to bust."

158eebfe-245b-4059-b0c4-5bc740c31892,"© Reuters Oil Up Again But in Slower Advance Before U.S. Jobs Report

By Barani Krishnan

Investing.com -- Oil rallied for a fourth day in a row after a production cut announced by OPEC+. But the market’s advance slowed as the dollar and bond yields remained robust ahead of Friday’s jobs report for September — which, depending on its strength, could result in another jumbo-sized rate hike by the Federal Reserve next month.

New York-traded West Texas Intermediate settled up 69 cents, or 0.8%, at $88.45 per barrel. For the week though, it was up almost 12% after running up four straight days since the start of October. WTI had fallen 12.5% in September and 24% in the third quarter.

Brent, the London-traded global benchmark for oil, settled up $1.05, or 1.1%, at $94.42 per barrel. For the week, Brent was up almost 8%, after an 11% drop in September and third-quarter loss of 22%.

Economists are expecting the Labor Department to report 250,000 new jobs in its September non-farm payrolls report. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.7% while wage growth is forecast to remain elevated.

Investors are assessing the likelihood of another 75 basis-point rate hike at the Fed’s November meeting. The Fed’s policy rate is now in the 3.00%-3.25% range, a full 3 percentage points higher than where it was at the start of 2022.

Charles Evan, president of the Chicago Fed, affirmed on Thursday the central bank’s target of adding another 125 basis points to rates by the year-end. “The next meeting will decide whether to use 50 or 75 basis points,” Evans said, referring to the Nov. 2 meeting of the FOMC, the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee of the Fed.

Rate hikes are anathema to markets, and any rally in the dollar, especially, tends to hurt demand for dollar-denominated commodities such as crude from buyers using other currencies.

“A strong dollar is capping crude’s gains today and it looks like we could see crude continue to consolidate until tomorrow’s NFP report,” said Ed Moya, analyst at online trading platform OANDA.

The Dollar Index, which pits the greenback against the euro, yen, pound, Canadian dollar, Swedish krona and Swiss franc, rose for a second day in a row Thursday, showing signs of reprising recent 20-year highs if Friday’s job numbers turn out to be as robust as expected.

The benchmark 10-year Treasury note was also up, egging the dollar higher.

Oil prices jumped on Wednesday as OPEC+ announced what was billed as a “deep” production cut, although the so-called reduction of 2 million barrels per day was even below the 3.5-million-barrel daily shortfall in the group’s previously announced output target."
52a6b67d-69ec-4214-8fd8-cd4eb9a64279,"The world’s largest economies are either in a recession, or they seem to be getting awfully close to one.

For weeks, the World Trade Organization and the World Bank have warned that a global recession is now likelier than ever. Economic growth forecasts have soured, and rising inflation is forcing central banks worldwide to tighten financial conditions and slow down their economies, threatening to tip many countries into a recession.

But the argument about whether or not a global economic contraction is in the cards may already be dated, according to Jonathan Garner, chief Asia and emerging market strategist at Morgan Stanley. He argues that recession chances are already assured in China, Europe, and the U.S., and the remaining questions are about when economic contractions will start, and how bad they will be.

“This debate to some extent is over. We are in some kind of a global recession as of the third quarter,” Garner told Bloomberg on Sunday.

“The question is, how do we get out of it through the course of next year?”

China is already in a recession

A global recession will hit economies at different times and with different consequences.

China, for instance, has likely been in a recession for “some considerable time,” Garner said, citing the country’s rising unemployment numbers. While a recession in most Western countries is likely to be triggered by how governments have raised interest rates to respond to soaring inflation, China’s annual inflation rate has been relatively low at 2.5% last month.

But strict COVID-19 policies and frequent lockdowns this year in the country’s manufacturing hubs have led to a significant drop in the country’s economic outlook for next year. The World Bank last month projected Chinese GDP growth to slow to 2.8% this year, down from 8.1% in 2021. The organization expects even slower growth next year, largely owing to ongoing efforts to contain COVID-19.

For a country that has posted annual GDP growth over 7% for most of the past 10 years, such a slowdown could make China “feel like it is in recession,” economist and president of Queens’ College, Cambridge Mohamed El-Erian said in September.

The souring view on the economy is already hitting the labor market, a clear recessionary signal, according to Garner. Youth unemployment in China is now at nearly 20%, and sentiment toward job prospects has declined to its lowest level since 2010, according to a survey released last week by China’s central bank, which found that fewer than 10% of Chinese workers were finding it easy to get a job in the current market.

Different recession types

While China may already be in a recession, the picture in the West is cloudier.

A recession probably hasn’t started yet in the U.S., Garner said, but across the ocean, the European Union and its 27 member countries are collectively “going into a recession.”

In June of this year, Morgan Stanley analysts forecasted a recession to hit the eurozone by the end of 2022, while other banks including J.P. Morgan have made similar predictions. Analysts blame Europe’s economic forecast on the continent’s mounting energy crisis, which has largely been caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and its effects on global energy supply.

Limited energy supply and high prices are already causing industrial and economic activity to slow down, which Goldman Sachs analysts warned last month could lead to a wave of unemployment and a potentially long recession sweeping the continent.

A European recession may have already begun months ago, analysts from economic consultancy firm Pantheon Macroeconomics said in August. Even in the U.K., a “moderate” recession may have started during the second quarter of this year, S&P Global Ratings predicted last month.

In the U.S., meanwhile, a full-blown recession has become less of a guarantee, and any economic contraction might be relatively limited to certain sectors, Garner said.

The main arbiter of when recessions begin and end in the U.S. is the private National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). The NBER has yet to officially call a U.S. recession, although one may have already begun. The common rule of thumb in determining when a recession starts in the U.S. is if GDP declines for two consecutive economic quarters, something that happened in July.

“Some parts of the U.S. economy have moved into recession,” Garner said, emphasizing the dangers the U.S. tech industry faces.

Tech companies were among the first and worst hit when the stock market took a plunge earlier this year, and have barely been able to recover since. And while the U.S. labor market has so far remained relatively robust despite recession fears, tech companies including Netflix and Snapchat parent Snap have already been forced into layoffs, with many more companies freezing hiring and reducing expenses."

US stocks kicked off October with strong gains as all major market indices jumped over 2%.

The surge came amid a decline in the US dollar and a slide lower in bond yields.

The rally was initially sparked by the UK government's reversal of its tax-cut proposal.

US stocks soared on Monday, kicking off the new quarter with a near 3% gain for all three major market indices. The Dow Jones surged more than 800 points.

The gains came amid a slide in the US dollar, which fell about one quarter of a percent, as well as a sizable decline in bond yields. The initial rally was sparked by the UK government's about face on its controversial tax cut and fiscal stimulus plans.

UK finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng confirmed reports that the newly installed government, under Prime Minister Liz Truss, would abandon its planned tax cuts for the top earners. Investors had grown increasingly worried about the unfunded tax cuts and the potential implications for already elevated inflation.

""The first major U-turn within the first month of rule isn't exactly an encouraging start for Liz Truss' government,"" City Index analyst Fiona Cincotta said. ""The move could potentially limit gains in sterling as the market frets over the government's ability to ride this storm out in a coherent manner.""

Here's where US indexes stood at the 4:00 p.m. ET close on Monday:

Here's what else was happening today:

In commodities, bonds and crypto:

West Texas Intermediate crude oil jumped 4.79% to $83.30 per barrel. Brent crude, oil's international benchmark, rose 4.24% to $88.75.

Gold rallied 2.08% to $1,706.80 per ounce.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell 17 basis points to 3.66%.

Bitcoin rose 1.85% to $19,519, while ether jumped 1.86% to $1,315."
8fa8ab9f-b1c2-4564-af5c-36a148fbcaaa,"Chicago Fed president Charles Evans reiterated that the US benchmark rate will peak at a range of 4.5 per cent to 4.75 per cent, in line with market pricing for a peak of 4.5 per cent by March 2023.

Minneapolis Fed’s Neel Kashkari said the central bank is “quite a way away” from pausing its campaign of rate increases and Cleveland Fed chief Loretta Mester noted the US is in an unacceptably high inflation environment.

“Ongoing hawkish comments by Fed officials [are] a clear pushback on the ‘Fed will pivot’ narrative that has supported risk assets since the beginning of the week,” said Tapas Strickland, head of market economics at National Australia Bank.

Bank of Canada governor Tiff Macklem sent a similarly hawkish message, saying that further tightening is needed to ensure price pressures don’t become entrenched in the economy.

“Simply put, there is more to be done,” Macklem told the Halifax Chamber of Commerce. Inflation will “not fade away by itself.”

Canada’s two-year bond yields jumped to the highest level since 2007 on his remarks, rising more than 7 basis points to nearly 4 per cent.

“This puts the Bank of Canada firmly in the camp of the hawkish Reserve Bank of New Zealand and US Federal Reserve and leaves the Reserve Bank’s downshift as a potential outlier,” Mr Strickland said.

Fears of central banks tightening too much intensified after the International Monetary Fund warned that countries accounting for about a third of the global economy will experience a recession, or at least two consecutive quarters of contraction, this year or next.

The IMF signalled that it will downgrade its global growth forecasts for the fourth consecutive quarter next week. The lender projects economic growth of just 3.2 per cent in 2022 and 2.9 per cent in 2023.

Nervous wait

Markets will closely watch the release of US labour data tonight which is expected to show that employers added another 250,000 jobs last month, marking the smallest increase so far in 2022.

The unemployment rate is projected to hold at a near five-decade low of 3.7 per cent.

“A surprise on the tighter side will only reinforce expectations that the Fed is indeed a way from target,” ANZ economists said.

The US Labor Department reported on Thursday that initial claims for jobless benefits came in at 219,000 for the week ended October 1, higher than economists’ expectations of 203,000.

Oil prices extended their advance after the OPEC+ alliance announced its largest production cut since 2020, adding to anxiety about stubborn inflationary pressures.

West Texas Intermediate topped $US88 a barrel after jumping 10 per cent over the previous three sessions, and Brent crude traded near $US95 barrel.

ANZ said it sees crude oil pushing back towards $US100 a barrel in the near term, and reiterated its short-term forecast of $US115 a barrel.

“OPEC’s move to cut oil production could be a turning point for the market,” said Daniel Hynes, senior commodity strategist at ANZ. “Market sentiment was already bearish in anticipation of a weakening global economy, and this decision should further tighten the market.”"
4ba20977-003f-4cb4-a84d-e10ddd6a191a,"Wall Street has fallen sharply following a solid jobs report for September that increased the likelihood the Federal Reserve will barrel ahead with an interest rate hiking campaign many investors fear will push the US economy into a recession.

The Labor Department reported the unemployment rate fell to 3.5 per cent, lower than expectations of 3.7 per cent, in an economy that continues to show resilience despite the Fed's efforts to bring down high inflation by weakening growth.

Non-farm payrolls rose by 263,000 jobs, more than the 250,000 figure economists polled by Reuters had forecast. Money markets raised to 92 per cent the probability of a fourth straight 75 basis-point rate hike when Fed policymakers meet on Nov. 1-2, up from 83.4 per cent before the data.

The job gains, lower unemployment rate and continued healthy wage growth point to a labour market Fed officials will likely still see as keeping inflation too high.

In the latest of the hawkish messages by policymakers, New York Fed president John Williams said more rate hikes were needed to tackle inflation in a process that will likely increase unemployment.

Friday's data cemented another jumbo, 75 basis-point rate hike in November as ""the labour market is still way too hot for the Fed's comfort zone"", said Bill Sterling, global strategist at GW&K Investment Management.

""This was a classic case of good news is bad news,"" he said. ""The market took the good news of the robust labour market report and turned it into an ever-more vigilant Fed and therefore potentially higher risks of a recession next year.""

Next week's consumer price index will provide a key snapshot of where inflation stands.

Despite Friday's nosedive, a hefty two-day rally earlier in the week pushed the S&P 500, the Dow and the Nasdaq to post their first week of gains after three straight weeks of losses.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 630.15 points, or 2.11 per cent, at 29,296.79, the S&P 500 lost 104.86 points, or 2.80 per cent, to 3,639.66 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 420.91 points, or 3.8 per cent, to 10,652.41.

For the week, the S&P 500 rose 1.51 per cent,the Dow added 1.99 per cent and the Nasdaq gained 0.73 per cent.

All 11 major S&P 500 sectors declined, with technology falling the most, down 4.14 per cent.

The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index fell 6.06 per cent after a revenue warning from Advanced Micro Devices signalled a chip slump could be worse than expected. The index posted its biggest single-day percentage decline in more than three weeks.

AMD shares fell 13.9 per cent as the company's third-quarter revenue estimates were about $US1 billion lower than previously forecast. It was the largest declining stock on the Nasdaq 100.

FedEx Corp slid 0.5 per cent on reports the division that handles most e-commerce deliveries expects customers to ship fewer holiday packages."

[Click here to read what's moving markets on Monday, Oct. 10]

The U.S. economy added 263,000 jobs last month as the unemployment rate fell to 3.5%. Economists expected a payroll gain of 255,000 and for unemployment to hold at 3.7%, per consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) plunged 2.8%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) shed 630 points, or 2.1%. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the way down at a decline oof 3.8%. Meanwhile in the bond market, Treasury yields spiked, with the benchmark 10-year note back near 3.9% and the rate-sensitive 2-year yield topping 4.3%.

Friday's sell-off pared much of the week's gains after a fleeting two-day rally that kicked off the month lifted all three major averages more than 5% off their 2022 lows. Still, U.S. stocks managed to end the week on a positive note, snapping a three-week losing streak. The S&P 500 was up 1.5%, the Dow 2%, and the Nasdaq 0.7% since Monday.

""The market’s negative reaction may be a sign that investors are processing the likelihood that there will be no change in the Fed’s aggressive playbook in the near term,"" Mike Loewengart, head of model portfolio construction at Morgan Stanley's Global Investment Office, said in a note. ""Keep in mind the next Fed decision isn’t until early November, so much more data will need to be digested, not the least of which is next week’s inflation gauge.""

Investors were betting that signs of a cooling labor market would force Federal Reserve policymakers to change course on their aggressive rate-hiking path, particularly after a series of weaker economic releases showed a sharp contraction in manufacturing activity and fewer job openings. But many Wall Street strategists have argued that hopes of an imminent pivot are premature, a sentiment that this jobs report appears to reinforce.

Story continues

In recent research notes, JPMorgan analysts said that equity bulls would need a monthly payroll print as low as 100,000 to see the market alter its Fed expectations, while analysts at Bank of America said a pivot won’t occur “until payrolls sting.”

“The Fed's job is still far from over: expect hikes to continue until negative payrolls are almost in hand,” a team at BofA led by rates research strategist Meghan Swiber noted.

Moreover, Federal Reserve officials themselves have delivered clear messaging in recent weeks that there are so far no plans to retreat from aggressive policy intervention.

""We have further to go,"" Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans said Thursday, indicating the benchmark rate will likely be at 4.5% to 4.75% by the spring of 2023. """"Inflation is high right now and we need a more restrictive setting of monetary policy.""

U.S. crude oil futures continued this week’s climb on the heels of the heftiest OPEC+ production cut since 2020. DataTrek Research noted that West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude at more than $85 per barrel will prolong positive energy inflation trends until at least the start of 2023. The firm also noted that oil prices are an “underappreciated fulcrum issue” for the Federal Reserve and the market’s expectations of near-term economic growth.

WTI futures (CL=F) settled at $92.65 per barrel on Friday, marking a 17% jump since Monday — the largest one-week increase since Russia's invasion of Ukraine began earlier this year.

Elsewhere in markets, chipmakers were under pressure Friday after Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) lowered its third-quarter revenue guidance and warned of “significant” inventory corrections across the PC supply chain. Shares tanked nearly 14% to cap Friday's session. Also weighing on the sector was Samsung reporting its first profit decline since 2019, another sign of a troubled chip market.

Levi Strauss (LEVI) was also a mover Friday after the retailer cut its guidance, citing headwinds from a stronger dollar, slowing consumer demand and persistent supply chain snafus. The stock closed down roughly 12%.

Meanwhile, shares of DraftKing (DKING) ended up 3% after Bloomberg News reported Thursday that ESPN is nearing a large new partnership deal with the sports-betting company, citing sources familiar with the agreement.

The pound (GBPUSD=X) reversed gains against the dollar, sliding on Friday as traders anticipate further interest rate rises following the US jobs report.

Markets are betting that the Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates for longer and the Bank of England os expected to follow suit.

Non-farm payrolls increased by 263,000 in September, compared to a consensus estimate of around 250,000, whereas in August hirings rose by 315,000. The unemployment rate came in at 3.5%.

""Those hoping for a Fed pivot have been sorely disappointed with today’s job numbers, which have confirmed that US economy continues to rumble along quite well,"" Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading platform IG said.

""The latest bear market bounce has now begun to wilt as investors wearily return to expectations of at least 125bps of tightening by the end of the year, with more to come in 2023.""

Sterling was down 0.5% at $1.111 at the time of writing, and 0.3% lower against the euro (GBPEUR=X) at €1.1381. It also comes as the euro (EURUSD=X) is edging back towards parity with the dollar at 98 cents.

On Wednesday, ratings agency Fitch downgraded the government debt rating to ""negative"" from ""stable"" in the wake of the mini-budget.

It warned that the ""large and unfunded fiscal package"" could lead to a significant increase in the government’s deficits over the medium term.

""The large and unfunded fiscal package announced as part of the new government's growth plan could lead to a significant increase in fiscal deficits over the medium term,"" Fitch said.

The government plans to borrow £43bn in an effort to boost UK growth.

Fitch also cautioned that Britain's economy will shrink in 2023, despite prime minister Liz Truss and chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's mini-budget.

The ratings agency expects the general government deficit to reach 7.8% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2022 and 8.8% next year, and general government debt to jump to 109% of GDP by 2024.

The slump in the British pound, spurred by concerns about borrowing costs, has raised fresh fears about the impact on wider markets.

On Friday, new figures from Halifax showed the UK property market is cooling as house prices fell 0.1% last month to average £293,835.

The lender warned that the recent surge in mortgage costs is likely to put more pressure on the market.

""Stamp duty cuts, the short supply of homes for sale and a strong labour market all support house prices, the prospect of interest rates continuing to rise sharply amid the cost of living squeeze, plus the impact in recent weeks of higher mortgage borrowing costs on affordability, are likely to exert more significant downward pressure on house prices in the months ahead,"" Kim Kinnaird, director of Halifax Mortgages said.

7e514fa4-c8bb-4022-b23c-6a8f275a71e5,"Key economic data hits the tape this morning, at a time when pre-market traders were in a mood to give back a good slice of the gains they’d accrued over the past two sessions. But the data, which came in pretty much in-line, does not look to have moved the needle much: we’re still angling to open in the red, after market participants have gauged the near-term levels of overall increases over the past two sessions.

The private-sector payroll report from Automatic Data Processing ADP this morning was slightly above consensus: 208K versus 200K expected. This is also notably higher than the previous month’s 185K new hires. That previous month’s tally was the lowest of the cycle; today’s is second-lowest. From October last year through June 2022, we were 300K+ each month; this new development is actually good news for the Fed in deciding future interest rates.

The strongest gainer by sector last month was Trade/Transportation/Utilities, which takes out the usual suspects Leisure/Hospitality and Professional/Business Services sectors. While the Fed may have preferred to see an even lower overall private-sector jobs number, where we are is fairly Goldilocks for the economy at large, independent of the next Fed move. Information Services and Financials brought up the rear in terms of quarterly jobs.

We also get a new International Trade Balance for August, which came in at -$67.4 billion, slightly improved from the expected $67.7 billion, and notably better than the -$70.5 billion posted last time around. Today’s headline gives us the best trade deficit figures since May’s -$66.6 billion. Obviously, this is still a deep chasm; what’s nice about it is we’re coming at least a little closer to a manageable deficit figure.

After today’s open, S&P Global PMI and ISM Services results will come out, with 49.2 and 56.0% expected, respectively. This shows a fork in the road for current Services business: one above and one lower than the 50 mark. What we ought to glean from this is that businesses in the Services sector are still fighting post-pandemic headwinds; the good news here is there is next to no reliance on foreign markets, at least compared to Manufacturing.

The latest twice-yearly Brookings-Financial Times tracking index found that growth momentum, as well as financial market and confidence indicators, had deteriorated markedly in recent months as soaring prices and geopolitical uncertainty fuel lead economic pessimism cross the world’s major economies.

Confidence indicators have fallen sharply and are at all-time lows since the index began over a decade ago in countries including the US, UK and China. In emerging economies, which are more exposed to rising food and energy prices, confidence has fallen even more sharply.

The United Nations last week warned that developing nations, in particular those in Asia, could bear the brunt as monetary and fiscal policies in advanced economies – including continued interest rate hikes – push the world toward a global recession and stagnation."

9fa9a636-a27d-444e-8246-27bdf04424ce,"Investors and Wall Street analysts are sounding the alarm about a possible “market accident”, as successive bouts of tumult in US stocks and bonds and a surging dollar cause rising levels of stress in the financial system.

A gauge of strain in US markets — produced by the Treasury’s Office of Financial Research — has soared to its highest level since the coronavirus pandemic ructions of May 2020.

Even as equities on Wall Street start the new quarter with gains, the OFR’s Financial Stress index is near a two-year high at 3.1, where zero denotes normal market functioning. That has added to a growing list of benchmarks which suggest trading conditions in US government debt, corporate bonds and money markets are increasingly stretched.

“The velocity of things breaking around the world . . . is obviously a ‘neon swan’ telling us that we are clearly now in the market accident stage,” said Charlie McElligott, a strategist at Nomura.

Rising concerns have been fuelled by a series of big interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve to curb inflation. Higher borrowing costs and fears of an economic slowdown have led a steep sell-off in public markets, while strengthening the US currency to the detriment of its global peers.

Rate rises by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England — as well as aborted tax plans by the UK government — have also amplified swings in the market this year as global policymakers attempt to rein in price growth.

“When financial conditions tighten this much, everyone is looking for who or what will be the cause for central banks to blink,” said Michael Edwards, the deputy chief investment officer of hedge fund Weiss Multi-Strategy Advisers. “They [the Fed] are determined to get financial conditions tighter, and [because] the economy is very strong . . . they have to use funding markets as the transmission mechanism. So someone will get hurt.”

McElligott pointed to the 20 per cent slide in the Japanese yen this year, a sell-off in British sovereign debt in recent weeks, and a smattering of loans stuck on banks’ balance sheets that lenders are unable to offload to investors even with deep discounts, as signs of the strains in markets.

He added that the strength of the dollar was “causing tremendous strains economically . . . and increasingly, metastasising in markets”.

The stresses mean that markets are not operating as they should: companies aren’t easily able to obtain funding, it is harder to buy and sell securities, prices are volatile and investors are less willing to take on risk.

Conditions have been deteriorating all year, but until late it has been evident primarily in the stock market where valuations have dropped precipitously as borrowing costs have risen and the prospects of growth have been slashed.

Private companies have been unable to list their shares publicly and banks have had to withdraw planned debt financings for their clients after investors refused to open their cheque books.

Last month banks were forced to hold $6.5bn of debt to fund the buyout of software maker Citrix on their own balance sheets after they failed to find willing buyers for the entirety of the debt financing.

“This is a story about boiling lobsters. You put them in cold water and slowly turn the heat up,” said George Goncalves, head of US macro strategy at MUFG. “That is what is happening in markets. The Fed is turning up the heat. But because the market is still flush with liquidity, it’s not yet clear where the weakness is.”

JPMorgan Chase economist Bruce Kasman on Friday said that the relative health of the banking system and small financing needs for much of the corporate world meant the vulnerabilities to the financial system remained low. However, the US bank warned that the increase in the OFR’s index is evidence of the broader spread of stress throughout financial markets — and decreased appetite for risk — wrought by the strong dollar and higher US interest rates.

“Risks to global financial stability are an increasingly known unknown for the outlook,” Kasman said.

The corporate bond market is also showing increasing signs of strain, according to Marty Fridson, chief investment officer at Lehmann, Livian, Fridson Advisors.

Fridson noted that the premium investors demanded to hold risky, junk-rated corporate debt over haven Treasuries has increased significantly over the past month. By his calculations, the junk bond market now reflects a 22 per cent chance of recession, up from just 2 per cent in mid-September.

Corporate defaults more than doubled from July to August, according to rating agency Moody’s. Strategists with Bank of America warned on Friday that their gauge measuring stress in the credit market was at a “borderline critical level” and that “market dysfunction starts” if it rises much further.

Separately, a Goldman Sachs index that measures market impairments and dislocations is being driven higher by stress in funding markets as well as heightened volatility in the $24tn US government debt market.

The 10-year Treasury yield, which is a benchmark for borrowing costs worldwide, has risen this year from about 1.5 per cent to 3.6 per cent — and last week it briefly breached 4 per cent for the first time in 12 years.

Volatility in that market has also reached the highest level since the coronavirus-induced ructions of 2020, according to the Ice BofA Move index.

The volatility can also be seen on a day-to-day basis: the biggest move in the 10-year Treasury in 2021 was a 0.16 percentage point drop on November 26. There have been seven days so far this year with bigger moves.

While policymakers at the Fed remain steadfast in raising rates, they too are on the lookout for potential dangers from the market drawdown.

“As monetary policy tightens globally to combat high inflation, it is important to consider how cross-border spillovers and spillbacks might interact with financial vulnerabilities,” Lael Brainard, the Fed’s vice-chair, said on Friday. “We are attentive to financial vulnerabilities that could be exacerbated by the advent of additional adverse shocks.”"

These days, the global economy is about as anxious as Herschel Walker’s PR team.

Last week, a hiccup in the investment strategy of British pension funds nearly tanked the U.K. Treasury market, and sent ripples of financial panic across the Atlantic. In Europe, consumers are bracing for a cold winter as natural-gas supplies run scarce. In the most unfortunate developing countries, blackouts and food shortages are proliferating. In China — long the engine of global growth — economic activity is bogged down by zero-COVID policies and a giant real-estate bubble. Policymakers the world over are wringing their hands over the prospect of a worldwide recession.

Nevertheless, for now, widespread inflation persists. And the Federal Reserve remains committed to raising interest rates, even as major Wall Street banks warn that further hikes just might break the financial system’s fragile “plumbing.”

To make sense of our economy’s present — and assess the prospects for its future — I reached out to an expert on its past. Adam Tooze is among the world’s most prominent economic historians and prolific Substack commentators. He’s authored celebrated books on each of the world’s last two financial crises. We spoke about the inequities and instabilities of the existing financial system, the class politics of monetary policy, and why progressives should support the construction of new gas pipelines in the United States (for global justice’s sake).

What’s your nutshell summary of what’s been going wrong with the global economy in general, and global financial markets in particular?

In the real economy, the situation is actually finely balanced right now. The real stress is in the energy-supply system to certain parts of the world, notably Europe. But in the U.S., the real economy is still, at this point, not in crisis mode. There are some signs of a downturn, notably in the real-estate market. But in a sense, part of the problem is that the real economy is not slowing as fast as the Fed would like.

And that’s an issue because, of course, inflation soared to levels that people did not anticipate. So the Fed raised interest rates to counter inflation. And then the highly leveraged financial system, which had grown accustomed to more or less continuous support from the Fed since 2008, realized that such support was truly over: Given inflationary pressure, the Fed was actually going to persist with rate hikes this time. And that, since the spring, has sent a shock through financial markets from which they’ve not recovered.

Over the summer, there was some hope that equity markets might rebound. One never knows with stock markets but, in the last month or so, the mood seems to have significantly darkened. A recession is one thing; we’re not in one yet, but we could be headed in that direction. A fall in stock-market prices is another thing. Stocks are supposed to fall when the economy slows down. It’s the proper thing for them to do, since they reflect profit expectations. Painful but hydraulically necessary. The real worry is that something’s going to break.

Like Britain’s pension funds last week.

Yes. At first I pooh-poohed its significance, because I was in my Britain-hating mode. I thought that the U.K. Treasury market was too small to matter. But it’s been interpreted as a sign of how things can break down more broadly.

And what happened in Britain, to oversimplify is: Swiftly rising interest rates — prompted by the government’s tax-cut plan — exposed a vulnerability in pension funds’ investment strategy. And that, in turn, forced the pension funds to sell off their British Treasury bonds for cash, which pushed interest rates up further still, which exacerbated the problem in their investment strategy, which forced them to sell off more bonds, in a vicious cycle. Yeah?

Basically. And what the central bank was then forced to do in a hurry was to step back in and stabilize this system by buying up bonds. And that’s a problem. Because it’s contradictory.

Because the Bank of England is supposed to be fighting inflation by selling U.K. Treasury bonds.

And raising rates, yes. But here it was taking action that did the opposite. It got caught between doing what was necessary to stabilize inflation and doing what was necessary to stabilize the financial system. In that moment, it could not do both. When a central bank reaches that kind of impasse, then people get nervous.

And that’s where we’re at now. The worry is that there could be something in the U.S. financial system that could break too. We don’t know quite what it is. Now, we’ve been worrying about this for some time. So there is an element of crying wolf here. But if you wanted to dig into it, you’d start with the U.S. Treasury market and how poor liquidity has been there for the last couple of months.

So, to be clear, there’s two different kinds of worries. One is about “something breaking” in the sense of a 2008-style meltdown of the financial system. And I think there, the optimistic case is that we’re no longer in a world where that can happen; under the current system, central banks will simply do whatever’s necessary to plug the relevant holes. But then there’s the second worry that — even if the Fed can rescue the financial system from a crisis — it can’t simultaneously fight a financial crisis and inflation.

That’s the kind of dilemma which we might be impaled upon. I mean, obviously, we shouldn’t allow that to sit for very long because if the issue is financial stability, the answer is reform of financial structure.

If things do start to break, structural reform of the U.S. Treasury market should go way up the agenda, which is where it should have been really since at least the spring of 2020. It has actually been quite a while since we had a year in which there wasn’t anxiety about the Treasury market. Which is a problem, since the U.S. Treasury market is gigantic and, at least notionally, the platform of stability for all other private finance. Yet it no longer seems to have the stability properties that it’s supposed to.

What would structural reform of the Treasury market look like?

Start with transparency. We clearly don’t know enough. We’re still doing postmortems on who sold what where in the spring of 2020. That’s the place to start. And then you would want to look at the way in which the market is organized, and the key role played by a very small number of players, most notably J.P. Morgan, which anchors that entire market. And we need to think about whether it’s appropriate for a market of that significance to run through so few private hands. Because it puts them in a very dangerous position when things get rough, so it’s not really a function that a private balance sheet ought to be managing.

In concrete terms, what are the costs of the system as it’s currently arranged? Who loses out from an arrangement where private actors organize these markets in good times, while central banks stabilize them in bad ones? So long as the second part happens, at first glance, it can look like nothing is lost. Things got hairy for a minute in Britain last week. But no one actually lost their pension. Conditions returned to normal.

That’s a very important question. One shouldn’t confuse balance-sheet interventions with bailouts in the classic sense; no one’s taking a risky stake in anyone else’s business. But what the central banks are facilitating is highly leveraged profit-making by private actors. So it’s more, “Why do we subsidize this activity?” rather than, “Why do we bail them out?”

What we are really asking ourselves is: Why do we have a system that enables private actors to make huge profits in good times, and then in bad times, provides them with a safety net so that they never actually have to face the consequences of their own risk-taking? The major negative side effect of this is the volatility of interest rates to which regular citizens are exposed. And in the British case, this is making itself felt very dramatically in the shock to mortgage interest rates. In the U.K., everyone’s on flexible mortgages and those are all adjusting.

So if you have a crisis like this, if you have a shock — if you have a panic and interest rates surge — then the central bank can step in to prevent anyone going bankrupt in the private financial system. But in the meantime, interest rates have shot up and delivered a really painful shock to the housing market. And that’s when ordinary people begin to “feel the pain.”

Now, you could defend the system. In the U.K. example, you could say, “Well these are pension funds that we’re talking about. The central bank is just enabling the pension funds to manage the inherently problematic business of providing pension insurance to people, which is difficult to do because we don’t really know what the risks are going to be over 30 years.”

But the follow-on point is: Whose pensions are we talking about? And essentially, they are gold-plated, defined-benefit private-insurance schemes for the top 10 to one percent of the British population. So one could wonder, Why do we maintain a pension system that’s structured like this? In which essentially, a pension fund chases yield very aggressively because they are struggling to make this particular part of the upper-middle-class welfare state work.

So there is a wider entanglement here. Regular citizens are not just victims of this process in the same way as they were not just victims of the mortgage boom of 2007 and 2008. I mean, it was petty bourgeois middle-class speculation on multiple mortgages that drove some of the dodgier deals at the end phase of the housing boom.

If our system for managing financial stability is less-than-ideal, one might say the same of our system for managing inflation. To a layperson, the response of central banks to rising prices might seem paradoxical. On the one hand, the Fed argues that inflation is bad because it’s eroding the public’s living standards. On the other hand, it is pursuing policies whose deliberate consequence is an increase in unemployment, and a reduction of real wages and asset values; which is to say, a reduction in the public’s living standards. How does the Fed resolve that apparent contradiction?

There are a few different ways of doing so. One is that asset price inflation is itself part of the inflation process. So, genuine “copper-bottomed” conservatism is skeptical about asset price growth as well as inflation. It’s skeptical of the radical centrism that has prevailed since the 1990s, which seeks to repress inflation while promoting unlimited upside in equity markets. It considers that a degenerate form of conservatism because true conservatism understood that there was a relationship between broader inflation and rising asset prices; that the two things are really just part of the same phenomenon.

If you’re in that mode — and that is the mode that some central bankers are rediscovering — then there is no contradiction. Reducing wages and reducing asset values are part of the same process of returning the economy to some natural equilibrium. The point is to pop “bubbles” and restore the natural market balance. And once we’re back at that balance, the economy will grow in a more sustainable and ultimately more beneficial way.

The other argument is more straightforward, which is simply to say that inflation is bad, quashing it in the short run hurts, but we need to take some pain now to avoid more pain later. If inflation is allowed to build up in the system and become ingrained in it, then squeezing it out of the system later will be even more painful. And so take your medicine now so as to avoid the really radical surgery we’re going to have to do later on.

It seems to me that the whole left-right debate over inflation hinges on that claim. Progressives tend to oppose managing inflation by deliberately increasing unemployment as a matter of principle. They’re ideologically opposed to concentrating the burdens of economic adjustment on the most disempowered workers in our society — especially in a society with a safety net as threadbare as America’s. Conservatives and centrists generally disagree, but rarely in principle. They don’t argue that it’s good that the Fed’s approach to managing inflation requires increasing unemployment. But they insist that it’s a tragic necessity. Progressives might propose addressing inflation by increasing supply through public investment. But such interventions do not help in the immediate term; it takes a while to build stuff and bring it to market. And the left’s other primary proposal — simply ride out the inflation by waiting until supply grows to meet demand — also cannot immediately halt the inflation process. Which is a problem if inflation inevitably accelerates. If failing to act on inflation now means that it will accelerate to a point where only a severe recession can stop it, then jacking up interest rates to moderately increase unemployment might be the best of our bad options. It isn’t about class warfare. It’s just about pulling the one lever we have that works fast.

So, what do you make of that idea? Is it rooted primarily in empirical evidence, or in its convenience as an alibi for disciplining labor?

In the advanced economy world, the idea derives its authority overwhelmingly from one historical example, which is the 1970s. And it involves, to my mind, an entirely unconvincing claim that we still have the underlying political economy that would generate a wage-price spiral.

A circumstance where rising prices cause workers to demand higher wages, which forces firms to charger higher prices, which causes workers to demand higher wages, etc.

Right. And I think that political economy was destroyed when organized labor was disarmed in the 1980s and 1990s. That doesn’t mean that you can’t get some wage pressure. But I don’t think you can really get a full blown wage-price spiral if you don’t have collective actors. My view is basically that a progressive politics requires nerves of steel. It requires making the wager that we can ride out the current surge in prices.

Now, I’m not going to say that central banks shouldn’t raise interest rates at all. I’m not a Post-Keynesian fundamentalist on this. I’m not persuaded that price controls are an evidently better way of controlling inflation.

But yes, as you say, it’s a kind of wager or historic test between two underlying hypotheses. One is the conservative one: Unless we act quickly, we risk returning to 1970s-style inflation. And the other one is the progressive gamble, which is that we can afford to ride this out actually, because that 1970s political economy is — regrettably — no longer with us. In fact, we have a degree of leeway here. And having crushed the trade unions, we should be able to be kinder on the unemployment variable, at the very least.

But there’s another important element to factor in here. Although the fear of unemployment is quite general, the pain of actual unemployment falls on — in the worst case, “hard landing” scenario — 6 or 7 or 8 percent of the American workforce. The Fed thinks it could be capped at 4.5 to 5 percent. Now, that would be a big increase in unemployment. But it would also only impact about one in 20 people in the workforce. Whereas, a general increase in prices affects literally everyone. It impacts 20 times more people. So if the idea is, as it were, to maximize the benefit for the greatest number, then you can see why inflation control has a kind of overwhelming logic.

It was only the mechanisms of collective politics and the collective imaginary that came out of the Great Depression that turned unemployment into something more than just the fate of unfortunate people in the shittiest slots of the labor market. White-collar people, generally speaking, don’t experience unemployment for protracted periods of time. It really is a blue-collar and sub-blue-collar, unskilled workers’ experience. And in America, of course, it’s highly racialized; it is above all the experience of Black men.

When the Great Depression still loomed large in popular memory, it made sense to treat inflation and unemployment as equivalent problems. Unemployment was a mass tragedy that affected everyone, and so everyone should care about it as much as they care about inflation. In a sense, what we’ve discovered is that that’s not an empirically reasonable description of the unemployment problem in the current day. Because, it wasn’t ever really.

This speaks to concerns I’ve had about the politics of today’s inflation. In the left’s traditional paradigm, the class politics of monetary austerity are straightforward: It sacrifices the welfare of the many to that of the few, both by reducing labor’s bargaining power through higher unemployment, and by shoring up the financial interests of creditors while exacerbating the burdens of debtors. And yet, some of the financial industry’s most powerful actors — including BlackRock and Bank of America — are among the leading voices calling for the Fed to refrain from steep interest-rate hikes, for the sake of preserving financial stability and growth. And it’s quite plain that capital owners as a whole are not deriving much benefit from the current policy path, which has shaved $36 trillion off their collective asset values.

Meanwhile, at least in the U.S., it was not merely elites but the broad middle class who saw little worth celebrating in Biden’s hot economy. Even as the American worker enjoyed the most favorable labor market in decades, polling data found overwhelming disapproval of the economy. Indeed, popular discontent with economic conditions has been significantly higher than it was during much of the tepid recovery that followed the 2008 crash. So, it seems plausible to me that the revealed preference of the American middle class is for a slow-growth economy with moderately high unemployment, in which low-skill labor is hyper-exploitable — and thus, contractors are easy to find, gig workers are abundant, fast-food restaurants are all fully staffed, etc. If true, the implications seem somewhat bleak for the progressive project.

I think that’s a fantastic analysis, especially if we are clear that “middle class” is not a euphemism for working class. If we take “middle class” to mean what it says, then yes, I think that the “it’s so difficult to get good servants these days” problem is real. I think that’s a really nice way of formulating the problem, the fact that Uber doesn’t work anymore, these kinds of phenomena.

Separately, in the American context, energy prices are hugely salient. We know that the Michigan Consumer Survey Indices, which are often cited as an indicator of how dissatisfied people are, are heavily biased towards gas prices. And those skyrocketed. So that helped to damage consumer confidence. There’s clearly more going on than that though.

The resistance of the working class to inflation, properly understood, has to do with the fact that they’re in a weak position structurally. If you don’t have collective bargaining power, if you don’t have cost-of-living adjustment mechanisms, if you have very little reason to believe that collective action will actually yield much benefit, then you quite rationally fear inflation.

I spent some time in Argentina this year, which has 100 percent inflation. They’re remarkably sanguine about it because they know perfectly well that across the board, across a very wide range of sectors, wages will be fully adjusted at the end of the year with compensation. That’s just built into the system because of the power of collective action there.

By contrast, look at the real wage hits that workers have taken both in the U.S. and in Europe. There’s very little prospect of redress, in which case you do become hostage to the situation and desperate for the lid to be kept on. Which I agree is depressing. In the low-inflation era of the 2010s, I used to argue that we should aim for a 4 percent inflation target precisely because inflation of that kind provides workers with a gradual yet persistent incentive to organize.

And I think that logic is still sound. And the Bank of International Settlements actually openly argued that one of the reasons why central banks ought to stamp on the break in 2022 is that if this inflation is allowed to continue, it will in fact cause people to begin to try and organize themselves. Frankly, from my progressive political view, I think they may be too alarmist. There isn’t actually much evidence of that yet. But it’s theoretically sound.

It seems like we’re in a bind then where, if we don’t have strong collective-bargaining rights, then working-class voters will have little patience for inflation, even in cases where tolerating price increases might be in their enlightened long-term interest. But if we do have strong collective bargaining rights, then central bankers’ tolerance for inflation would be even lower than it is now.

Yes. As you were saying, the argument for hawkish monetary policy is all about avoiding a situation in which wages adjust rapidly to price increases.

You referenced American consumers’ hypersensitivity to energy prices. I know that you’ve been critical of the Biden administration’s efforts to increase the supply of fossil fuels on the world market. But some progressive analysts — who take climate change seriously — have made the case for increasing short-term fossil-fuel production in the U.S. I think the broad argument for their position has two parts.

First, there is the political argument: We are a long way from the point in the energy transition where fossil fuels are no longer essential to the functioning of the global economy. Renewable-heavy grids still generally rely on gas plants to compensate for their intermittency. The electric-vehicle revolution is in its infancy. And when we do reach the point where drivers in the global north have fully forfeited internal-combustion vehicles, those vehicles will be sold used in developing countries and driven there for another decade. Given these realities, reducing the supply of fossil fuels means, in the short term, increasing the price of energy — which is both the single most salient price to voting publics, and a driver of inflation in the cost of myriad manufactured goods. Therefore, a commitment to throttling fossil-fuel production undermines the left’s efforts to offer an alternative vision for controlling inflation. It puts progressives in the position of saying, “We shouldn’t reduce prices by throttling demand through interest-rate hikes. But we also shouldn’t reduce prices by increasing the supply of the commodity that you care about most.”

So, that’s the political argument. Separately, there is a substantive one: Limiting U.S. fossil-fuel exports does not necessarily reduce the carbon-intensity of energy use. In Europe and Asia, we’ve seen that a scarcity of natural gas has led to an increase in coal burning. Given that global demand for fossil energy isn’t going to disappear in the medium term, how do we know that reducing U.S. natural-gas exports won’t just lead to them being replaced by dirtier fossil fuels?

So, if the Biden administration had responded to the situation in 2022 by saying, “We need to focus on natural gas. We need to build out energy liquefaction and assist the Europeans in building off-take capacity,” then I think their position would have been perfectly defensible. Both of us know perfectly well that that’s not what it was about though, right?

They were trying to reduce the price of gasoline for American consumers at the pump and were willing to do practically goddamn anything to get that done. And all that does is reinforce the belief and expectation on the part of American consumers that they should expect that the full force of the American state will be used, even at the global level, to ensure that they get the ridiculously cheap gasoline that they’re used to. So that’s what my criticism centered on. It was about their meddling in OPEC policy and all of that. The distinction between oil and gasoline on the one hand, and natural gas on the other, has become more and more salient as the crisis of 2022 has gone on. What I think has become absolutely evident is that collectively, not just in Europe, but collectively, we have an interest in having a global gas market that works. And we currently don’t have an integrated global gas market.

And that’s because key elements of physical infrastructure are missing. We’re currently in a situation where the American natural-gas price is ridiculously low because it can’t be exported. There just isn’t the liquefaction capacity. So the fracking gas just circulates around the U.S. economy, and keeps America’s natural-gas prices ridiculously low by global standards.

Meanwhile, as energy prices began to surge all over the world last year, poor-country consumers of liquified natural gas found themselves squeezed out of the market altogether. And so, we don’t need to produce any more gas. We don’t need to expand gas production. What we need is a deeply integrated global gas market — not in the interest of subsidizing rich countries to go on doing what they’re doing, but in the interest of stabilizing energy costs in poor countries.

Having spent time now in India, the fury — that’s not the wrong word — at the hypocrisy of the European environmentalists over the issue of boycotting spending on gas infrastructure abroad is something to behold. I mean, it’s really fairly intense, especially now that the Europeans themselves are outbidding everyone else for the gas that they need. So I think the case for gas as a transition fuel is strong. The case for expanding gas production is not. The case for investing in gas infrastructure is, at this point, unanswerable.

So then, in your view, U.S. environmentalists are mistaken for opposing gas pipelines that facilitate exports? Because fundamentally, we need to build out such infrastructure if we’re going to have an equitable global gas market, in which Americans pay slightly more for energy, and the global poor pay much less?

The pipeline problem within the U.S. may matter to local environmentalist struggles and land rights and so on. But from a global point of view, they’re trivial. Build the pipeline some other way. But clearly, yes, in the interest of global balance, the resources of American gas need to be made available. It’s a bit like the reason why famines don’t happen anymore, right? If you have really integrated grain markets, you don’t get famines in the same way as you do if you have market disintegration.

If I understand you correctly, you’re saying that U.S. policymakers should not do anything to reduce gasoline prices for U.S. consumers, but should take actions that will increase the heating bills of their constituents (while benefiting natural-gas companies, which would gain access to a vastly larger market).

Yes. The upshot of all of this is that American gas prices have to triple probably. If you’re worried about the cost-of-living impact, we all know what to do, right? You just subsidize lower incomes. You don’t do it by manipulating the energy price.

I feel like it would be politically suicidal for the Democratic Party to unilaterally endorse increasing Americans’ energy costs. Although, I guess expanding natural-gas exports might not require much policy action.

Yeah. The price difference between the U.S. and global market is so gigantic that the pressure to build that liquefaction capacity is well-nigh irresistible. Insofar as political objections in the United States make it impossible to raise fossil-fuel prices — be it through carbon taxes or carbon markets or simply the operation of a global market for gas — well, let’s just say that all of the outcomes for the climate then are second- or third- or fourth-best.

Returning to the Fed: You’ve suggested that, just as America’s energy policies should take greater account of the global good, so should its monetary policy. And partly out of enlightened self-interest. Right now, when weighing the pros and cons of increasing interest rates, the Fed doesn’t put much weight on the ramification of rate hikes for foreign economies. But since the U.S. dollar is the world’s reserve currency, those implications are huge. Whenever America raises its interest rate, other nations need to raise their own or else see their currencies devalue, and thus, their inflation get worse. Meanwhile, as rising interest rates increase the dollar’s value, it becomes harder for emerging markets to keep up with their dollar-denominated debt payments. Which can produce debt crises. So, why doesn’t the Fed incorporate such risks into its analysis of the costs and benefits of rate hikes?

Fundamentally, on the record, they’re not going to say anything at all that contradicts the fact that they’re an American central bank and their job is to worry about the American economy. They have no mandate for global hegemony, and they’re only supposed to factor in the global effects of their policy to the extent that those effects reverberate to the U.S. economy. And that is manifestly the case with financial stability concerns. Like, if Credit Suisse does fail, that’s big news on Wall Street. So they have every reason to try and support the Swiss government in whatever support they might have to do for Credit Suisse. But, they have no mandate to consider the impact of interest-rate increases on Sri Lanka or India or Argentina. That’s just not their brief.

But there are ways that this stance could blowback on the U.S. economy. When the Americans hike, everyone else has to hike to keep their currency stable against the dollar. Which means that everyone squeezes their economy simultaneously. And then what you get is a ripple effect whereby the excess capacity in the countries that supply goods to America begin to weigh on the pricing of those goods. And so there’s a risk that you over-deflate because no one factors in the spillover effects of their deflation on other economies.

It’s worth saying that we are currently engaged in the most widespread increase in interest rates the world has ever seen. So we don’t actually have a lot of experience to go on. We don’t know how the world economy will react to this squeeze. But there’s reason to believe that it may be, through lack of coordination, too tight.

What’s your biggest worry about the global economic situation right now?

I think it’s not the most likely scenario, but the biggest risk is the financial system breaking down. The more likely bad outcome is a worldwide recession. Which would be a disaster. If you look at the drivers of inflation, I believe that they’re transitory. I think a lot of it will fade out in due course. I think we’re hitting the television too hard with a hammer. We don’t really understand how it works. And I have to say, as a father of a young person who’s about to graduate college, who went through the total disruption of her life through COVID, if you think about the fate of that entire cohort of young people — and we’re talking hundreds of millions of people around the world whose education was disrupted by COVID lockdowns and who are now exiting education into a labor market that might be disrupted by a post-COVID recession — I think there’s a very strong case for running the global economy hot. There’s a matter of intergenerational justice.

Now, obviously, there are cost-of-living concerns too. But for young people, the crucial thing is to get a foothold in the labor market and not to fall into an unemployment track. Because we know that a big shock to the labor market has an enduring, almost lifelong effect on people’s careers.

In China right now, they have almost 20 percent youth unemployment. I mean, that’s a staggering phenomenon for them to be dealing with. From a global point of view, we have already seen what the worst case is; it’s something like Sri Lanka. And the question really is how many more seriously weak, fragile, emerging-market, low-income countries there are. And we’re going to find out. We’re going to crash-test the entire system.

The Fed's rate hikes are a key driver of the recent volatility and darkening outlook, experts say.

Here's what six experts have said about current market risks and threats to the banking system.

Volatile assets, economic woes, and signs of distress at major banks are fueling fears of markets breaking down and roiling the global financial system.

Market strategists point to the Federal Reserve as a key driver of the current mayhem. The US central bank has raised interest rates from almost zero in March to a range of 3% to 3.25% in a bid to cool historic inflation.

However, the rate hikes have caused stocks to tumble, bond yields to climb and the US dollar to surge. The risk of a global economic slowdown has risen in turn, experts say.

Notably, Credit Suisse's stock plunged this week, and the cost of insuring against the Swiss bank defaulting on its debts soared. Those moves suggest investors are growing worried about the lender's stability as it prepares to restructure its business.

Here's what 6 experts have said about the risks in markets today:





1. Charlie McElligott, a cross-asset macro strategist at Nomura

""The velocity of things breaking around the world ... is obviously a 'neon swan' telling us that we are clearly now in the market accident stage,"" McElligott told the Financial Times. He was describing the current dangers as blatant, compared with a ""black swan"" — a rare, unpredictable, and impactful event.

The strong dollar is ""causing tremendous strains economically ... and increasingly, metastasizing in markets,"" McElligott added.

2. Michael Edwards, the deputy investment chief of Weiss Multi-Strategy Advisers

""When financial conditions tighten this much, everyone is looking for who or what will be the cause for central banks to blink,"" Edwards told the FT.

He said the Fed has to tighten funding conditions to cool the buoyant US economy, meaning ""someone will get hurt.""

3. George Goncalves, head of US macro strategy at MUFG

""This is a story about boiling lobsters,"" Goncalves told the FT. ""You put them in cold water and slowly turn the heat up.""

""That is what is happening in markets, the Fed is turning up the heat,"" he continued. ""But because the market is still flush with liquidity, it's not yet clear where the weakness is.""

4. Cathie Wood, the head of Ark Invest

""There are stresses and strains in the financial system that I believe have begun to show themselves,"" Wood told CNBC on Tuesday. ""We are experiencing a major financial shock.""

Wood pointed to the pain felt by Britain's pensions sector when UK government bond yields surged last week, and the soaring cost of insuring against America's biggest banks defaulting.

5. Sheila Bair, the former chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)

""It's concerning when a bank in market conditions like this says that they're restructuring, they're going to sell assets, they're going to raise capital,"" she said about Credit Suisse in a Fox Business interview on Thursday. ""I think this bears really careful observation.""

Bair emphasized the dangers of derivatives, underscored the interconnectedness of the banking system, and noted there's always a big loser when something breaks down.

""The complexity around these products, the fancy financial engineering, who's left holding the bag?"" she asked. ""It was AIG last time, let's hope it's not Credit Suisse this time.""

She also urged the Fed to ensure the financial system remains stable as it proceeds with further rate hikes, or it could cause a credit crunch that hammers American consumers and businesses.

6. Bruce Kasman, the head of economic research at JPMorgan Chase

The financial system isn't especially vulnerable today, as banks remain relatively healthy and most corporations have little need for financing, Kasman told the FT.

However, he noted the US Treasury's financial stress index has surged to almost a two-year high, suggesting higher rates and a stronger dollar are spreading stress across financial markets.

""Risks to global financial stability are an increasingly known unknown for the outlook,"" Kasman said."

Stocks, as measured by the Wilshire 5000 all-cap index, have shed $12trn of market capitalisation since January. Another $7trn has been wiped off bonds, which have lost 14% of their value. Some $2trn of crypto market-cap has vanished over the past year. House prices adjust more slowly, but are falling. Mortgage rates have hit 7%, up from 3% last year. And this is all in America—one of the world’s strongest economies.

Rising rates will slow the American economy and should break the back of inflation. But what else will they break? Since the Federal Reserve raised rates again on September 22nd, global markets have been in turmoil. When the British government announced unfunded tax cuts a day later, fire-sales by pension funds caused the yield on government bonds (or “gilts”) to spiral out of control. Contagion then spread to the American Treasury market, which is as volatile and illiquid as it was at the start of covid-19. The cost to insure against the default of Credit Suisse, a global bank, has risen sharply. These ructions indicate the world is entering a new phase, in which financial markets no longer just reflect the pain of adjusting to the new economic context—pricing in higher rates and lower growth—but now also spread pain of their own.

The most catastrophic pain is felt when financial institutions fail. There are two ways they do so: illiquidity or insolvency. Tighter monetary policy is likely to prompt or reveal both. It is illiquidity that comes first—and it has well and truly arrived. Take the British pension funds. They use a strategy called “liability-driven investing” to hedge against interest-rate moves. When rates shot up they faced margin calls, which they met by selling gilts. But yields moved so fast that this became a fire-sale, with prices spiralling downwards. The Bank of England had to step in to buy bonds. No one else was willing.

Story continues

Credit costs are rising quickly, as would be expected in these circumstances. Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley, a bank, highlights how abrupt the shift has been: “In the most recent senior-loan-officers survey every single question they asked bankers about financial conditions flipped to tightening, all at once. I have never seen that before.” Yet the real problem is when credit is unavailable—no matter the price. British traders report there were “no bids” for gilts in the days after the government announced its plans. Measures of liquidity in the Treasury market have deteriorated, too. “We are seeing what happened in March 2020 again. The same Treasury bonds are trading at different prices, bid-ask spreads are widening,” says Darrell Duffie of Stanford University. Strategists at Bank of America describe their index of credit stress as “borderline critical” .

Equity markets have been just as turbulent, but they have at least continued to function. “You might not have liked the price you were seeing,” says Tal Cohen of Nasdaq, a stock exchange, “but you were always seeing a price.” He has yet to witness “demand destruction”, the thinning out of the order book when buyers and sellers begin to pull their orders en masse. This is despite the fact that the Bank of America’s strategists think markets have fallen to levels at which accumulated losses may be forcing funds to sell assets to raise cash, accelerating the sell-off.

Regardless, illiquidity in credit markets is enough of a problem. It can morph into a total lack of lending. Last week British banks rushed to pull mortgages from their proverbial shelves. If this dynamic gets out of hand it can typically be solved by central banks stepping in and operating as a lender of last resort, as the Bank of England did. The risk of doing so is not trivial, however. Such an intervention employs quantitative easing, buying securities using central-bank money—the path used by central banks to ease monetary policy. Thus it might undermine faith in central bankers’ commitment to fighting inflation.

Market-watchers now wonder whether all this pressure will lead to insolvencies, which happen when the value of an institution’s assets falls below its liabilities. It is the fate which befell insurers, including AIG, and banks, including Lehman Brothers, in 2008. Homeowners across America defaulted on their loans, meaning mortgage-backed securities, assets the firms had bought, were no longer worth anything close to that for which they had been purchased. Insolvency is fatal, and only resolvable by bankruptcy or bail-outs.

No time for cramming

The current tension is the first big test of a new-look financial system. Regulators have sought to make systemically important institutions—as Lehman Brothers surely would have been designated—too safe to fail. They have done this by compelling firms designated as such to follow stringent capital, liquidity and risk-taking rules, as well as by stress-testing them in hypothetical economic breakdowns. Regulators have also tried to reduce opacity and counterparty risk—the channels through which fears about Lehman morphed into suspicion of the entire banking system.

The result is that there are layers of protection around the financial system’s most important institutions. At the heart of markets are clearing houses, which settle trades in stocks and derivatives between their members (mostly big banks). To join a clearing house a member must post an “initial margin” in case of default; that margin can climb if markets move. The system is stress-tested against the default of even the clearing houses’ largest members, such as JPMorgan Chase or Citigroup.

The banks, which stand between the clearing houses and other financial institutions, such as pension funds, hedge funds and insurance firms, are also in better shape than they were heading into the financial crisis. The issues that precipitated the failure of Lehman Brothers were that the firm did not have enough capital (at times leading up to its demise it held capital worth just 3% of assets), it had taken on too much borrowing (holding debt worth 30 times its equity), its business model was dubious (making enormous bets on the American housing market), and it had taken on vast amounts of risk.

Today there are 30 global banks designated as systemically important by regulators, some 28 of which are included in the kbw Nasdaq Global Bank Index, which tracks bank stocks. These 28 banks hold 13% of their assets as capital, and have debt worth five times their equity. But they do not get an entirely clean bill of health: some business models look fragile. On average the banks returned 9% profit on their equity last quarter, but the worst (other than Credit Suisse) returned just 4%. It is hard to assess, from the outside, whether any have taken huge risks.

“American banks are unequivocally much stronger,” says a bank boss. Few are making such statements about European banks, and certainly nobody is about Credit Suisse. The firm had a return on equity of minus 14% last quarter, its share price has tumbled and its market capitalisation is now just $12bn. Yet even Credit Suisse is not near a Lehman-style collapse. It holds 14% of its assets as capital and has debt worth only six times its equity. Although Credit Suisse credit-default swaps, which act like insurance against default, have leapt, they still suggest the chance of default is in the low to mid-single digits.

Big banks therefore head into the new era fortified. But the regulation that has strengthened their defences has also diminished their role. High capital demands make it hard for them to compete. Because banks must add risk weights to all kinds of assets, they now hold only the boring stuff. Leverage ratios constrain their size, even in the gilt markets. By contrast, financial institutions that are not systemically important are unencumbered by these rules.

The impact can be seen on balance sheets. In 2010, just after the financial crisis, banks held $115trn of financial assets. Other financial institutions, such as pension funds, insurers and alternative asset managers, held roughly the same amount. In the years since, the non-banks’ slice has grown. By the end of 2020 they held assets worth $227trn, a quarter more than the banks. Similarly, the share of American mortgages that came from banks was around 80% before the financial crisis. Today only around half of mortgages emerge from banks, and most of these are sold on to investors.

The flight of risk

Thus the dodgy stuff is probably in other institutions. Which ones? In 2007 problems started in real estate. This time Americans hold far less mortgage debt, but the sheer pace of price growth in residential housing suggests some buyers will face difficulties. Indeed, three-quarters of those who bought in the past two years regret their decision. Other forms of real estate are also vulnerable. Firms are downsizing their offices to adapt to working from home, posing problems for highly leveraged commercial developers. Charles Bendit of Taconic Partners, a developer in New York, notes that lots have opted for floating-rate debt, meaning their debt-servicing costs have already doubled.

Michael Burry, who shot to fame in 2008 after shorting mortgage-backed securities, is concerned by unsecured consumer finance given the growth of “buy-now-pay-later” providers and the ease with which consumers have been able to tap credit-card lines. Goldman Sachs, a bank, ventured into consumer credit in 2019, helping to launch the Apple card. It now has a default rate of 3% over the past six months, unusually high even for sub-prime consumer lending. Ms Graseck of Morgan Stanley points out that, because this is an interest rate-shock driven cycle, trouble will probably first arrive in the loans that reprice to higher rates quickly: “Floating rate debt, like credit cards, is immediate, then commercial real estate, autos and eventually mortgages.”

One of the fastest-growing parts of private credit has been that offered to software-service firms, notes Seth Bernstein, the boss of Alliance Bernstein, an asset manager. “These have been fantastic cash machines, because they have subscription models,” he explains. The cash flows they provide have been used to secure financing, meaning many firms are now highly leveraged. They have also never been tested in a downturn. Mr Bernstein compares the situation to the securitisation of housing debt, in that there is very little information or data available about the debt.

It is companies more broadly that appear most at risk. They owe debts worth 80% of GDP, compared with 65% in 2007. A third of American corporate debt is rated BBB, the lowest investment-grade rating. Firms downgraded any further are no longer eligible for many investors’ portfolios. And defaults are now arriving. Bausch Health, a health-care provider, gave up the ghost on September 30th, taking the default rate for high-yield issuers above 1%, its highest since June 2020. Banks are struggling to offload debt they agreed to issue for corporate takeovers.

Who holds these bad assets? Firms that have grown tremendously over the past fifteen years are the first place to look. Alternative assets, which include private equity, private debt, real estate and hedge funds, have grown from just 8% of total financial assets in 2006 to 15% now. They have taken paper losses of 11% on their investments this year, a much smaller fall than in the public markets. This might reflect sensible investment strategies—or an unwillingness to adjust to reality.

Firms that have escaped the full weight of regulation are another place to look. The Financial Stability and Oversight Council (fsoc), an outfit established by America’s Treasury to watch important financial institutions, tried to claim oversight of the big insurance companies, including MetLife, AIG and Prudential. But MetLife won a lawsuit to have the designation overturned, and the FSOC then rescinded its designations of the rest.

If lots of investors are washed out, as they would be if a non-bank financial institution failed, well, “who cares?” quips one bank boss. Given reforms since the last financial crisis, it seems unlikely that governments would be called upon to intervene with bail-outs for institutions that are too big and too important to fail. The systemic institutions will survive another event like the blow-up of the hedge funds Archegos and LCTM. But that does not make life any easier for central banks. It is their job to tighten policy enough to cool inflation without causing seriously disruptive activity in financial markets. And it is looking increasingly difficult to do both.

The OPEC-plus alliance - the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries -is a conglomerate of oil-producing countries informally led by Saudi Arabia and Russia that decides how much crude oil to sell on the global market.

From the beginning of November, they have agreed to slash the amount of oil they supply to the global economy by 2 million barrels per day.

That would send the price for a barrel of crude oil up significantly, with some economists forecasting it could cost as much as $17 more per barrel.

The consumer would likely bear the brunt of that when they fill up their cars.

Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman claimed the alliance was being proactive in adjusting supply ahead of a possible downturn in demand because of a slowing global economy.

“We are going through a period of diverse uncertainties which could come our way, it’s a brewing cloud,” he said.

But critics noted it coincides with attempts by Western allies to impose price caps amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The cuts will have a significant impact on global inflation rates.

Last month, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said inflation in the 12 months to August had risen to 6.8 per cent.

A significant driver of that was an increase in the price of petrol, up 15 per cent.

Inflation was higher in July and only came down due to a marginal decline in the cost of fuel, statistician Dr David Gruen said.

“This saw the annual movement for Automotive fuel fall from 43.3 per cent in June to 15.0 per cent in August,” he said.

But the OPEC-plus decision is likely to see that number trend back upwards.

“Higher oil prices will inevitably add to the inflation headache that global central banks are fighting, and higher oil prices will factor into the calculus of further increasing interest rates to cool down the economy,” Jorge Leon, senior vice president at Rystad Energy, wrote.

The expected hike to petrol prices comes as the fuel excise cut expires in Australia.

The former Morrison government’s six-month halving of the fuel excise tax, announced in its last federal budget in March, ended at the end of September.

Drivers can expect to pay about 25 cents per litre more for petrol - or about $15 more to fill a 60-litre tank.

But industry experts say the increases should not be felt immediately.

About 700 million litres of petrol already in tanks at stations nationwide were purchased at the discounted rate.

While those stocks won’t last forever, it should temporarily mitigate the price rise.

When the excise cut came into effect, it took about six weeks before the full savings were passed on to the consumer.

The ACCC is expecting a similar lag this time around.

“We expect that there will be no uncharacteristic or abnormal retail price increases in the days leading up to, on the day of, or after the reintroduction of the full rate of fuel excise,” it said.

“Following the excise reintroduction, the ACCC will be monitoring wholesale and retail prices closely and will not hesitate to take action where there is evidence of misleading or deceptive conduct, misrepresentation about the excise increase and retail prices, and anti-competitive behaviour.”

The Labor government has repeatedly declined to extend the excise cut due to budgetary constraints.

Treasurer Jim Chalmers said people should not see an immediate increase to the cost of petrol.

“Fuel prices in most parts of the country at the moment are now around 50c a litre below the peak recorded in July,” Chalmers said.

“Industry estimates that there (will) be more than 700 million litres of lower excise fuel in the system when the fuel excise is reintroduced.

“This is 700 million reasons why the price should not shoot up by the full 23c on the night the excise relief ends.”

The price of petrol rose significantly in the lead-up to the March budget due largely to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

7a1fc668-0ab8-4f0e-b397-f8ec9bd3bff7,"Global shares have risen as the US dollar eased ahead of US jobs data that could offer a steer on the outlook for interest rates, while oil prices surged after OPEC+ agreed to cut output.

Investors are anxiously waiting for confirmation from Friday's US non-farm payrolls report of the resilience of the world's largest economy.

Right now, a mixed picture is forming, after job openings figures suggested hiring is slowing, while measures of private-sector employment and service sector activity pointed to a stronger September than many had expected.

The dollar, which has been on a seemingly unstoppable upward path this year, retreated on Thursday, feeding some risk appetite and boosting the commodities complex, where oil was holding around its highest in three weeks.

The overarching view, however, is that Friday's jobs report will do little to weaken the Federal Reserve's determination to raising interest rates fast to tackle inflation - a view confirmed by a number of central bank officials overnight.

""The Fed officials have been giving out a clear message lately on the goal of getting inflation under control, without being concerned about the domestic economy or the turmoil in the global financial markets,"" Saxo Bank strategist Charu Chanana said.

""While the two key indicators, Friday's monthly payroll report and the monthly CPI data on October 13, could still distort the market pricing of the Fed's message, that would make the Fed's job that much harder.""

The MSCI All-World index of global shares was up 0.3 per cent on the day, heading for a week-on week gain of 5.3 per cent, its largest weekly increase since the week of March 18 this year. This is on the heels of September's 9.7 per cent decline.

Overnight, San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly underscored the US central bank's commitment to curbing inflation with more interest rate hikes, although she also said the Fed will not simply barrel ahead if the economy starts to crack.

Complicating the near-term outlook further is next week's data on US consumer inflation, which is expected to have slowed for a third month in September to 8.1 per cent, still its highest since the mid-1980s.

""We're in two environments right now and the market is trying to decide whether we are in an inflationary or recessionary one,"" Justin Onuekwusi, head of EMEA retail investments at Legal & General Investment Management, said.

""What this means in the short-term is that good news is bad news as the Fed is seen putting its foot on the brakes harder if we get good data, and if we get weaker data it's seen as a sign that Fed and other central banks will loosen (monetary policy) earlier,"" he said.

US non-farm payrolls data is due on Friday and analysts polled by Reuters expect 250,000 jobs were added last month. This would mark the smallest increase so far in 2022. The unemployment rate is expected to come in at 3.7 per cent.

The dollar eased 0.1 per cent against a basket of major currencies on Thursday, after having risen 0.7 per cent the day before, while US Treasury yields were up just 2 basis points at 3.78 per cent.

Just as investors appeared to get some respite from a relentless march higher in energy costs - not least in Europe, where consumers are facing a doubling in their utility bills compared with last year - crude oil jumped for a fourth day.

The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners, including Russia, have agreed to the deepest cut in production since the COVID-19 pandemic began, choking off supply to an already tight market.

Oil prices rose to their highest since mid-September. Brent crude futures were up 0.8 per cent at $94.07 a barrel while US futures rose 0.6 per cent to $88.31.

Oil is up about 15 per cent so far this year, but it's a far cry from the near-record of $139.13 a barrel in early March. Concern over economic slowdown has seen the price fall in four out of the last five months.

""Clearly, demand destruction could also help to partly offset these supply cuts, although how much demand destruction we see will really depend on the severity of any upcoming recession,"" ING strategist Warren Patterson said.

Meanwhile, in Europe, stocks bounced back after a dip in the previous session, with investors awaiting more economic data and minutes of the European Central Bank's September meeting for clues on the pace and path of rate hikes.

The STOXX 600 index was up 0.5 per cent, while S&P 500 futures fell 0.2 per cent. Nasdaq futures dipped 0.1 per cent, suggesting more modest losses at the opening bell later."

The White House said President Biden was disappointed by the move from the 13-member cartel, saying the decision was “short-sighted”.

""The President is disappointed by the short-sighted decision by OPEC+ to cut production quotas while the global economy is dealing with the continued negative impact of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin’s invasion of Ukraine,"" a statement said.

“At a time when maintaining a global supply of energy is of paramount importance, this decision will have the most negative impact on lower- and middle-income countries that are already reeling from elevated energy prices.”

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the move is a “clear” indicator that OPEC is siding with Russia, which would benefit from higher prices given its ongoing conflict in Ukraine.

“Look, it’s clear that OPEC+ is aligning with — with Russia with today’s announcement,” she told reporters.

“And I’ll leave it — I’ll leave it as that.”

As a result The White House has called on domestic energy companies to keep bringing pump prices down by ""closing the historically large gap between wholesale and retail gas prices”.

It said the move by OPEC is a crucial reminder for the US to lessen its reliance on foreign fossil fuels.

“In light of today’s action, the Biden Administration will also consult with Congress on additional tools and authorities to reduce OPEC’s control over energy prices,” it said.

“Finally, today’s announcement is a reminder of why it is so critical that the United States reduce its reliance on foreign sources of fossil fuels.”

Sky News Australia’s Business Editor Ross Greenwood said OPEC’s decision will result in higher petrol prices domestically.

“Within a period of time – a very short period of time – you’re going to see petrol prices rising,” he said.

“It had got down around $USD76 a barrel – so there had been a significant fall in the price of oil.

“So what OPEC has done – and Russia basically agreeing with this as well - is to actually cut the production of oil to try and push up that price.

“To earn more revenue for their nations. Russia, of course, a major oil producer needs that money to funds its war.”

Australians can already expect to fork out more at the bowser after the temporary six-month halving of the fuel excise tax ended in September."

In a meeting on Wednesday in Vienna, the OPEC+ group that comprises most of the world’s top oil exporters agreed to cut production, on paper, by 2 million barrels per day -- the biggest slash in production since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In reality, the cartel will probably shave something like 1 million barrels off the market, since most OPEC members are already underproducing. Crude prices nudged upward Wednesday but didn’t spike.

“They agreed to a larger cut on paper so they wouldn’t have to renegotiate quotas, which is always like pulling teeth,” said Matthew Reed, an expert on the oil industry and the vice president of Foreign Reports, a Washington-based consulting firm. “This is crucial.

b7618958-29d1-4d8f-816a-f1c06ec0641b,"Growth in global trade flows will be dramatically lower than expected in 2023, according to a report issued Wednesday by the World Trade Organization, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and global central banks’ efforts to fight inflation continue to take a toll.

The WTO projected that after expanding at a 3.5% pace in 2022, growth in the trade of goods in 2023 will plunge to just 1%. That’s considerably below the agency’s most recent estimate from April, which had trade expanding at a 3.4% clip next year.

WTO analysts cited various causes for the expected slowdown. Among other things, the increase in the price of energy, staple foods, fertilizer and other goods brought on by the war in Ukraine will continue reducing consumer spending on other items. Additionally, interest rate hikes in the United States and other advanced economies are expected to constrain consumers further, while China’s continuing struggle to manage COVID-19 has created ongoing production problems.

""Policymakers are confronted with unenviable choices as they try to find an optimal balance among tackling inflation, maintaining full employment and advancing important policy goals such as transitioning to clean energy,” WTO Director General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said in a statement.

‘No surprise’

Jake Colvin, president of the National Foreign Trade Council, told VOA that even without the geopolitical shock of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and problems with the global supply chain arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, there were other factors that made a slowdown in trade growth likely.

“It's no surprise that while the party was raging for the global economy in the wake of COVID lockdowns, that the inflation hangover is real,” Colvin said. “There's likely to be downward pressure on global trade for the foreseeable future, as this report points out, because of persistently high inflation, as well as ongoing supply chain challenges.”

Colvin pointed out that the recent surge in the strength of the U.S. dollar against other global currencies would also complicate trade issues.

“The world is grappling with the strength of the U.S. dollar,” he said. “Obviously, a strong U.S. dollar is good for U.S. consumers. It makes imports less expensive. But it makes U.S. exports more expensive. So, a strong U.S. dollar is always a headwind for American exporters. And it also is a challenge for countries around the world that have to buy things in dollars, including energy.”

Growth projections vary

The 2023 growth rates for North America and Asia are expected to be slightly above the global trend, at 1.4% and 1.1%. However, they will be significantly lower than in 2022. The WTO projects that North America will end this year with a 3.4% growth in trade, while Asia will experience 2.9% growth.

Regions projected to have positive but below average growth in 2023 include Europe at 0.8% and South America at 0.3%. That compares with projected full-year 2022 growth of 1.8% for Europe and 1.6% for South America.

Regions that can expect negative growth are Africa at -1.0% and the Middle East at -1.5%. However, both are expected to end 2022 with annual growth much higher than the global average, with Africa at 6.0% and the Middle East at 14.6%.

The seventh region in the assessment is the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), a free trade bloc made up primarily of former satellite states of the Soviet Union and dominated by Russia. The data indicate that the CIS will see growth of 3.3% next year. However, the report said, that apparent growth will reflect only a partial recovery from the sharp -5.8% slowdown in trade growth the bloc is projected to have suffered by the end of 2022.

China’s challenges

The decline in forecast growth for Asia is driven in large part by China, which is experiencing reversals in imports and exports. This is the result of a combination of factors, but the most notable among them is COVID-19.

“The zero-COVID policy that President Xi [Jinping] has been pursuing … really put the squeeze on the Chinese economy,” Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told VOA. “Production is not there for what could be many export orders. Sometimes the ports are just not functioning as they normally do, so that really has hit the exports.”

He continued, “At the same time, China is a big importer, from [around] the world, and especially from many developing countries, which send a combination of raw materials and intermediate products to China, which are then made into finished products. … So China's imports have been pretty slow lately, and this is hurting all its trading partners around the world.”

Spillover effects

In addition to a slowdown in orders from China, countries in the developing world are likely to see fewer orders for their goods from the U.S. and Europe than they have in the past, due in part to consumers being constrained by inflation and high interest rates.

Developing countries are facing the pernicious combination of lower revenues from exports, higher energy and fertilizer prices, and disruption in the global food supply. Added to that is the rising value of the U.S. dollar, which many developing countries need to purchase in order to transact business internationally.

A major concern, according to the WTO, is that this “could lead to food insecurity and debt distress in developing countries.”

Warning on restrictions

Okonjo-Iweala warned countries against reacting to Wednesday’s report by imposing export bans and taking other restrictive trade measures.

“While trade restrictions may be a tempting response to the supply vulnerabilities that have been exposed by the shocks of the past two years, a retrenchment of global supply chains would only deepen inflationary pressures, leading to slower economic growth and reduced living standards over time,” Okonjo-Iweala said.

“What we need is a deeper, more diversified and less concentrated base for producing goods and services,” she added. “In addition to boosting economic growth, this would contribute to supply resilience and long-term price stability by mitigating exposure to extreme weather events and other localized disruptions.”"
771d6855-f3ab-4945-bad1-1e4961af0f1c,"Pension funds managing vast sums on behalf of retired people across Britain came close to collapse amid an “unprecedented” meltdown in UK government bond markets after Kwasi Kwarteng’s mini-budget, the Bank of England has said.

Explaining its emergency intervention to calm turmoil in financial markets last week, the central bank said pension funds with more than £1tn invested in them came under severe strain with a “large number” in danger of going bust.

The Bank said a dramatic rise in interest rates on long-dated UK government bonds in the days immediately after the chancellor’s mini-budget had triggered a “self-reinforcing” spiral in debt markets, putting the stability of Britain’s financial system at risk.

03:29 From mini-budget to market turmoil: Kwasi Kwarteng's week – video timeline

Had the Bank not intervened with a promise to buy up to £65bn of government debt, funds managing money on behalf of pensioners across the country “would have been left with negative net asset value” and cash demands they could not have met.

“As a result, it was likely that these funds would have to begin the process of winding up the following morning,” the Bank said.

The central bank said the meltdown was at risk of rippling through the UK financial system, which could have then caused “excessive and sudden tightening of financing conditions for the real economy”.

Threadneedle Street stepped in last week after a collapse in the pound to the lowest level against the dollar in history and as interest rates on UK government bonds rose to the highest level since the 2008 financial crisis.

In a letter to the Commons Treasury committee explaining the intervention, the Bank’s deputy governor for financial stability, Jon Cunliffe, suggested the largest market movements came after the chancellor’s mini-budget.

On the day the Bank raised interest rates on Thursday 22 September, he said the currency had been “broadly stable” and long-term interest rates – or yields – on government bonds rose by about 20 basis points. Only on the following day, when Kwarteng unveiled £45bn of unfunded tax cuts, did the Bank’s market intelligence identify the first concerns from pension fund managers.

Cunliffe said sterling collapsed by about 4% against the dollar and 2% against the euro, while long-term bond yields rose 30 basis points amid “very poor” conditions for the number of buyers and sellers prepared to trade on that day.

Ministers had attempted to argue that the market turmoil reflected global factors. However, the Bank appeared to undermine this suggestion, publishing a chart highlighting a sharp rise in 30-year borrowing costs after the mini-budget that was not replicated in the US or the EU.

Sources in the City warned of a “doom loop” emerging last week for pensions funds invested in liability driven investment (LDI). The funds had invested in complex derivatives, using long-dated government bonds as collateral – assets pledged as security to back up a financial contract.

Quick Guide Glossary of key terms to explain UK economic turmoil Show Monetary policy The job of the Bank of England, which since 1997 has had the statutory task of hitting the inflation target set by the government – currently 2%. Fiscal policy The Treasury is responsible for fiscal policy, which involves taxation, public spending and the relationship between the two. 'Fiscal easing' is when plans for tax cuts not are not matched by planned spending cuts. Budget deficit The gap between what the government spends and its tax revenues Government debt The sum of annual budget deficits – and the less frequent surpluses – over time. Government bonds In the UK these are known as gilts, and are a way the state borrows to finance its spending. The fact that governments guarantee to pay investors back means they are traditionally seen as low risk. Bonds mature over different timescales, including one year, five years, 10 years and 30 years. Bond yields and prices Most bonds are issued at a fixed interest rate and the yield is the return on the capital invested. When the Bank of England cuts interest rates, the fixed return on gilts becomes more attractive and prices rise. However, when interest rates rise gilts become less attractive and prices fall. Therefore when bond prices fall, bond yields rise, and vice versa. Short- and long-term interest rates Short-term interest rates are set by the Bank of England’s MPC, which meets eight times a year. Long-term interest rates move up and down with fluctuations in gilt yields, with the most important the yield on 10-year gilts. Long-term interest rates affect the cost of fixed-rate mortgages, overdrafts and credit card borrowing. Quantitative easing and quantitative tightening When the Bank of England buys bonds it is called quantitative easing (QE), because the Bank pays for the bonds it is purchasing by creating electronic money, which it hopes will find its way into the financial system and the wider economy. Quantitative tightening (QT) has the opposite effect. It reduces the money supply through sales of assets. Pension funds and the bond markets Pension funds tend to be big holders of bonds because they provide a relatively risk-free way of guaranteeing payouts to retirees over many decades. Movements in bond prices tend to be relatively gradual, but pension funds still take out insurance – hedging policies – as protection to limit their exposure. A rapid drop in gilt prices can threaten to make these hedges ineffective. Margin calls Buying on margin is where an investor or institution buys an asset through a downpayment and borrows money to cover the rest of the cost. The upside of margin trading is that it allows big bets and higher returns when times are good. But investors have to provide collateral to cover losses when times are bad. In times of stress they are subject to margin calls, where they have to find additional collateral, often very quickly. Doom loop This is where a financial crisis starts to feed on itself, because institutions are forced into a fire sale of their assets to meet margin calls. If pension funds are selling gilts into a falling market, the result is lower gilt prices, higher gilt yields, bigger losses and further margin calls. Fiscal dominance This is where the Bank of England is prevented from taking the action it thinks is necessary to combat inflation because of the size of the budget deficit being run by the Treasury. Fiscal dominance could take two forms: the Bank might keep interest rates lower than they would otherwise be, in order to reduce the government’s interest payments on its borrowing, or it might involve covering government borrowing by buying more gilts.

In the market turmoil after the mini-budget, the value of UK government bonds fell sharply as investors began to lose faith in the credibility of the Truss administration to run a sustainable tax and spending policy. This meant a rise in yields – which move inversely to bond prices – in a reflection of the increased cost of government borrowing.

As a result pensions funds invested in LDI schemes faced rolling “margin calls” as the value of the bonds they had pledged as collateral collapsed. The funds then moved to sell other long-dated bonds they held to cover the cash demands, which in turn led to further selling pressure in the bond market in a self-reinforcing downward spiral.

Cunliffe said the Bank picked up intelligence that funds were preparing to sell at least £50bn of long-dated government bonds in a short space of time, more than four times the usual £12bn seen in average market trading volumes in recent weeks.

In the period immediately before the Bank intervened, yields on 30-year UK government bonds rose by 35 basis points on two separate days. The biggest daily rise before last week, on data going back to the turn of the century, was 29 basis points.

Measured over a four-day period, the increase was more than twice as large as the biggest move since 2000, which occurred during a “dash for cash” at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic when global financial markets plunged into one of the worst meltdowns since the Wall Street crash on 1929.

On Thursday night, a Treasury spokesperson maintained that the turmoil was a worldwide issue, saying: “While the UK has seen disruption, global financial markets have also seen significant volatility in recent weeks.”

They added: “The UK economy is in a competitive position, with unemployment close to its lowest level in almost 50 years and the second lowest net debt to GDP ratio in the G7. Our growth plan will unleash growth and make the UK more competitive.

“The government is committed to strong fiscal discipline and to debt falling as a percentage of GDP over the medium term. Further details will be set out in a medium term fiscal plan shortly, alongside a forecast by the independent OBR.”

The Bank of England (BoE) has said that its £65bn ($73) invention last week saved Britain from being on the brink of a financial crisis.

A letter from Sir Jon Cunliffe, deputy governor of the BoE, highlighted that there was fear of “severe disruption of core funding markets and consequent widespread financial instability”

He added that pension funds would have been forced to dump £50bn worth in government bonds into a chaotic market.

“The Bank received market intelligence of increasing severity from a range of market participants, and in particular from LDI fund managers, reporting that conditions in core markets, should they continue to worsen, would force them to sell large quantities of long-term gilts in an increasingly illiquid market.

“Taken at face value, this market intelligence would have implied additional long-term gilt sales of at least £50 billion in a short space of time, as compared to recent average market trading volumes of just £12bn per day in these maturity sectors.”

LDI, or liability-driven investment, is a popular product sold by asset managers to pension funds, using derivatives to help them ""match"" assets and liabilities so there is no risk of shortfall in money to pay pensioners.

LDI was worth about £400bn in 2011, quadrupling to £1.6tn by 2021, according to the Investment Association.

Cunliffe added: “With the gilt market unable to absorb further large sales, had large sales been attempted yields would have been pushed even higher, forcing further gilt sales in an attempt to maintain solvency. This would have led to a self-reinforcing spiral of price falls and further pressure to sell gilts.

“Had the Bank not intervened on Wednesday 28 September, a large number of pooled LDI funds would have been left with negative net asset value and would have faced shortfalls in the collateral posted to banking counterparties.""

It comes in response to a series of questions from the Treasury committee chair, Mel Stride after Threadneedle Street announced a programme of temporary purchases of long-dated UK government bonds on 28 September.

The BoE said it would buy up to £65bn in gilts over a 13-day period in response to chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng’s mini-budget. The finance minister announced £45bn in unfunded tax cuts which caused volatile trading for both the pound and stock markets.

Watch: Sturgeon: UK government needs to ‘rethink’ whole mini-budget

This was the first gilt purchase announcement that the Bank has justified on financial stability grounds. Long-term borrowing costs, which had surged to their highest level in two decades, plunged after the BoE revealed its intervention.

The Treasury had since asked for an outline of the events leading up to the intervention, why the move was judged necessary, whether there will be any implications on monetary policy, and how the Bank will determine whether the intervention has been successful – and is no longer required.

The UK central bank agreed on Thursday to buy almost £154m of long-dated gilts. It also rejected £126.9m of gilts which it was offered, concluding that it did not need to stump up any more to preserve financial stability.

The Bank could spend as much as £5bn per day on long-dated gilts, but has currently only bought around £4bn in total.

The tensions with Bank Governor Andrew Bailey have mounted after Liz Truss’s conference speech last week, in which she promised to strip away EU red tape by the end of 2023. Sources say this is a year sooner than most people at the Bank were expecting.

The insiders say the Bank’s hierarchy was ‘blindsided’ by the promise, throwing it into fresh turmoil after its panic purchase of gilts to shore up the markets after Mr Kwarteng’s ‘Kamikwasi’ Budget statement.

Mr Bailey and his team had to work through the night to launch an emergency £65 billion package to stem a crisis in the market for government debt – or gilts.

Relations between the Government and the Bank of England are at ‘an historic low’ in the wake of Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng’s mini-Budget, Whitehall insiders have said

The Bank has until Friday to decide whether to extend the measures amid concerns any misstep could result in another shock to nervous financial markets.

While Ms Truss and Mr Kwarteng have explicitly drawn up an ambitious package for growth, the bank’s anti-inflation measures are likely to slow the economy down.

It is expected to deliver another sharp interest rate rise next month, with a further possible hike in December, which would reduce the amount households have to spend as bills soar.

While Ms Truss and Mr Kwarteng have explicitly drawn up an ambitious package for growth, the bank’s anti-inflation measures are likely to slow the economy down

That could hinder Government plans to deliver growth of 2.5 per cent in the ‘medium term’, unveiled in the Chancellor’s speech last month. A Whitehall source said: ‘It has been noticed that Truss keeps referencing the Bank’s independence and responsibility for interest rates, which looks like an attempt to shift the blame for rising interest rates away from her own Chancellor.

‘They have already had to find a £65 billion facility to rescue her Budget.

‘Now she has said this about EU red tape, presumably so she can blame the Bank when it inevitably misses the deadline.’

Mr Bailey has also irritated members of Ms Truss’s administration by adopting ‘woke’ policies, including a rebrand that saw the flag of St George removed from the Bank’s logo at a cost of more than £51,000."
f3ebabc7-b575-4681-a66d-02b05729f745,"The Bank of England has patched up the UK’s government bond market after the chancellor’s latest fiscal plan sent gilts plunging out of control, but whatever happens after that support runs out, some big investors say they are reluctant to buy the country’s debt again.

In a highly unusual measure to safeguard financial stability, the BoE is offering to buy a maximum of £5bn of government bonds a day until October 14 to contain a sell-off sparked by Kwasi Kwarteng’s “mini” Budget on September 23. Within days, the sell-off had became increasingly violent as it kicked off a liquidity crisis at thousands of pension funds and rattled around other parts of the financial markets.

Investors agree that this support will almost certainly keep a lid on any further volatility for now. But the episode has dulled longer-term attraction of UK government debt right at the point at which the government needs investors to step up and fund its fiscal plans. The UK Debt Management Office plans to sell £134bn of gilts by the end of March, an increase of more than £60bn from before Kwarteng’s announcement.

“We’re going to be much more reluctant to put on big trades in gilts any more,” said Christian Kopf, head of fixed income at Union Investment, a €416bn fund manager. “It has become an unpredictable market with populist policies. Even if the Bank of England has [fixed the plumbing] you are still left with an inconsistent fiscal policy.” The UK will need to offer up investors higher returns to sell its debt, raising the cost of borrowing for the government, he said.

The immediate risk for the market is a cliff edge when the BoE’s emergency intervention ends later this month. Unless the government has soothed market nerves by then, or the BoE extends the programme, that is likely to spark a renewed slump in gilts, investors say.

Kwarteng’s plan to outline a medium-term fiscal plan on November 23 could come too late to prevent further chaos.

“Liz Truss is out there trying to defend an unfunded budget,” said Luke Hickmore, a fund manager at Abrdn. “Fine, but we need to see an [Office for Budget Responsibility] report and we need to see it ideally before the end of the Bank’s current QE programme in two weeks’ time, not at the end of November.”

Prime minister Liz Truss and chancellor Kwarteng on Friday met the OBR, the UK’s official forecaster, in a bid to convince markets they are serious about bringing the country’s debt under control.

Another dent to the market could come in the form of a downgrade of the UK’s credit rating. Moody’s has already warned this week that large unfunded tax cuts threaten the government’s creditworthiness.

“The question is not will there be a downgrade, it is how many notches,” said the European head of a large global bank. The UK’s credit rating currently stands at Aa3 with Moody’s and AA with rival S&P. The banker said that a fall into single-A territory could cause some foreign investors — who own roughly 30 per cent of the gilt market — to sell their gilts.

“I think a downgrade looks completely inevitable at this point, although it sometimes takes a while for the rating agencies to act,” said Mike Riddell, a portfolio manager at Allianz Global Investors.

The country issues debt in its own currency, meaning a default is extremely unlikely, but the broader point is around the credibility of UK policymaking.

“The UK has devalued its credibility,” said Quentin Fitzsimmons, a senior portfolio manager at US asset manager T Rowe Price. “I have been in the market a long time and the most important thing is transparency and institutional credibility.” Fitzsimmons said he has been running an underweight, or negative position on UK debt since the summer, but the lack of an audit by the OBR ahead of the “mini” Budget was a red flag. “An audit is what I expect as an investor,” he said.

Some investors are also concerned about apparent inconsistencies in policy. The BoE’s new bond-buying scheme specifically targets the strains that were testing pension funds, but it also resembles the so-called quantitative easing programmes it ran after the financial crisis to stimulate the economy, which it had only recently announced it would reverse. At the same time, it is already raising interest rates to douse inflation and has said the government’s new fiscal plan will demand aggressive further tightening.

“They have to do something to give the feeling that the two authorities are not acting counter to each other,” said Niall O’Sullivan, the chief investment officer of multi-asset strategies at Neuberger Berman."

Technical Take

BTC trades flat while 'whales' remove bitcoin from exchanges en masse

The Sept. 29 Market Wrap discussed a potential uptrend because bitcoin had been reaching a series of “higher lows,” implying that buyers are willing to acquire BTC at higher prices.

Subsequent lows retraced on both Oct. 1 and Oct. 2, although this moderation occurred on the weekend when trading volume is lighter than during the week.

Monday’s volume was 40% of the 20-day average, where Saturday and Sunday trading volume was 14% and 21% of the trading volume average. The extent to which volume exceeds or falls short of its average often signals the degree of conviction behind a move.

Investors may not have to abandon hope for a resumption of an uptrend, although price action seems to favor sideways trading.

A look at BTC’s hourly chart on Monday shows the price pushing past the upper range of its Bollinger Band. Bollinger Bands are a technical indicator that plots an asset’s average price and subsequently calculates two standard deviations above and below that average.

Statistically, an asset’s price stays within two standard deviations of its average 95% of the time, making the breach of an upper or lower bound meaningful to watch.

While prices on the hourly chart have breached the top end of the Bollinger Bands, BTC’s daily chart shows its price is situated within a close range of the median price. Today’s activity may be merely pushing BTC back to a recognized average and is not providing a catalyst to push it significantly past its current level.

Derivative and on-chain activity implies an underlying support that could prevent prices from falling significantly. Funding rates for BTC have been positive for seven consecutive days, and for 16 of the last 20.

Funding rates can serve as a measure of sentiment, as investors who wish to be long BTC pay investors who wish to be short. In conjunction with this is a sharp decline in “whale” net volume to exchanges.

The graph below shows that “whales” (entities holding at least 1,000 BTC), have moved BTC off exchanges to the largest extent in four years.

BTC movement off exchanges is often viewed as bullish, or at least supportive, because it suggests investors are moving assets into cold storage and not designating them for trading.

Centralized exchanges have also seen significant BTC outflows.

NEW YORK, Oct 7 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar strengthened against major currencies on Friday after U.S. data showing employers hired more workers than expected in September, suggesting the Federal Reserve will likely stick to its aggressive tightening policy for now.

The dollar reversed early losses against the Japanese yen and was last up 0.2% at 145.42 yen. The dollar hit a 24-year peak of 145.90 yen last month, which had prompted an intervention by Japanese authorities to shore up the fragile yen.

The euro fell against the dollar, extending losses after the U.S. jobs report, and was last down 0.6% at $0.9735.

""Any sign of U.S. economic weakness will weigh heavily on the dollar, but it certainly didn't come with nonfarm payrolls,"" said Adam Button, chief currency analyst at ForexLive in Toronto.

Nonfarm payrolls increased by 263,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said in its closely watched employment report. Data for August was unrevised to show 315,000 jobs added as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 250,000 job gains, with estimates ranging from as low as 127,000 to as high as 375,000.

Overnight, a number of Fed officials reinforced the view that the central bank is nowhere near finished with raising rates as it seeks to tame inflation, and interest rates are expected to go up further. read more

U.S. inflation data, due next week, will be watched closely as well and could prove influential in setting investors' expectations for the Fed, according to strategists.

The U.S. central bank, in an effort to tame inflation, has hiked its policy rate from near-zero at the beginning of this year to the current range of 3.00% to 3.25%, and last month signaled more large increases were on the way this year.

A U.S. dollar index which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies was last up 0.6% and hit its highest in a week. The index is up about 18% for the year so far.

Sterling was down 0.9% at $1.1060, having fallen 1.4% overnight. It jumped earlier this week, after the British government reversed a planned cut to the highest rate of income tax.

The dollar also gained against China's offshore yuan Friday, and was last up 0.7% at 7.1313.

NEW YORK, Oct 6 (Reuters) - The dollar rose on Thursday, climbing for a second straight session, as investors bet on another strong U.S. non-farm payrolls report that should keep the Federal Reserve on an aggressive tightening path for some time.

The dollar index , which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, surged more than 1% to 112.22 and was up about 17% for the year so far.

The euro was down 0.9% against the dollar at $0.9794, earlier falling after the release of European Central Bank minutes from last month's meeting that showed policymakers were worried that inflation could get stuck at exceptionally high levels.

Separately, a source told Reuters on Thursday, citing provisional figures, that the German government expects Europe's largest economy to slide into recession next year, contracting 0.4% as an energy crisis, rising prices and supply bottlenecks take their toll.

Sterling was down 1.5% versus the dollar at $1.1151. The euro also firmed against the pound, up 0.7% at 87.83 pence.

Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.3% to 145.05. It hit a session high of 145.135, not far from a 24-year peak of 145.90 yen touched on Sept. 22, which triggered a yen-buying intervention from Japanese authorities.

Against the Swiss franc, the dollar rose 0.8% to 0.9906 francs .

Currency markets have struggled to find a clear direction this week, following a dramatic third quarter. The dollar initially slid against most majors, before regaining ground.

""It's the calm before the storm - the non-farm payrolls storm,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York.

""Everyone knows the Fed has been consistent with their messaging. The Fed is not done bringing down inflation, and they are locked into this aggressive rate-hiking campaign that will only change once we start to see inflation come down.""

A major factor driving currency markets currently has been changing expectations of how aggressively central banks' - particularly the Fed - will raise interest rates.

A key question is whether policymakers will pivot from primarily worrying about inflation to also considering slowing economic growth, and possibly leading to more cautious interest rate hikes.

U.S. inflation data next week will be closely watched.

A closely watched U.S. dollar index fell sharply Tuesday, accelerating a retreat from a 20-year high and giving stocks and commodities room to bounce. But the tune in the FX market, as well as other assets, remains largely a function of the bond market, reminded Kit Juckes, global macro strategist at Société Générale, in a Tuesday note (see chart below).

Treasury yields, which had accelerated a surge higher in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s Sept. 20-21 meeting, were in retreat as investors weighed the prospect of a so-called pivot by policy makers away from its path of rapid and aggressive rate increases.

“This is not the first time a pattern of rising U.S. bond yields and falling equity indices was interrupted by a correction in the former. U.S. 10-year Treasury note yields had sizable corrections in May and again in June/July, both of which triggered bear market rallies in the equity market,” Juckes wrote.

The following August-September rise in the 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 3.641% , which went from 2.6% to almost 4%, gave the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.38% an almost 10% lift and took the S&P 500 down by more than 10%, with major indexes ending last month at their lowest levels since 2020, he noted.

The Treasury selloff is taking a breather, with yields retreating sharply across the curve. The 10-year yield, which briefly ticked above 4% late last week, was trading near 3.623%. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the currency against a basket of six major rivals, dropped 1.3% on Tuesday, leaving it down 1.6% over the last two days after hitting a more-than-20-year high last week. The pullback has seen the index erase the sharp gain it posted in the wake of the Fed’s Sept. 21 rate hike.

Stocks were bouncing sharply to begin October and the fourth quarter, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +2.18% , S&P 500 SPX, +3.09% and the Nasdaq Composite COMP, +4.41% each up more than 5% over the last two sessions.

See: ‘This is not healthy’: The latest advance for stocks could signal more pain ahead for markets. Here’s why.

A strong dollar was seen as a headwind for stocks, particularly large-cap multinationals who rely more on overseas sales. The dollar’s strength was also blamed for helping send crude futures to eight-month lows in September and sinking gold. A stronger dollar is seen as a weight on commodities priced in the unit, making them more expensive to users of other currencies.

The U.S. crude benchmark CL.1, +0.21% has jumped more than 8% this week on expectations OPEC+ will deliver a large production cut and as the dollar has pulled back. Gold futures GC00, +1.81% have bounced 3.7%.

The dollar, of course, was seen as heavily stretched versus major rivals. The British pound GBPUSD, +0.50% plunged to an all-time low versus the U.S. dollar late last month as the U.K. government’s budget plans sparked a fiscal crisis that forced the Bank of England to begin buying U.K. government bonds to stave off a collapse of pension funds.

The euro EURUSD, +0.27% has bounced 1.8% versus the dollar this week but remains down more than 12% so far this year and continues to trade below parity with the U.S. dollar. The Japanese yen USDJPY, -1.21% last month traded at its weakest to the dollar since 1998, eventually prompting a rare bout of currency market intervention by Japanese authorities.

The dollar’s retracement is due to factors that are likely to fade, said Bipan Rai, head of FX strategy at CIBC Capital Markets.

“First is profit taking in tactical longs that have been built over the past few weeks. Second is the ‘peak rates’ narrative which has been given some life due to the softer ISM, [job openings data] and shift lower of late in breakevens/inflation swaps,” Rai told MarketWatch, in an email.

Indeed, analysts have cited expectations the Fed may be getting closer to the end of its rate-hike cycle as signs of cracks emerge in global financial markets and U.S. data begins to soften as a factor behind the rally in stocks and bonds (bond yields move opposite to price).

Rai was skeptical the dollar’s retreat would hold.

“We suspect the market will go back to fading this – as the data points that do matter (employment + core CPI) still indicate that the Fed has work to do. The uncertainty with where the resting spot for terminal is for the Fed will keep the USD supported on dips,” Rai said. The terminal rate refers to where the fed funds rate will peak.

Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of Australia on Tuesday stoked “pivot” expectations as it delivered a smaller-than-expected rate increase and said future moves would depend on data.

“Is the Fed going to follow the RBA and pivot to a slower pace of policy tightening, shifting the dollar smile down in the process and triggering a deeper wave of short covering for other currencies?” Juckes asked. The “dollar smile” refers to the tendency of the U.S. currency to rally when the U.S. economy significantly outperforms or underperforms its peers.

Read: What does a pivot look like? Here’s how Australia’s central bank framed a dovish surprise.

Stocks extended gains Tuesday, while Treasury yields and the dollar retreated further after a soft job openings and labor turnover survey, or JOLTS, reading pointed to a modest loosening of a tight labor market. Juckes, writing ahead of the JOLTS report, said this week’s data, including Friday’s September jobs report, will likely set the tone for coming weeks. But he was skeptical Treasury prices have much room to continue their bounce (yields move opposite to price).

“My bias is to think that this bond market rally has gone about as far as it can, and when yields turn higher again, equities will struggle, and the dollar will get its mojo back,” Juckes said. “At which point, the FX market, having exhausted itself trading sterling in recent weeks, may revert to selling the euro.”

The dollar rose on Thursday, extending its gains from the previous day as investors looked ahead to Friday's key U.S. payrolls report for signs of softness that could signal slowing U.S. rate hikes and possibly a weakening in the greenback after this year's sharp rally.

The euro was down 0.9% to $0.9793, falling a little after the release of European Central Bank minutes from last month's meeting that showed policymakers were worried that inflation could get stuck at exceptionally high levels.

Separately, a source told Reuters on Thursday, citing provisional figures, that the German government expects Europe's largest economy to slide into recession next year, contracting 0.4% as an energy crisis, rising prices and supply bottlenecks take their toll.

""It's the calm before the storm - the non-farm payrolls storm,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York.

""Everyone knows the Fed has been consistent with their messaging. The Fed is not done bringing down inflation, and they are locked into this aggressive rate-hiking campaign that will only change once we start to see inflation come down. That will obviously come along with a deterioration in the labor market and all of these key economic readings we follow.""

A major factor driving currency markets currently has been changing expectations of how aggressively central banks' - particularly the Federal Reserve - will raise interest rates.

A key question is whether policymakers will pivot from primarily worrying about inflation to also considering slowing economic growth, and possibly leading to more cautious interest rate hikes.

LONDON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - The dollar eased on Friday, ahead of a key employment report later that could offer a litmus test of the strength of the U.S. economic recovery, but with the Federal Reserve's commitment to fighting inflation, losses could be short-lived.

The euro and the pound pared overnight losses and rose for the first time in three trading sessions, while the Japanese yen clawed back from another break through the key 145 level against the dollar.

Overnight, a slew of Fed officials reinforced the view that the central bank is nowhere near finished with its hiking cycle as it seeks to bring down inflation, and that rates are expected to go up further.

The September non-farm payrolls report comes hot on the heels of a measure of private-sector hiring that beat expectations and an indicator of vacancies that showed an unexpected decline, offering a mixed picture of the jobs market.

Consumer inflation data is due next week and could prove equally influential in setting investors' expectations for the Fed, according to CIBC head of G10 currency strategy Jeremy Stretch.

""We're going into a 'double-header' next week,"" he said.

""Until we see what is effectively almost empirical evidence that either the labour market is materially easing or inflationary pressures are dissipating, dollar dips are going to remain bought into,"" he said.

The euro was last up 0.2% on the day at $0.9871, having tried twice unsuccessfully to regain parity this week.

Sterling rose 0.4% to $1.1202, having fallen 1.4% overnight. It rebounded to a high of $1.1493 earlier in the week, after the British government reversed a planned cut to the highest rate of income tax.

The U.S. dollar index eased 0.2% to 111.97, after rising nearly 1% overnight, but was still set for a decline of 0.16% this week.

All eyes now turn to the U.S. nonfarm payrolls report due later on Friday. Economists expect 250,000 jobs to have been added last month, compared with 315,000 in August.

The yen last bought 144.81 per dollar, close to a 24-year low of 145.90 hit last month that prompted an intervention by Japanese authorities to shore up the fragile currency.

""We've been long arguing that an intervention is not an effective way of changing the trend in the currency ... our sense is that the trigger for a new intervention will be a sudden drastic weakening of the yen,"" said Rodrigo Catril, a currency strategist at National Australia Bank.

In another sign that major central banks' fight against inflation is far from over, accounts from the European Central Bank's September meeting show policymakers appeared increasingly worried that high inflation could become entrenched, making aggressive policy tightening necessary even at the cost of weaker growth.

The ongoing hawkish interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and inflationary pressures from high oil prices and the Russian invasion of Ukraine have decimated the stock market and led to a bearish rally that has resulted in major stock indexes bleeding one third of their value year to date just as they had started to recover from the coronavirus pandemic.

Such an environment merits a cautious investment approach and careful stock picking, as it requires the investor to sift out companies with stable cash flows or products that are expected to withstand recessionary pressures. The latter is especially important since interest rate hikes will lead to a recession - and analysts right now only differ about its timing.

Ken Fisher, the founder of the renowned hedge fund Fisher Investments, shared his thoughts and commented that even though the market is wary of consistent interest hikes, it increases the motivation for banks to lend. Mr. Fisher outlined that:

So let me just say that when I was very young before I was an adult, Milton Friedman was saying that the central banks fiddling with interest rates thinking they can predict what that will do to the economy is beyond ridiculous and mostly, it doesn't allow you to impact the economy very directly. When I was young, the deposit base the banks lend off of was overwhelmingly, time deposits cost them money, and the spread between what they took money in at and what they lend it out at was a form of a gross margin, and the bigger that spread, the eager they became to lend the more that it was small i.e. the flattened or inverted yield curve, the less they were. But today 93% of U.S. bank lending base is interest free, free money, so the more the Federal Reserve raises rates, the more it increases the incentive of banks to lend. Which is, again, something I don't see why they don't understand that. But if you look at this period, the more inflation's gone up, the more corporate margins have gone up. Analogous not understood. Share buybacks remain strong, corporate bond spread. . . uh commercial lending through September's up 11% year over year.

We studied countless different firms out there to gauge their business models and markets, following which we sifted companies that are not significantly reliant on high incomes or purchasing power for their revenues. We preferred strong defensive plays that also pay dividends and can easily survive through the current economic turmoil. The firms were then analyzed through their recent financial performance and listed through Insider Monkey's Q2 2022 survey of 895 hedge funds.

Oct 5 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets from Jamie McGeever

Genuine turning point, or classic bear market rally?

World markets continue to rip higher as the dollar, bond yields and Fed interest rate expectations decline, confounding even the biggest optimists who had called for a positive start to the fourth quarter.

The strength of the turnaround suggests the turmoil in recent weeks might have been related in part to quarter-end factors. Equally, the strength of the current whoosh might simply be a bout of short covering to claw back some of this year's losses.

According to Goldman Sachs, the median S&P 500 peak-to-trough decline in past bear markets has been 34%. That would coincide with the 3400 area from its January peak of around 4800. Friday's low was just below 3600, down 25% from the high.

By this measure, Wall Street has further to fall before putting in the definitive bottom. It's worth bearing in mind that bear market rallies tend to be pretty rapid, ending almost as quickly as they started.

chart

Tuesday's ""risk-on"" rally was widespread. The S&P 500 recorded its strongest two-day rise - more than 5% - since March 2020, and emerging market bonds had their best day since March this year.

U.S. job openings data fueled hopes that the Fed will soon take its foot off the tightening pedal, Australia's central bank only raised rates by 25 basis points and the dollar slumped more than 1% to post its longest losing streak - five days - in over a year.

It may turn out to be a bear market rally, but for now, investors are enjoying the ride.

The stock market has gone through some dramatic volatility in recent weeks, huge declines followed by market rebounds. Swings of 500 points have become an everyday occurrence. And even a drop of 1,300 points in one day has not led to panic.

The panic will arrive in coming days when third quarter statements arrive from your brokerage accounts, IRAs and 401(k) plan. There the carnage will be revealed on the bottom line.

We are in a bear market. Pundits will debate whether this is the “best time to buy stocks in a generation” or whether the Fed’s actions will cause a huge recession, falling earnings and much lower stock prices. Watching them on TV is like watching a tennis game from mid-court — with your head moving quickly from one direction to another.

So, instead of being ruled by emotion, let’s just consider the odds of your next decision — buy or sell — being the correct one.

A double bet

It takes discipline to ride out a bear market. Every new market low reminds you that you “should have” sold earlier. If you don’t have discipline, you will sell at your moment of greatest panic. Typically, that happens very near the lows — when the vast majority of investors decide to throw in the towel. In fact, that’s what makes bear market bottoms!

Sellers tell themselves that it’s time to sell before they “lose everything.” In point of fact, no one who rode out a bear market has ever lost “everything.” Very few companies don’t survive. If you’re appropriately diversified in a mutual fund, you will never lose “everything” — except your temper!

The second rationalization is that you will “sell now, and buy back at the bottom.” But they never ring a bell at the bottom. So you wait to see if this is “just a bounce” — and you miss the greatest returns of a bull market. The best gains in a bull market are made in the first few months of the rebound.

For example, after the dot-com bust, the S&P 500 bottomed at 777 on Oct. 9, 2002 — at the end of a 2.5-year bear market. After touching a bottom seen only in hindsight, the stock index then gained 15% over the following month and a total of 34% over the following year.

To make money selling into a bear market, you have to be right two times — when to sell and, even more tricky, when to buy again. Can you do that?

Riding it out

That brings us to the strategy of “riding it out.” It’s almost as tough as selling high and buying low. Bear markets seem to last forever. But in reality, according to the market historians at Investech.com, the 10 bear markets since 1956 averaged a 33.5% decline, and lasted an average of 14 months.

However, real life is never average. The bear market of 2007 saw a 57% drop in the S&P 500 index from top to ultimate bottom. As scary as that sounds, a significant number of major American companies are today already down that far from their all-time highs.

The original FAANG stocks have been decimated. Meta (Facebook) is down nearly 60%. Amazon fell from over $177 to below $113. Netflix, which traded over $700 earlier this year, has been down to $163, before bouncing back to over $225. And Google (now Alphabet) has fallen from over $150 to a low of $96.

The S&P 500 is down about 24% as of this writing, and the NASDAQ is down more than 33%. But many of the big names have fallen more than 70%. That’s what a bear market feels like — pain in the portfolio.

When will it end?

Market historian Jim Stack of Investech, who had his subscribers well-prepared for this event with only 40% invested in equities, told me that we could currently be only one-third of the way into the bear market, and that the decline could still have a way to go. He’s concerned about the impact on the housing market as mortgage rates continue to rise.

This bear market shouldn’t trouble younger investors, who regularly contribute to their 401(k) plans, buying at bargain prices. But those closer to retirement may still need to sell some of their holdings on any bounce. Hold the rest. You’ll never be 100% right. But you will be able to sleep at night. And that’s The Savage Truth."
2aa889be-727a-432c-bdf6-278f38ec0987,"There's good reason to think the two-day surge in stocks this week wasn't another bear market rally, according to Fundstrat's Tom Lee.

The firm highlighted a ""100% bid"" day in the Nasdaq, a 10% decline in JOLTS, and stability in high-yield spreads.

""The promising aspect is the job openings are falling but the unemployment is not rising,"" Lee said.

The stock market's back-to-back rally on Monday and Tuesday could be the start of a broader uptrend rather than a dead-cat bounce, according to Fundstrat's Tom Lee.

All major stock market averages added more than 5% in gains during the two-day surge, which was initially sparked by the UK government partially reversing tax cut plans that jolted its bond market last month.

Stocks pulled back on Wednesday. But according to Lee, there are many reasons to think that the stock market rally could be sustainable heading into year-end.

For starters, the most recent JOLTS data, which measures job openings in the US economy, showed its largest decline ever ex-pandemic, with a decline of 1.1 million, or about 10%.

That's good news for the Federal Reserve, as Chair Jerome Powell seeks to put a dent in the strong labor market to tame inflation.

""The promising aspect is the job openings are falling but the unemployment is not rising,"" Lee said, which is consistent with what a soft economic landing could look like.

Other strong signs suggesting the stock market rally could become more sustainable include: a 5% decline in the US dollar index, a near 50-basis-point decline in the expected May 2023 fed funds rate, and stability in high-yield spreads despite falling stock prices.

""US high-yield spreads did not make a new 'wide' last week, while equities closed at a new low. Historically, this divergence bears watching as this similar pattern emerged in comparing October 2008 vs March 2009,"" Lee explained.

Finally, breadth, or participation in the stock market, was incredibly strong on Tuesday. The Nasdaq 100 registered a ""100% bid"" day, meaning that every stock in the index was positive in Tuesday's trading session.

""Since 1996, this has only happened six times, and six of the six times the Nasdaq 100 is higher six months and twelve months later with average gains of 27% and 34%,"" Lee said. Additionally, a 100% bid day for the Nasdaq 100 has never happened during a bear market rally. ""In isolation, this is very bullish,"" Lee said."

3534a5d1-b401-48a3-a14e-431525f58b6f,"After a brief summer rally, US financial markets have resumed the painful retreat that began soon after New Year’s celebrations ended.

So here we are again.

Just about the only thing that’s up is inflation. And that’s why we are in this mess.

We’ve seen this bad news bear-market movie before — during the pandemic in 2020, the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dot-com bust in 2000-2002. But as I explained back in April, this year’s selloff is different.

For the first time in 40 years, inflation is out of control. The Federal Reserve can’t cushion the falling market by slashing interest rates as it did in previous meltdowns.

Instead, the Fed has made clear it will continue to jack up rates until the surge in consumer prices moderates, even if that means causing a recession. By at least one measure — two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth — we are already in a recession despite near-record low unemployment.

“This is as challenging of an investment environment as any other time in history,” said Matthew Miskin, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management in Boston.

Miskin’s outlook wasn’t quite as dark when we spoke in April, but the mood on Wall Street has shifted. The focus is on hunkering down until the next bull market.

And let’s not forget that there is always another bull market.

“The thing with tough performance years of stocks and bonds,” he said last week, “is it usually sets up better years to come.”

But it takes time for bear markets to run their course. They have lasted an average of about one year since the end of World War II. As of Monday, we will be 273 days into this one. It could easily take well into 2023 before we see a turnaround.

It all depends on how long it takes the Fed to wrangle inflation, and whether it takes a recession to do so.

For now, consumer prices keep going in the wrong direction. After some signs of easing, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge climbed 4.9 percent over the year through August, after excluding volatile food and energy prices, the government reported Friday. That was a pickup from 4.7 percent in July. The central bank’s longer-term target is 2 percent.

In September, Fed officials boosted their benchmark interest rate to the range of 3 to 3.25 percent, up from near-zero in March. In their latest economic projections, they said the rate could reach 4.6 percent next year. That would be the highest since 2001.

While that obviously makes borrowing money more expensive, it also provides a money-making opportunity for haggard investors. Financial advisers say that after years of super-low interest rates, yields in the range of 4 to 6 percent on municipal and investment grade corporate bonds can be attractive. A six-month Treasury bill yields 3.9 percent, up from 0.2 percent at the start of the year.

Also gaining traction are so-called defensive stocks, including health care and utilities, that tend to perform better when the economy is down and out, and companies with strong balance sheets that can ride out a recession.

At unsettling times like these, perspective is especially important.

It may seem like the market is an endless roller coaster where we never get anywhere. But that’s not true.

Since I entered the workforce in 1984, the S&P 500 has returned an average of nearly 11 percent a year including dividends. My investing life has spanned five bear markets (a decline of 20 percent or more from the recent peak) and 12 corrections (a drop of at least 10 percent), including four that came within a millimeter of qualifying as a bear market.

For long-term investors, it’s an article of faith (from the Gospel according to Warren Buffett) that during market downdrafts you stay the course and pick up some good companies at bargain prices.

“There are still not too many places to hide,” said Howard Needle, a portfolio manager at Wellesley Asset Management and another of the investors I interviewed in April when the prices for stocks, bonds, crypto — everything, really — were getting pummeled.

“Having said that, prices of everything are much lower than they were four or five months ago,” he said.

A chance to “buy stuff cheap,” as Needle put it, can be rewarding, but steadily appreciating markets are better.

You know what else is important? Having a plan.

For savers with 20 or 30 years or even longer until retirement, there will be plenty of opportunities to recoup this year’s losses. Don’t throw your investment plan overboard in the middle of the storm.

To be sure, it’s a lot harder to be sanguine for folks getting close to the day when they have to start withdrawing from their retirement accounts.

“There’s no sugar-coating it from a timing standpoint,” said Austin Litvak, director of investment research at O’Brien Wealth Partners in Boston.

Litvak repeated what he’d told me in April: It’s important to put a financial plan in place well before the markets go south.

“If you haven’t, it’s never too late to start to build one,” he said. But the longer you wait, the less flexibility you might have “to retire on the timeline you were hoping for.”

Meanwhile, market pros and amateur investors alike are being punished, with $12.6 trillion in market value disappearing since the start of the year, based on the Wilshire 5000 index.

The outlook for corporate earnings is the main driver of the stock market. Slow or no economic growth doesn’t bode well for profits, and inflation eats away at the present value of future earnings.

Unless you went all in on energy stocks — which took off along with the surge in oil and gas prices that helped set a fire under inflation — you are almost certainly staring at double-digit losses on your brokerage statements and retirement account summaries.

Those big-name tech companies that everyone piled into because of their fantastic profit prospects? Clobbered.

Meta, the parent of Facebook, has tumbled nearly 60 percent this year. Netflix. Amazon, and Alphabet, the parent of Google, have lost about one-third of their value. Apple is the “outperformer” with a loss of 22 percent.

Pick a sector other than energy — financials, consumer staples, industrials, real estate, health care — they are all in the red this year. Just 71 stocks in the S&P 500 are in the black.

Corporate and government bonds also continued to get drubbed. That’s to be expected when interest rates are climbing and investors sell older bonds to lock in better yields on newer issues.

But in the past stocks and bonds didn’t usually crater at the same time. So the “downside” protection that bonds typically offer when stocks sell off has mostly evaporated, deepening losses.

In the spring, there was more optimism among investors and economists that the Fed could engineer a soft landing — choking off inflation without croaking the economy. That led to the summer relief rally — until Fed chair Jerome Powell lowered the boom during an August speech at a central bankers’ conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo.

“Restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for some time,” Powell said. “The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy.”

That wiped away any hope that inflation was peaking and the Fed could soon pause raising rates.

Now nearly everyone believes a hard landing is the most likely scenario.

So here we are again. Hold tight. Stick with your plan. And with time — and some luck — we’ll get through it.

04869238-60d5-4eef-94e5-10b33e529883,"Caution: The stock market’s explosive rise in the past two days doesn’t necessarily mean the bear market is over.

If anything, the rally suggests that the bear market is alive and well.

How so?

It’s because daily spikes happen more frequently during bear than bull markets. So if you had to bet on the market’s major trend while knowing nothing more than the fact of the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s DJIA, +2.18% 700-plus-point increases in each of Monday and Tuesday’s trading sessions, your bet would have to be that the trend remains down.

Consider what I found upon analyzing the distribution of the 100 biggest daily percentage S&P 500 SPX, +3.09% gains since 1928. You’d be excused for thinking that such big trading days occur randomly, since daily market gyrations are often considered to be little more than statistical noise.

But if they did occur randomly, you’d expect that, statistically, only 30 of those 100 increases would have taken place during bear markets.

In fact, 58% have occurred during bear markets. That’s nearly twice what you’d expect if such gains occurred randomly, as you can see from the accompanying chart, below.

‘Perfect examples’

This bear-market concentration of big daily gains is even more pronounced for the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +4.41% , according to a report from Cornell Capital.

The firm focused on the last three Nasdaq bear markets prior to this year: These are the bear markets that occurred from 2000 to 2002, 2007 to 2009, and from February to March 2020. Just 8% of the trading days since the Nasdaq Composite Index was created in 1971 have occurred during these three bear markets.

Nevertheless, according to Cornell Capital’s analysis, 80% of the 40 biggest one-day rallies in the Nasdaq Composite occurred during one of those three bear markets. That’s 10 times what you’d expect on the assumption that rallies occur randomly.

The implications of this Cornell Capital report for today’s market are disturbing. In an email, Bradford Cornell, an emeritus finance professor at UCLA and a senior adviser to the firm, told me that the rallies on Monday and Tuesday of this week are “perfect examples” of what he wrote about in that report.

The rally “does not necessarily mean that the bad times are over,” he said.

cd44b0c0-512d-4075-a1d4-4702b2526629,"U.S. stocks charged sharply higher Tuesday as Wall Street built on momentum from a broad market rally that kicked off the month and quarter earlier this week.

[Click here to read what's moving markets on Wednesday, Oct. 5]

The benchmark S&P 500 surged 3%, its largest two-day climb since April 2020 — with the strongest daily breadth reading since late 2018, per data from Bespoke Investment Group. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 826 points, or 2.8%, for its second straight day of gains of more than 700 points. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite soared 3.2%.

All eyes were on Elon Musk's charade with Twitter (TWTR) Tuesday after Bloomberg reported the Tesla (TSLA) CEO agreed to move forward with his $44 billion deal to buy the social media platform. Shares of Twitter spiked 12% immediately following the news before trading was temporarily halted — and they closed up over 22% after trading resumed. Musk confidentially filed a letter with the Delaware Chancery Court Monday night to proceed with the acquisition, days before he was expected to be deposed as part of Twitter's lawsuit.

""We received the letter from the Musk parties which they have filed with the SEC,"" Twitter said in a statement Tuesday afternoon. ""The intention of the company is to close the transaction at $54.20 per share.""

As stocks soared broadly, investors cheered on a fresh labor market reading that showed U.S. job openings slid by the most in nearly two and a half years in August — a welcome sign for Federal Reserve officials trying to tamp down outsized labor demand in the fight against inflation. The Labor Department said in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) that job openings dropped 1.1 million to 10.1 million on the last business day of August.

Bonds rallied alongside stocks on Tuesday, with Treasury yields falling for a second straight day. The benchmark U.S. 10-year note tumbled to around 3.6% after topping a 2008 high of 4% last week. The U.S. dollar index also fell lower.

Story continues

Equity markets kicked off the month on a high note Monday after an ugly September for the major averages. During the previous session, the S&P 500 soared 2.6% in its best day since July, the Dow rose 2.7% to mark its largest one-day gain since June, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 2.3%.

Nicholas Colas of DataTrek Research points out that the S&P 500 rarely rallies by over 2% in non-stressed market conditions, suggesting that Monday’s bounce was a sign of “fragility, not strength.” Between 2013 and 2019, for example, there were fewer than four such days in every year, while 2022 has had 14 so far.

“History strongly suggests that Monday’s 2.6% S&P rally is neither healthy nor a sign that the index has troughed,” Cola said, adding that reducing outsized volatility of the sort we have been seeing this year requires a shift by policymakers. “Markets have been trying to predict a turning point for Fed policy for months now, with as-yet little success given the ongoing strength in U.S. labor markets and still-high inflation.”

A gauge of U.S. manufacturing from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Monday showed activity declined to the lowest since May 2020 – a contraction that stoked some optimism around a dovish Federal Reserve pivot. And adding to hopes central bankers may back off aggressive monetary intervention was a warning from a United Nations agency that policymakers may induce a global recession and a period of prolonged stagnation if they proceed with aggressive rate increases.

""Excessive monetary tightening could usher in a period of stagnation and economic instability,"" the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) said in a statement.

Elsewhere on the corporate side, shares of Rivian (RIVN) rallied nearly 14% after the company reiterated it was still on track to produce 25,000 electric vehicles this year, affirming its previous guidance.

Poshmark (POSH) stock jumped 13% on news the second-hand fashion retailer is set to be acquired by South Korean internet giant Naver Corp. in a deal valued at $1.2 billion.

Oil also extended Monday’s gains after a report OPEC+ is mulling a hefty production cut. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent crude oil futures each rose more than 3% to $86.44 and $91.86 per barrel, respectively.

27419ee9-3345-41af-b06e-5818ba55a089,"Wall Street's major indexes closed lower on Thursday as concerns mounted ahead of closely watched monthly non-farm payrolls numbers that the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate stance will lead to a recession.

Markets briefly took comfort from data that showed weekly jobless claims rose by the most in four months last week, raising some hopes the Fed could ease the implementation since March of the fastest and highest jump in rates in decades.

The equity market has been slow to acknowledge a consistent message from Fed officials that rates will go higher for longer until the pace of inflation is clearly slowing.

Chicago Fed President Charles Evans was the latest to spell out the central bank's outlook on Thursday, saying policymakers expect to deliver 125 basis points of rate hikes before year's end as inflation readings have been disappointing.

""The market has been slowly getting the Fed's message,"" said Jason Pride, chief investment officer for private wealth at Glenmede in Philadelphia.

""There's a likelihood that the Fed with further rate hikes pushes the economy into a recession in order to bring inflation down,"" Pride said.

""We don't think the markets have fully picked up on this.""

Pride said that the average recession has seen a 15 per cent decline in earnings.

Despite the day's decline, the three major indexes were poised to post a weekly gain after the sharp rally on Monday and Tuesday.

The labour market remains tight even as demand begins to cool amid higher rates. On Friday the nonfarm payrolls report on employment in September will help investors gauge whether the Fed alters its aggressive rate-hiking plans.

Money markets are pricing in an almost 86 per cent chance of a fourth straight 75 basis-point rate hike when policymakers meet on November 1 and 2.

To be clear, not everyone foresees a hard landing.

Dave Sekera, chief US market strategist at Morningstar Inc , said growth will remain sluggish for the foreseeable future and likely will not start to re-accelerate until the second half of 2023, but he does not see a sharp downturn.

""We're not forecasting a recession,"" Sekera said.

""The markets are looking for clarity as to when they think economic activity will re-accelerate and make that sustained rebound.

""They're also looking for strong evidence that inflation will begin to really trend down, moving back towards the Fed's two per cent target,"" he said.

Ten of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors fell, led by real estate , as almost all indexes were in the red, including semiconductors and small caps. The decline in value stocks was about double the drop in growth shares .

According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 lost 38.94 points, or 1.03 per cent, to end at 3,744.34 points, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 73.71 points, or 0.68 per cent, to 11,074.93. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 349.04 points, or 1.15 per cent, to 29,924.83.

Oil prices rose, holding at three-week highs after the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries plus its allies agreed to cut production targets by 2 million barrels per day (bpd), the largest reduction since 2020."
386efec4-9bfb-480c-b594-6c19b04e27e3,"Wall Street rallied for a second straight day to end higher on Tuesday after softer US economic data and a smaller-than-expected interest rate hike by the Australian central bank stirred hope that the Federal Reserve might temper its aggressive raising of rates.

While labour demand remains fairly strong, US job openings fell by the most in nearly two-and-a-half years in August in a sign the Fed's mission to tame inflation by tightening policy was working to slow the economy.

Earlier, the Reserve Bank of Australia surprised markets with a smaller-than-expected interest rate hike of 25 basis points. Its cash rate rose to a nine-year peak after six rate hikes in as many months in a tightening cycle other central banks are engaged in too.

The RBA is the first major central bank to recognise that now is the time to slow down after aggressively raising rates this year, said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan.

""There's hope that the Federal Reserve at some point in the fourth quarter will say the same thing. Not stop raising interest rates, but just slow the pace,"" he said.

""That's what the market's kind of rallying on below the surface.""

Still, Fed Gov. Philip Jefferson said inflation is the most serious problem facing the US central bank and it ""may take some time"" to address. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said the central bank needs to deliver more rate hikes.

Rate-sensitive tech stocks rose as yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury fell for a second day in a row after the jobs data and RBA's surprise move. Valuations on tech and other growth stocks fall when their cost of capital rises.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 posted their biggest two-day rallies since April 2020.

The repercussions of higher rates will likely be reflected in corporate results when earnings season begins in two weeks, said Dennis Dick, founder and market structure analyst at Triple D Trading Inc.

""We're still in for a tougher time here. I do think this earnings season is going to not be good,"" he said.

""If one of the big guns warns that could end the rally rather quickly. This is just a relief really as opposed to the start of a new bull market.""

Billionaire Elon Musk proposed going ahead with his original offer of $US54.20 ($A83.34) to take Twitter Inc private, two sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday, sending the social media firm's shares surging. Tesla shares had been up about 6.0 per cent before the news and immediately cut gains, but ending up on the day.

The megacap titans of Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp, Apple Inc and Google parent Alphabet Inc led the rally.

According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 gained 112.84 points, or 3.09 per cent, to end at 3,791.27 points, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 360.97 points, or 3.34 per cent, to 11,174.20. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 823.27 points, or 2.81 per cent, to 30,314.16.

Banks such as Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs climbed more than 3.0 per cent.

The rally was broad, with just a dozen or so of the S&P 500 index trading in negative territory.

The rebound in stocks on Monday followed the S&P 500's lowest close in nearly two years last week that capped its worst monthly performance in September since March 2020.

Rivian Automotive Inc jumped after the electric-vehicle maker said it produced 7,363 units in the third quarter, 67 per cent more than the preceding quarter, and maintained its full-year target of 25,000."
3e9655d8-0cbd-4739-9899-7f745970e163,"Wall Street stocks closed lower on Wednesday, unable to sustain a late-day surge, after data showed US labour demand remained strong and as Federal Reserve officials stuck to their hawkish message that interest rates will stay higher for longer.

Stocks rebounded late in the day after data showed US labour demand remained strong. But Fed officials insisted rates would stay high to battle inflation, a message the market has feared would lead to a hard landing and likely recession.

""By battling back, to me that is a favourable indicator that this rally could have legs,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York.

""It too confirms that investors believe, traders believe, that there's still more to go in this rally,"" he said.

US private employers stepped up hiring in September, the ADP National Employment report on Wednesday showed, suggesting rising rates and tighter financial conditions have yet to curb labour demand as the Fed battles high inflation.

The Institute for Supply Management's services industry employment gauge shot up in another sign labour remains strong as the overall industry slowed modestly in September.

The Fed is expected to deliver a fourth consecutive 75-basis-point rate hike when policymakers meet November 1-2, the pricing of fed fund futures shows, according to CME's FedWatch tool.

San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told Bloomberg TV in an interview that inflation is problematic and that the US central bank would stay the course.

""The path is clear: we are going to raise rates to restrictive territory, then hold them there for a while,"" she said. ""We are committed to bringing inflation down, staying course until we are well and truly done.""

The benchmark S&P 500 index rose 5.7 per cent Monday and Tuesday as Treasury yields slid sharply on softer US economic data, the UK's turnaround on proposed tax cuts that roiled markets and Australia's smaller-than-expected rate hike.

Treasury yields shot up again on Wednesday after the economic data failed to bolster budding hopes the Fed might pivot to a less hawkish policy stance.

But the equity market was viewed as oversold and investors stepped in, Stovall said.

""Prices are basically saying we could be severely oversold and as a result, we should take advantage of it because we might be surprised down the road,"" he said.

According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 lost 9.81 points, or 0.20 per cent, to end at 3,783.65 points, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 30.59 points, or 0.27 per cent, to 11,145.81. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 58.24 points, or 0.14 per cent, to 30,258.08.

The energy sector led the market higher, followed by information technology and healthcare.

Energy sector jumped after the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies agreed to cut oil production the deepest since the COVID-19 pandemic began, curbing supply in an already tight market.

Twitter Inc lost momentum in line with its peers, a day after surging 22 per cent on billionaire Elon Musk's decision to proceed with his original $US44 billion ($A68 billion) bid to take the social media company private.

US stocks were mixed on Thursday morning, struggling to recover after Wednesday's session snapped two days of strong gains for the major indexes.

Investors were mulling the latest weekly jobless claims beat expectations, which rose to 219,00 compared to the expected 204,000. The data comes ahead of Friday's non-farm payroll report, which will be an important input for Fed watchers as the central bank monitors the labor market for signs that the economy is cooling.

Investors were also watching Treasury yields edge higher after falling this week on renewed projections that the Fed could soon pivot from its path of rate hike. The 10 year Treasury bond was up about four basis points on Thursday. The next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee will take place on November 1-2.

Meanwhile, oil prices were little changed after OPEC+ said it would slash production by 2 million barrels a day on Wednesday. Russia also threatened to cut its output if a US-led plan to cap the price of Russian oil goes forward.

US stocks opened higher Tuesday, building on Monday's strong rally, as investors hope that a the end of monetary tightening may be in sight.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened nearly 400 points higher, while the Nasdaq surged more than 2%. The US dollar slid further on renewed strength in the pound after the UK government backpedaled a plan to cut taxes for high earners.

SINGAPORE, Oct 5 (Reuters) - The deputy head of Credit Suisse's (CSGN.S) Asia-Pacific wealth management business Young Jin Yee has resigned, according to a company memo reviewed by Reuters and confirmed by a spokesperson for the Swiss bank.

The departure comes at a time when concerns about Credit Suisse's ability to restructure its business without tapping investors for more money has battered the bank's shares to record lows.

Some of the bank's wealth management clients have recently become concerned about its turnaround, two people familiar with the discussions have told Reuters, and some have been moving funds, according to one of the people. The division is expected to be the centerpiece of the bank's turnaround plan.

The memo on Young sent on Wednesday from Benjamin Cavalli, the head of wealth management for Asia Pacific, to staff in that unit said Young would be leaving to ""pursue an expanded opportunity outside of Credit Suisse"".

Young, who is also the Singapore location head of the bank's wealth business, was appointed to her role in January and had been with the bank for nearly two decades. She was also the CEO of SymAsia Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Credit Suisse.

The bank has insisted its capital and liquidity are strong, saying it will have more to say about a strategic revamp when it releases third-quarter results on Oct. 27.

""As mentioned by our group CEO, we are in a healthy capital and liquidity position,"" Cavalli said in an email response to a Reuters query.

Credit Suisse Group AG's deputy wealth-management boss in Asia will step down, adding her name to a list of senior executives in the region that have left the troubled bank in recent months.

Young Jin Yee, the Swiss lender's deputy head of wealth management in the Asia-Pacific region, will leave to pursue an opportunity outside Credit Suisse, according to an internal memo seen by Dow Jones Newswires on Wednesday and confirmed by the company."
0fb7ee8c-7cdb-418d-a1ea-8f5a92716420,"Stocks rose sharply on Tuesday, lifting the S&P 500 index to its third-best start to an October since 1930, according to FactSet.

The benchmark index has rallied since hitting its lowest point of the year on Friday to close out a September slump. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 soared 3.1%, which followed Monday's 2.6% gain.

Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average soared more than 1,500 points in two days, including a 2.8% jump Tuesday. Other indices also gained, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumping 2.7%.

The two-day rally is hitting markets as investors look for signs that central banks might ease up on their aggressive rate hikes aimed at taming the hottest inflation in four decades. Despite the broad gains, the major indexes remain in a bear market after falling 20% or more from their most recent record highs.

Investors are cheered by signs that the Federal Reserve's regime of rate hikes may be putting the brakes on a hot labor market and economy that has sparked the highest inflation in four decades, he noted. On Tuesday, the government said the number of available jobs in the U.S. plummeted in August compared with July. It's a sign that businesses may pull back further on hiring and that chronically high inflation could soon cool.

""What's happened over the last two sessions is NOT just a 'bear-market rally' and people who label it as such risk missing additional upside,"" said Adam Crisafulli in a Tuesday research note.

He added that recent data including the decline in job openings are ""pointing to the type of downward labor inflection point the Fed has been yearning to see.""

""Bear market rallies""

Still, the optimism could be misguided as inflation remains stubbornly hot, said John Lynch, chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth Management.

""Investors should be worried about false positives,"" he said. ""Be wary of the history of bear market rallies, they can be very seductive.""

Major indexes could be in store for more declines ahead, he said, as more economic data and the next round of earnings reports paints a clearer picture of how inflation continues to impact business operations and consumer spending.

Treasury yields continued to pull back from their multiyear highs, which has helped relieve some of the pressure on stocks. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which helps set rates for mortgages and many other kinds of loans, fell to 3.61% from 3.65% late Monday. It got as high as 4% last week after starting the year at just 1.51%.

The yield on the two-year Treasury, which more closely tracks expectations for Federal Reserve action, fell to 4.09% from 4.12% late Monday.

Cruise line operators were the biggest gainers among S&P 500 stocks. Norwegian Cruise Line jumped 16.7%, Royal Caribbean surged 17% and Carnival gained 13.7%.

Investors are watching closely as central banks raise interest rates to make borrowing more difficult and slow economic growth to try to tame inflation. Investors are hoping that they will eventually ease off their aggressive rate hikes and the move by Australia's central bank is a hopeful sign for some.

Wall Street is worried that the rate hikes, especially the increases from the Fed, could go too far in slowing growth and send economies into a recession. The Fed has already pushed its key overnight interest rate to a range of 3% to 3.25%, up from virtually zero as recently as March.

Economic growth is already slowing globally and the U.S. economy contracted during the first two quarters of the year, which is considered an informal signal of a recession. The economy still has several strong pockets, including employment. Wall Street will get a more detailed look at the employment situation in the U.S. when the government releases its monthly jobs report for September on Friday."
386efec4-9bfb-480c-b594-6c19b04e27e3,"Wall Street rallied for a second straight day to end higher on Tuesday after softer US economic data and a smaller-than-expected interest rate hike by the Australian central bank stirred hope that the Federal Reserve might temper its aggressive raising of rates.

While labour demand remains fairly strong, US job openings fell by the most in nearly two-and-a-half years in August in a sign the Fed's mission to tame inflation by tightening policy was working to slow the economy.

Earlier, the Reserve Bank of Australia surprised markets with a smaller-than-expected interest rate hike of 25 basis points. Its cash rate rose to a nine-year peak after six rate hikes in as many months in a tightening cycle other central banks are engaged in too.

The RBA is the first major central bank to recognise that now is the time to slow down after aggressively raising rates this year, said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan.

""There's hope that the Federal Reserve at some point in the fourth quarter will say the same thing. Not stop raising interest rates, but just slow the pace,"" he said.

""That's what the market's kind of rallying on below the surface.""

Still, Fed Gov. Philip Jefferson said inflation is the most serious problem facing the US central bank and it ""may take some time"" to address. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said the central bank needs to deliver more rate hikes.

Rate-sensitive tech stocks rose as yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury fell for a second day in a row after the jobs data and RBA's surprise move. Valuations on tech and other growth stocks fall when their cost of capital rises.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 posted their biggest two-day rallies since April 2020.

The repercussions of higher rates will likely be reflected in corporate results when earnings season begins in two weeks, said Dennis Dick, founder and market structure analyst at Triple D Trading Inc.

""We're still in for a tougher time here. I do think this earnings season is going to not be good,"" he said.

""If one of the big guns warns that could end the rally rather quickly. This is just a relief really as opposed to the start of a new bull market.""

Billionaire Elon Musk proposed going ahead with his original offer of $US54.20 ($A83.34) to take Twitter Inc private, two sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday, sending the social media firm's shares surging. Tesla shares had been up about 6.0 per cent before the news and immediately cut gains, but ending up on the day.

The megacap titans of Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp, Apple Inc and Google parent Alphabet Inc led the rally.

According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 gained 112.84 points, or 3.09 per cent, to end at 3,791.27 points, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 360.97 points, or 3.34 per cent, to 11,174.20. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 823.27 points, or 2.81 per cent, to 30,314.16.

Banks such as Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs climbed more than 3.0 per cent.

The rally was broad, with just a dozen or so of the S&P 500 index trading in negative territory.

The rebound in stocks on Monday followed the S&P 500's lowest close in nearly two years last week that capped its worst monthly performance in September since March 2020.

Rivian Automotive Inc jumped after the electric-vehicle maker said it produced 7,363 units in the third quarter, 67 per cent more than the preceding quarter, and maintained its full-year target of 25,000."
8377234e-087e-41ec-91c6-886f80430a9d,"U.S. stocks kicked off the fourth quarter with strong back-to-back gains earlier this week, with the S&P 500 jumping more than 5.7% off its 2022 low, helping investors claw back some of its crushing 9.3% loss in September.

However, strategists warn the strong rally to start the quarter doesn’t mean investors are out of the woods yet, particularly with Friday’s employment report for September likely to offer important guidance to the Federal Reserve at its next policy meeting in early November.

See: Hiring and job creation seen falling to 1 1/2-year low in September

Lindsey Bell, chief markets and money strategist at Ally, thinks the data may offer a glimpse of the short-term direction for equities. Friday’s employment report is expected to show the economy added 275,000 jobs for the month, compared with 315,000 new positions added in August, according to a survey polled by Dow Jones.

“The expectation is that the report will be goldilocks in nature — not too hot and not too cold,” Bell wrote in a note on Tuesday, adding that the jobs data will need to be in line with, or short of expectations, in order for the stock market to continue higher.

Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, sees equity prices being volatile if we get a “really strong jobs report,” which may have a negative impact on stock prices. “Too many people making too much money, [means they] keep spending money. That keeps prices high, and that means, ultimately, interest rates will be higher for longer,” said Mulberry via phone on Wednesday.

Investor would want to see a monthly decline, with more jobs lost in the economy each month, but “we’re not seeing that materialize yet,” according to Mulberry. As a result, the economy is getting to the target Fed fund rate quicker than previously thought because “we’re not having a job erosion that we want to see.”

Job openings in the U.S. fell sharply in August to a 13-month low of 10.1 million, the Labor Department said on Tuesday, a sign the red-hot labor market might be cooling off a bit as high inflation and rapidly rising interest rates start to rattle the economy. On Monday, the Institute for Supply Management said its closely watched manufacturing index fell to a 28-month low of 50.9% in September, its lowest level in more than two years.

However, Bell explained that the weak economic data doesn’t necessarily mean the central bank will become less aggressive with its interest-rate-hike plans, in a follow up interview with MarketWatch.

“Investors are viewing that as a little bit of a relief, though I don’t know that you can read into it that it’s going to lead to the Fed making a pivot or pausing policy at their next meeting,” Bell said via phone. “I think there’s still a lot to be determined before they make that call.”

US stocks opened higher Tuesday, building on Monday's strong rally, as investors hope that a the end of monetary tightening may be in sight.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened nearly 400 points higher, while the Nasdaq surged more than 2%. The US dollar slid further on renewed strength in the pound after the UK government backpedaled a plan to cut taxes for high earners.

The market’s gains come as major indexes remain in a bear market after falling 20% or more from their most recent record highs. The two-day rally is hitting markets as investors look for signs that central banks might ease up on their aggressive rate hikes aimed at taming the hottest inflation in four decades.

Australia’s central bank made an interest rate hike that was smaller than previous ones, and that helped Australia’s market jump 3.8%. It is a potentially positive signal for investors, along with the latest jobs data from the U.S.

Investors in the U.S. received potentially encouraging news from a government report on job openings that showed the number of available jobs in the U.S. plummeted in August compared with July. It’s a sign that businesses may pull back further on hiring and potentially cool chronically high inflation.

The optimism could be misguided, however, as inflation remains stubbornly high, said John Lynch, chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth Management.

“Investors should be worried about false positives,” he said. “Be wary of the history of bear market rallies, they can be very seductive.”

Major indexes could be in for more declines, he said, as more economic data and the next round of earnings reports paint a clearer picture of how inflation continues to affect business operations and consumer spending.

The S&P 500 rose 112.50 points to 3,790.93, while the Dow gained 825.43 points to close at 30,316.32. The Nasdaq rose 360.97 points to 11,176.41, and the Russell 2000 added 66.90 points, ending at 1,775.77.

Treasury yields continued to pull back from their multiyear highs, which has helped relieve some of the pressure on stocks. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which helps set rates for mortgages and many other kinds of loans, slipped to 3.64% from 3.65% late Monday. It got as high as 4% last week after starting the year at just 1.51%.

The yield on the two-year Treasury, which more closely tracks expectations for Federal Reserve action, fell to 4.10% from 4.12% late Monday.

The market was mostly quiet ahead of the next round of corporate earnings reports.

Cruise line operators were among the biggest gainers in the S&P 500. Norwegian Cruise Line jumped 16.8%, Royal Caribbean surged 16.7% and Carnival gained 13.3%.

If those reports point to a still strong job market, that could trigger a bond market sell-off, which would weigh on stocks, said Jay Hatfield, chief executive of Infrastructure Capital Advisors.

89e31a36-a134-4b54-abc2-c2aaa0db5b78,"‘Idea meritocracy’ Dalio was a former commodities trader and broker when he founded Bridgewater from his two-bedroom New York City apartment in 1975. Thanks to standout performance in the 2000s, the firm amassed tens of billions of dollars in assets and landed many of the biggest institutions as clients. Connecticut-based Bridgewater also became so notorious for secrecy and iconoclasm that it drew comparisons to a cult. From its humble beginnings, Dalio built Bridgewater into a Wall Street powerhouse. Credit:AP The place certainly was unusual. Dalio wanted to create an “idea meritocracy” and believed the best way to achieve it was through “radical truthfulness and radical transparency.” Open disagreement was encouraged, so-called baseball cards rated employees on attributes such as believability, and meetings were recorded.

When Dalio decided more than a decade ago to set Bridgewater’s succession in motion, “I was just running things,” he recalled. “We didn’t have a board or even an idea of how you establish good governance.” Revolving door It proved to be much harder than he expected. Over the following decade, seven different people at various times held the title of sole or co-CEO. Only in the past year did Bridgewater’s new ranks of leadership and governance finally come together. In December, the firm revealed the membership of its board. And in January, when David McCormick resigned to pursue a seat in the US Senate, it named Bar Dea and Mark Bertolini to succeed him as co-CEOs.

“It was a challenge along the way because Ray had strong views on how things should go,” said Greg Jensen, who joined Bridgewater as an intern in 1996, served as CEO in the early 2010s and is now co-CIO with Bob Prince. While many of its rivals posted record gains as the pandemic took hold in 2020, Bridgewater lagged behind, leading to a review of the company’s strategy. Credit:Bloomberg At a hedge fund, lousy performance is often the catalyst for change. While rivals such as Brevan Howard Asset Management and Rokos Capital Management had record gains in 2020, Bridgewater’s Pure Alpha lost almost 13 per cent. That was on top of comparatively poor returns in the 2010s. Hints of change For a firm so confident that it had cultivated the best investing talent, the results were a shock. In the exhaustive review and analysis that followed, Bridgewater came to realise that several of its methods were constraining creativity and collaboration rather than surfacing the best ideas, according to Jensen.

“The goal is to get people to speak their mind,” he said. “Some of those tools worked to pull out the truth and some of them didn’t.” As a result, the baseball cards, for example, no longer try to capture and predict every characteristic and quality in the effort to rate an employee’s input. The focus now is narrower and more practical, Jensen explained. He also hinted at more changes to come. Now that control rests with the board, Bridgewater is likely to invest more aggressively in technology and in people – even if Dalio objects, he said. ‘Beautiful thing’ In conversation, Dalio projects an aura of contentment and relays a sense of relief.

Succession means he can devote more time to his philanthropy and to passing on the lessons he’s learned as a lifelong student of the economy. He said he has no plans to sell his minority stake in Bridgewater and looks forward to mentoring the firm’s investors for years to come. Loading It hasn’t been as easy for Dalio’s cohort on Wall Street to let go. At Blackstone, the world’s largest manager of alternative assets, 75-year-old Steve Schwarzman remains chairman and CEO. At KKR & Co., Henry Kravis, 78, and George Roberts, 79, are still co-chairman. And at Carlyle Group Inc., co-founder Bill Conway, 73, recently stepped back in as interim CEO when the firm ousted 57-year-old Kewsong Lee. If Dalio misses being the boss, he’s not letting on."
12778377-6621-4d77-9800-810f41d15a16,"Billionaire investor Ray Dalio announced Tuesday that he is giving up control of Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund.

Why it matters: This is the final step in Dalio relieving control of the firm he founded, transitioning $150 billion in assets to the next generation of leaders.

Driving the news: Dalio gave up his voting powers to the board of directors on Sept. 30, stepping down from his spot as one of the company's three co-chief investment officers, per Bloomberg.

Dalio founded the firm in 1975.

""Today is a very special day for me and Bridgewater Associates because I transitioned my control of Bridgewater to the next generation and I feel great about the people and 'machine' now in control. This transition moment is the culmination of a 47-year journey,"" Dalio said in a tweet Tuesday.

""Hopefully until I die, I will continue to be a mentor, an investor, and board member at Bridgewater, because I and they love doing those things together. That's a dream come true,"" he added.

What they're saying: Nir Bar Dea and Mark Bertolini, co-CEOs of Bridgewater, said in a letter to employees on Oct. 4 that Dalio's transition out of management was complete.

The co-CEOS said Dalio will stay on as a CIO mentor and an operating board member.

53a1e022-b239-4497-9601-990627f3c3af,"For years, Ray Dalio has made his disdain for cash abundantly clear.

The founder and co-chief investment officer of Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund, told everyone who would listen that cash was trash, a point he repeated to the MarketWatch “Best New Ideas In Money” festival just two weeks ago. Dalio said cash was still a “trash investment,” though perhaps he showed signs of tweaking his long-held worldview, as he said the true utility of cash depends on how it compares to others.

Now, he’s changed his mind. “I no longer think cash is trash,” said Dalio, in a late Monday tweet. “At existing interest rates and with the Fed shrinking the balance sheet, it is now about neutral—neither a very good or very bad deal. In other words, the short-term interest rate is now about right.”

This is a view that investment bank Morgan Stanley has been espousing for some time. At virtually no risk, the 6-month Treasury bill BX:TMUBMUSD06M on Tuesday morning yielded just under 4%. That compares to the 1.74% dividend yield on the S&P 500 SPX, the 3.57% yield on the 10-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD10Y and the 2% yield on the iShares Core U.S. aggregate bond ETF AGG.

Granted, if the market turns higher, cash will be left behind. That’s the risk/return tradeoff. Stocks rallied on Monday and stock futures were stronger early Tuesday. Dalio typically has a defter touch than, say, Jim Cramer, but perhaps his throwing in the towel on cash is the sign that now is the time to get out of it and put money to work.

Ray Dalio, the billionaire investor who built Bridgewater Associates into one of the world's biggest hedge funds, has handed over control of the $150 billion firm to a new generation of investors, Bridgewater said on Tuesday.

Dalio has transferred his majority stake to the board but remains a ""meaningful"" owner of the $150 billion hedge fund, the company said. He has stepped down as one of three co-chief investment officers and will have a new title the firm said: founder and CIO mentor.

The 73-year-old billionaire stepped down as Bridgewater's chief executive officer in 2017 and chairman at the end of 2021, following which the prolific hedge fund manager served in his current role focusing on mentoring the committee that has oversight over the firm's investment strategies.

Dalio, who founded Bridgewater in 1975, will now hold a position as a member of the operating board, senior investor and as a mentor to the firm's CIOs.

Ray Dalio, founder of the biggest hedge fund ($150 billion) in the world, is giving up control of his company after nearly 50 years, Hope writes.

Why it matters: From creating the firm's infamous feedback culture, to growing its funds' historical performance and size, Dalio helped define Wall Street's aspirational mystique for multiple generations.

Driving the news: Bridgewater Associates Tuesday announced the conclusion of a succession and transition plan, 12 years in the making.

Dalio, 73, transferred all of his voting rights (at one point 95%) to the board at the end of September and stepped down as one of three co-chief investment officers.

He will keep his seat on the board and assume ""founder and CIO mentor"" as his new title.

The big picture: Succession planning and letting go are hard.

Dalio stepped down as co-CEO in 2017 and chairman at the end of last year.

However, Dalio is still only neutral on the dollar, likely because of stubborn inflation.

Ray Dalio, after repeatedly proclaiming ""cash is trash"" in recent years, has warmed to the US dollar and now views it as a passable investment.

""The facts have changed and I've changed my mind about cash as an asset: I no longer think cash is trash,"" Dalio tweeted on Monday.

""At existing interest rates and with the Fed shrinking the balance sheet, it is now about neutral — neither a very good or very bad deal,"" he continued. ""In other words, the short-term interest rate is now about right.""

The billionaire cofounder and co-chief investor of Bridgewater Associates dismissed cash as virtually worthless in April 2020, as he expected near-zero rates and a ballooning money supply to erode the value of dollars over time.

However, the Federal Reserve has hiked rates to upwards of 3% this year, and shifted from pumping dollars into the economy to reducing its bond holdings. As a result, interest rates on bank deposits are set to rise, rival assets are poised to perform relatively less well, and there's less pressure on the dollar from supply growth.

Therefore, Dalio is now less concerned about the dollar's value evaporating over time. The US dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other major world currencies, has surged 17% this year to a 20-year high.

The second part of Dalio's tweet suggests that he's content with the current fed funds range of 3% to 3.25%, and would grow more bullish on the dollar if rates climbed higher. He recently predicted long-term rates of more than 4.5%, indicating he sees further rate hikes in the years to come.

Still, the Bridgewater chief's tweet shows he has lingering doubts about the dollar. He's previously highlighted inflation — which hit a 40-year high of 9.1% in June and remains elevated — as a key threat, given that rising prices reduce the purchasing power of dollars.

""Of course cash is still trash,"" he said in May. ""Do you know how fast you're losing buying power?""

Dalio also suggested in April 2020 that the Fed wouldn't be able to raise rates high enough to compensate for inflation and generate a real return for investors. Given there's widespread worry about the central bank hiking further and inadvertently plunging the US economy into a recession next year, that remains a relevant concern.

It appears that Dalio is less bearish on cash in light of tighter monetary policy, but hasn't turned bullish given inflation remains high and there may be a limit on how high rates can go.

It's worth noting that Dalio's tweet hints at his views on other assets. If he's warmed to the dollar, that suggests he's less optimistic about non-cash assets than before, and sees the greenback holding onto its gains against rival currencies this year.

Oct 4 (Reuters) - Ray Dalio is known as much for his unique philosophy as for his investment performance. While his decision to relinquish control of Bridgewater, the world's largest hedge fund, marks a major transition for the storied firm, his influence will continue.

Bridgewater's Co-CEOs Nir Bar Dea and Mark Bertolini announced on Tuesday that the firm's transition from being a founder-led boutique to ""an enduring institution"" was complete, with the transfer of control of Bridgewater from Dalio to the operating board of directors.

That followed Dalio's transition out of management in 2017 and move in 2020 to mentor the investment committee, the firm said. Dalio, 73, will continue as a mentor, operating board member and remains an ""important part"" of Bridgewater's community, the firm said.

Dalio, whose fortune is estimated at $19.1 billion by Forbes magazine, helped pioneer a style of investing based on macro themes that aimed to beat the stock market through a dizzying array of financial instruments ranging from timber to Greek bonds to currency futures. As a result, Dalio is often known to converse knowledgeably about a wide range of world events and frequently posts essays on subjects including reforming capitalism, the growth of China, and the future of the cryptocurrency bitcoin.

At the same time, Dalio has often focused much of his attention on what the trends he observes in the financial markets said about human emotions. Employees at Bridgewater Associates have been encouraged to tear down each other’s ideas through unsparing critiques meant to leave the ego behind, a philosophy that Dalio described in his book, ""Principles: Life & Work,"" and an accompanying TED talk.

Dalio has defended the firm's unconventional management style, which was known for its relatively high turnover in which an estimated 25% of employees left within their first 18 months on the job.

""It is a culture, but it's the opposite of a cult,"" Dalio said at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Los Angeles in 2016.

Dalio, born in Jackson Heights, Queens as the only child of a jazz musician and a homemaker, began caddying for Wall Street investors at the age of eight in suburban Long Island where his family moved to, receiving stock tips in exchange. After shares of the first stock he purchased tripled, he ""figured this was an easy game,"" he told the New Yorker in 2011.

He built a stock portfolio worth several thousand dollars while studying finance at Long Island University and began exploring transcendental meditation after a trip to India by The Beatles popularized the practice in America. After graduating, he attended Harvard Business School and then worked as a commodities trader.

He founded Bridgewater in 1975 and later lived and worked out of a converted barn in Connecticut. Dalio's articles on how economic systems work caught the eye of several prominent employee pension funds, and he was soon managing money for institutions ranging from the World Bank to Eastman Kodak.

""He had a new way of thinking,"" Rusty Olson, the head of Kodak's pension plan, told the New Yorker. ""You get the same return, but you get a heck of a lot of beneficial diversification, too.""

Dalio's reputation for making money regardless of global economic trends was cemented in 2008, when his flagship fund, Pure Alpha, gained about 9.5% during the global financial crisis that sank several other prominent investors and pushed the S&P 500, the main U.S. stock benchmark, down nearly 40%.

His fund did not weather the coronavirus pandemic as well, however, and lost $12.1 billion during 2020 according to data from LCH Investments.

However, it has rebounded since. The Pure Alpha fund for the first three quarters of this year rose 35%, according to a source familiar with the fund.

Following the global financial crisis, Dalio began posting regular essays on LinkedIn in which he detailed his personal philosophy and offered solutions to social ills. Among his most famous was a 2019 paper in which he argued that widening income inequality and under-investment in public education ""pose an existential risk for the U.S.""

Video Transcript

AKIKO FUJITA: Billionaire investor Ray Dalio is no longer in control of Bridgewater Associates, officially stepping down today after transferring voting rights Friday. Dalio also making another pivot today, changing his mind on cash, saying in a string of tweets, cash is not trash anymore. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre. And Ines, we're talking about this pivot because for so long, his end of the argument has been that especially in an inflationary environment, the cash you hold is going to be worth less.

INES FERRE: Exactly, and that's what investors have been talking about since we saw inflation rising. And basically, Ray Dalio has, for a long time, as you said, Akiko, said that, look, you want to not be in cash. You want to have a diversified portfolio. He famously said that back in 2020. And now this is a big U-turn.

And as you said, saying, the facts have changed. I've changed my mind about cash as an asset. I no longer think cash is trash. And he said, at existing interest rates and with the Fed shrinking the balance sheet, it is now about neutral, neither a very good or a very bad deal. So in other words, the short-term interest rate is now about right.

Look, as investors understand that rising rates are going-- that rates are rising, this basically is punishing the borrowers. So rising rates punishes borrowers, and rising rates rewards savers. So now if you are in cash, it also depends on your time horizon.

I mean, I wrote a whole piece on Yahoo Finance about how much cash should investors have. And there's a little bit of a discrepancy among strategists about how much investors should have. But the bottom line is, is that as you're seeing asset prices coming down-- as interest rates are going up, asset prices are coming down. So having dry powder on the side is not bad.

Story continues

AKIKO FUJITA: Really quickly, though, it feels like a lot of analysts are saying, though, that it's not a bad idea to be holding cash in this environment. I mean, we're-- two-day rally aside--

INES FERRE: Exactly.

AKIKO FUJITA: --it hasn't been good for those who've been holding some of these equity assets.

INES FERRE: No, exactly. As we are seeing, this is a-- yes, a bear market rally that we're seeing right now. But if asset prices continue to go down you will want to have cash on the side because you will want to be able to buy those assets at cheaper prices.

AKIKO FUJITA: OK. Today, a lot of people maybe saying, maybe it's time to buy into the market. Ines Ferre, thanks so much for that."
d2869e3d-a45b-47b2-8a80-d94302733f5e,"A Treasury-chaired council charged with flagging risks to U.S. financial stability said the crypto industry poses several risks, without really conjecturing on what crypto could break beyond itself, or how bad it could get.

Why it matters: The report from the Financial Stability Oversight Council this week is the latest response to President Biden’s executive order, “Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets.” The issues it raised — some old, some new — could have an impact on new pivotal regulations to come.

First, the obvious: ""Currently, crypto-asset entities do not have a consistent or comprehensive regulatory framework,"" the report notes.

It's kind of a mess who supervises what, as the report details.

The intrigue: This is a threat to traditional institutions, the council argues.

Crypto firms can take advantage of the murkiness (despite the fact that many industry stakeholders complain about a lack of clear rules).

""Crypto-asset firms may also obtain competitive benefits and undermine traditional institutions by failing to comply with applicable regulations,"" the authors note (our emphasis added).

The big gap: What is or isn't a security in the digital asset market. But that issue has been well documented.

But the report illuminates how the uncertainty is dangerous for crypto exchanges as well as token issuers.

Of note: The report flags an interim report from the Basel Committee on Banking Standards, a global standard setter for bank regulation, which has been out since June. That report basically breaks crypto assets into four categories:

Tokens that represent some kind of real asset. There aren't many of these. Equity, for example, has rarely been tokenized, but maybe Pax Gold would count.

Tokens that track a peg, such as the dollar. Basically, stablecoins.

Cryptocurrencies that are big and regulated (basically, bitcoin and ether, for now)

Everything else. These ""would be subject to more stringent prudential standards,"" the report explains.

The big question on every entrepreneur's mind now is, will the regulations for that last category be so intense that no one can run a business that might grow into the third bucket.

Other gaps they noted:

Run risks. Obviously the report worries about stablecoins backed by dollars or other currencies, but it also notes that there could be runs on exchanges, which is a seldom discussed issue.

Obviously the report worries about stablecoins backed by dollars or other currencies, but it also notes that there could be runs on exchanges, which is a seldom discussed issue. Credit union vendors are unsupervised. ""As a result, interconnections with crypto-asset activities may be able to grow more easily through [credit union service organizations], relative to banks,"" the report warns.

Private funds' crypto investments aren't really supervised. The report seems to hint that this might need to change because funds do business with banks and banks might not know how much crypto exposure funds have.

In addition, risks around hidden and unchecked leverage, and shortcomings in the monitoring of markets for bitcoin and ether it calls them ""crypto-assets that are not securities,"" but those are likely what they mean).

What's missing: The report seems to ignore the inherent transparency of blockchains. Obviously not everything in crypto is in the open (see Three Arrows and Celsius), but there's so much about the market that is.

Our thought bubble: The report says what it's afraid of, but not really why. Without even taking a stab at that piece, it's harder to take the threat seriously."

Video Transcript

[AUDIO LOGO]

- The Treasury Department's Financial Stability Oversight Council is issuing a new report saying cryptocurrencies could pose risks to the financial system without proper regulation and oversight. Yahoo Finance's Jen Schonberger has the details for us. Hey, Jen.

JENNIFER SCHONBERGER: Hey, good afternoon. That's exactly right. The Financial Stability Oversight Council warning in a brand new report that cryptocurrencies could pose risks to the financial system if they are allowed to grow in scale and connection to the traditional banking sector without proper oversight. Now, FSOC, which, of course, was created following the financial crisis to monitor threats to the financial system, says that potential drops in crypto prices, financial exposures between crypto firms, the risk of runs, and the use of leverage are all risks to the financial system.

The report says crypto prices appear to be primarily driven by speculation rather than grounded in current fundamental economics. Now, the council views stablecoins as the most pressing risk right now. And according to the report, many crypto asset activities lack basic rules to protect against the risk of runs or prevent high levels of leverage. It goes on to say that a lack of uniform regulations allow crypto firms to take advantage of gaps in the regulatory system.

The report also notes that while interconnections with the traditional banking system are currently limited, they could potentially increase rapidly, though overall, balance sheet exposure of banks to crypto remains limited. Now, to rein in these risks, FSOC recommends that Congress pass new legislation regulating the spot market for crypto. As well, they would like Congress to pass new legislation to regulate stablecoins. And they also want agencies to enforce existing rules to govern crypto and work together to fill regulatory gaps.

Now, FSOC just adjourning a meeting moments ago where they passed these regulations. This report coming at the direction of President Biden, who issued an executive order back in March ordering agencies across the government to study crypto and come up with ways to regulate them. Guys.

- All right. Jen Schonberger, thanks so much for that report."
031db55a-b1cc-46cb-a501-dae38645abf4,"The Financial Stability Oversight Council warned that cryptocurrencies could pose risks to the financial system if their overall scale or link with traditional banking grows without regulation and oversight.

“The rapid growth of digital asset activities, including stablecoins and lending and borrowing on digital assets trading platforms, is an important emerging vulnerability,” the FSOC said in a new report Monday.

The FSOC — created following the financial crisis to monitor threats to the financial system — says potential drops in asset prices, financial exposures between crypto firms, funding mismatches and the risk of runs, and the use of leverage are all risks to the financial system.

Many crypto-asset activities lack basic rules to protect against the risk of runs or prevent high levels of leverage, according the report. Regulators say there are major gaps in the regulation of crypto assets. And since crypto firms lack consistent, uniform regulations, authorities say they can take advantage of gaps in the regulatory system.

“Crypto-asset prices appear to be primarily driven by speculation rather than grounded in current fundamental economics,” the report says.

The council — composed of the heads of major federal financial regulatory agencies, including Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and the Securities & Exchange Commission — views stablecoins as the most pressing risk. Regulators, who have voiced concerns about stablecoins as far back as last November, say stablecoins are susceptible to runs if not regulated with capital and liquidity standards. Officials point to the run on algorithmic stablecoin TerraUST this spring that led to a separate, though less severe run, on Tether, the largest stablecoin measured by market cap.

Authorities also see vulnerability where stablecoin issuers hold assets in the traditional financial system. They say traditional asset markets could experience dislocations if stablecoin activities were to reach significant scale and if runs on stablecoins were to lead to fire sales of traditional assets like Treasuries or commercial paper backing the stablecoins.

The report notes that while interconnections with the traditional financial system are relatively limited, they could potentially increase rapidly. Officials offer the example where banks could increase exposures to crypto markets through lending and securing loans with crypto assets. It notes, though, that overall, the level of involvement by the banking system in crypto is “relatively low” right now and banks’ overall balance sheet exposure to crypto remains limited.

Another area regulators point to as a glaring gap: limited direct federal oversight of the spot market for crypto assets that are not securities. The report notes markets may not have strong rules to ensure orderly and transparent trading, prevent conflicts of interest and market manipulation, and protect investors and the economy more broadly.

Given the risks, FSOC offers 10 recommendations to rein in the risks of crypto, including Congress passing new legislation to give regulators authority over the spot market for crypto assets that aren’t securities; legislation to regulate stablecoins; and legislation that would give regulators authority to see across a crypto firm’s full business that has multiple subsidiaries operating under different regulations.

The report also encourages agencies to continue to enforce existing rules and regulations and coordinate with each other to regulate crypto companies, such as stablecoin issuers or crypto-asset platforms, particularly in cases where different players with similar activities may be subject to different regulations.

This report comes at the direction of President Biden’s executive order in March that tasked federal government agencies with studying cryptocurrencies and proposing how to best regulate them. The U.S. Treasury warned in three new reports last month that cryptocurrencies pose meaningful risks for consumers, investors, and businesses if not properly regulated. The FSOC has been monitoring cryptocurrencies and distributed ledger technology since 2015.

The FSOC says it will continue to monitor risks posed by crypto.

a6558e60-417d-45aa-b22c-9c2a67579a22,"The Financial Stability Oversight Council has published the expected Report on Digital Asset Financial Stability Risks and Regulation. According to the US Department of Treasury, the Council voted unanimously to approve the report in response to President Biden’s Executive Order 14067, “Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets.”

The Council’s mission is to identify risks to the financial stability of the United States and involves 15 members from various regulatory agencies.

The report reviews stability risks and “regulatory gaps” that may exist in the digital asset marketplace.

During a meeting today, the Council heard a presentation on the report

Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen issued a statement saying the report is a strong foundation for policymakers as they look to limit any risk while “realizing the benefits of innovation:”

“It is an important contribution to the set of reports that Treasury and our interagency partners have produced as part of President Biden’s executive order. The report concludes that crypto-asset activities could pose risks to the stability of the U.S. financial system and emphasizes the importance of appropriate regulation, including enforcement of existing laws. It is vital that government stakeholders collectively work to make progress on these recommendations,” said Secretary Yellen.

A Fact Sheet was distributed that outlined the main points of the report.

Regarding systemic risk, the report states that crypto assets could pose a risk if they were to scale over time without appropriate regulation. The report states that compliance within existing rules will be key to addressing risk mentioning specifically digital assets that may be securities but not adhering to existing securities law.

Three regulatory gaps were mentioned, including:

Spot markets for crypto-assets that are not securities are subject to limited direct federal regulation.

Crypto-asset businesses do not have a consistent or comprehensive regulatory framework and can engage in regulatory arbitrage

A number of crypto-asset trading platforms have proposed offering retail customers direct access to markets by vertically integrating the services provided by intermediaries such as broker-dealers or futures commission merchants. Financial stability and investor protection implications may arise from retail investors’ exposure to these practices.

The recommendations include:

The passage of legislation providing for rulemaking authority for federal financial regulators over the spot market for crypto-assets that are not securities; S

Steps to address regulatory arbitrage including coordination, legislation regarding risks posed by stablecoins, legislation relating to regulators’ authorities to have visibility into, and otherwise supervise, the activities of all of the affiliates and subsidiaries of crypto asset entities, and appropriate service provider regulation; and

Study of potential vertical integration by crypto-asset firms.

SEC Chairman Gary Gensler issued a statement on the report soon after it was made available to the public. Chair Gensler, once again, noted that:

“Of the nearly 10,000 tokens in the crypto market, I believe the vast majority are securities. Offers and sales of these crypto security tokens are covered by the securities laws.”

On the assumption that almost all digital assets are securities, Gensler said crypto intermediaries must register with the SEC, a statement he has made in the past.

Gensler added:

“I look forward to working with Congress to achieve our public policy goals, consistent with maintaining the regulation of crypto security tokens and related intermediaries at the SEC. In doing so, let’s not inadvertently undermine securities laws underlying $100 trillion capital markets.”

Congress has been circulating multiple bills that may become laws to regulating crypto markets but in the interim, the SEC as well as other regulators like the CFTC will continue to pursue issuers and platforms on the basis that most digital assets are securities or commodities.

34cbaa47-2871-4e34-bd55-904d80cae505,"Joe Biden, US President’s administration has issued an advisory for Congress to proceed with the crypto currency regulations. The big move has come amid the increasing need for clear digital assets laws by the industry.

More strict crypto laws ahead?

As per reports, the US Financial Stability Oversight Council, which includes the Treasury department urged the politicians to form an agreement over the laws. This includes regulations on Bitcoin and other crypto assets.

The Biden administration has asked Congress to press the laws as the delays are putting the investors at a huge risk. This report was submitted after the Congress debate proposal that covered the $140 billion stablecoin market. It includes tax rules for crypto brokers.

Meanwhile, reports suggest that Congress is still months away from passing crypto related legislation. However, the Biden administration seems to be worried about the fear of repeating the same collapse as Terra’s stablecoin USTC.

The historic collapse of Terra’s native token LUNA and stablecoin USTC left a huge dent in the crypto industry. However, it also triggered the downfall of the market. The global digital asset cap has shrunk to stand under the crucial $1 trillion mark.

This incident has increased the volatility in the market. Major digital asset firms also filed for bankruptcy which has caught the eye of the committee.

Who will take the lead?

However, US regulatory agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have come forward to press jurisdiction over the evolving crypto market.

The SEC has gone on to file lawsuits against several crypto firms and currency over illicit practices. However, the SEC chair also argued that most of the digital assets are securities. While platforms should be regulated by the commission.

The report hints that the SEC chair and CFTC chair did not plan to back one agency over another."
be75a696-346d-49c6-bf49-c026644e21cb,"‘Great franchise’: Jim Cramer and other Wall Street experts say the panic over Credit Suisse is highly overblown — why now might be an opportune time to jump in

Credit Suisse (CS) has been making headlines this week, and not for a good reason.

When the bank’s credit default swaps hit a record high, it sparked rumors that it could result in another Lehman Brothers moment. Credit default swaps are derivative products that serve as a form of insurance against a company defaulting on its debt.

Unsurprisingly, the company’s shares tumbled. But Jim Cramer is more optimistic.

“People keep talking about a Lehman moment,” he said earlier this week on CNBC. “I keep thinking, you’re finally going to be able to get a bank merger. And whoever gets Credit Suisse is going to do quite well if you cordon off those losses because boy, that is some great franchise.”

Don't miss

The stock did make a comeback on Tuesday but is still down more than 50% year to date.

So what does the future hold for Credit Suisse? Let’s see what other relatively bullish analysts on Wall Street are saying.

This is not 2008

Although Credit Suisse seems to have lost a lot of confidence from investors this year, Citi Research does not believe it’s going to be like the last financial crisis — which led to the Great Recession.

“We would be wary of drawing parallels with banks in 2008 or Deutsche Bank in 2016,” Citi Research says in a report.

The report points out that Credit Suisse has a tier 1 capital ratio of 13.5%, which is “high vs peers.”

The tier 1 capital ratio compares a bank’s core equity capital to its total risk-weighted assets. Citi Research says that a ratio of 13.5% allows Credit Suisse to have CHF2.5 billion of excess capital compared to a 12.5% ratio.

“The liquidity credit ratio at 191% is among best in class, with a Swiss Franc 235 billion high-quality liquid assets portfolio, so the liquidity position is very healthy,” the report continues.

Story continues

“Rather than liquidity concerns, we see the current move in spreads as an inconvenience for funding costs.”

In other words, the challenge right now is that the bank could face higher financing costs.

‘Still a lot of value’

The widening spreads on Credit Suisse’s credit default swaps was likely the result of credit rating agencies having a negative outlook on the bank, according to DBRS Morningstar equity analyst Johann Scholtz.

Right now, Moody’s, S&P, and Fitch all have a negative outlook on Credit Suisse.

That said, Scholtz does not see a “Lehman moment” coming for the bank, and considers it a “very well capitalized bank.”

“Whilst there is a potential for new write-downs being announced by Credit Suisse at the end of the month when they’re coming up with results, there is nothing publicly available at the moment that indicates that those write-downs will be sufficient to actually cause solvency issues for Credit Suisse,” he tells CNBC on Tuesday.

The analyst adds that there is “still a lot of value” in the bank.

Mark this date

While market participants continue to speculate how things are going to unfold for Credit Suisse, the bank is not standing still.

Last week, Credit Suisse said that it is “well on track with its comprehensive strategic review including potential divestitures and asset sales.”

The company will provide an update about this strategic review on Oct. 27, which is also the date that it reports its third quarter financial results.

Credit Suisse CEO Ulrich Koerner reassured his staff about the bank’s capital base and liquidity position.

“I know it’s not easy to remain focused amid the many stories you read in the media — in particular, given the many factually inaccurate statements being made,” he said in a staff memo obtained by CNBC.

“That said, I trust that you are not confusing our day-to-day stock price performance with the strong capital base and liquidity position of the bank.”

Tweet and re-tweet

ABC business journalist David Taylor’s Saturday evening tweet, which was deleted on Monday, kicked off a round of rumours and unverified claims that European investment banks Credit Suisse or Deutsche Bank could be set to collapse.

ABC business journalist David Taylor.

Adding to the confusion is the tweet, from Taylor’s personal Twitter account, was paraphrased erroneously by Investing.com as being a report from “ABC Australia”, while other tweeters identified the bank in question as Credit Suisse. The Investing.com tweet remained live as of Tuesday afternoon.

The Australian Financial Review has been told that Credit Suisse will not take further action in response to Taylor’s tweet, with the bank focusing on reassuring the markets that it is racing through a restructuring plan. Taylor, Investing.com and Credit Suisse declined to comment.

An ABC spokesman on Tuesday pointed to an earlier statement about the matter.

That statement noted that the tweet was made after Taylor had an exchange with a financial analyst and that the journalist had been subsequently reminded of the broadcasters social media policy.

Venture capitalist Martin Rogers.

One source, who did not want to comment on the record, defended Taylor’s tweet as reflective of multiple negative market rumours that were already swirling around the investment bank.

This source, like the ABC spokesman, felt the matter was finalised since the original tweet had been deleted.

‘What’s the recourse, if any, for Credit Suisse?’

The view that the tweet was ill-judged was shared by venture capitalist Martin Rogers and Kyla Scanlon, a US-based business writer and social media business explainer.

Speaking generally, Mr Rogers, the chief investment officer at Cosmos Ventures Innovation Fund, said “I just think the automation and decline of journalism means that people aren’t fact-checking sources.”

“So in this case, what happens when Investing.com gets it wrong? Investing.com even though [the tweet] was [sent from] a personal account, they attributed it to the employer. What’s the fallback? What’s the recourse for Credit Suisse?”

“Twitter is the new version of the old-fashioned market rumour. I think Credit Suisse is a good bank with a very good street brand name, and they’ve had a few blowouts and they’re going to have some balance sheet repair and it will be painful.”

Ms Scanlon, who writes and creates social media videos about financial topics, said part of the problem was the sheer complexity of the financial markets.

Kyla Scanlon comments and explains business and financial topics.

The creator, who has 143,000 followers on Twitter and 150,000 followers on TikTok, has also teamed up with Bloomberg Opinion to produce a series of videos about “complex ideas on economics and markets” using straight-forward language.

“The root of the problem is the opaqueness of financial markets – it’s incredibly confusing to explain *why* Credit Suisse is not going to implode (banking industry had changed, CDS spreads not at crisis levels) and it’s much easier to lie,” she said in an emailed statement.

“Human brains love danger, clickbait etc.“

Shares in the Swiss banking giant plummeted 12 per cent to an all-time low on Monday after a weekend of fevered Twitter speculation about its financial health, before they regained almost all the losses later in the day.

The wild gyrations show the difficulty for Credit Suisse in managing the febrile confidence of investors as it rushes to devise a repair plan for its investment bank, which has been on the ropes since suffering enormous losses last year from backing Archegos Capital Management. The price investors have to pay to insure the bank’s debt hit record levels, leading some to harken back to the fear-driven days of 2008.

In reality, several analysts say the better comparison is to Deutsche Bank in 2016 and 2017 - a time when Joshi helped devise its own crisis response to a surge in the German bank’s credit-default swaps. Morgan Stanley went through similar in 2011. Both survived the ordeal."

This prompted the bank's chief executive officer Ulrich Koerner to put out a memo playing down speculation surrounding Credit Suisse’s overhaul plans.

2e7b6984-70d3-4626-bba7-efa0a5706a20,"Unsubstantiated social media speculation about the bank’s solidity at the weekend triggered a slump in its bonds while the cost of insuring against a Credit Suisse default jumped on Monday to a level not seen in decades.

“It’s always going to be a challenging restructuring,” said Johann Scholtz, equity analyst at Morningstar. “But what makes it even harder now is that you increased funding costs dramatically and profitability, which was already under pressure, is now even further under pressure.”

Under CEO Ulrich Koerner, in the job since July, Credit Suisse is trying to restore the bank’s profitability and reputation. It lost $US5 billion ($7.7 billion) when Archegos collapsed in 2021, was rebuked by regulators for spying on executives and was tarnished by its involvement with defunct financier Greensill Capital.

To underpin sustainable profit, Credit Suisse is aiming to streamline the investment bank and expand its wealth management business, which soaks up less capital. Amid the options the bank has said it is considering is finding a buyer for its securitised products business.

The more it can fetch for its assets, the less it will have to raise from investors.

A source familiar with the situation said on Friday the bank was exploring all options to get additional capital and that it did not necessarily have to sell more shares. There was a way for it to do so with just asset sales, the source said.

Credit Suisse will still have an investment bank, but it is likely the division would be trimmed, the source added.

The bank has said it will present its plan on October 27, but upheaval in the bank’s stocks and bonds could complicate that task considerably.

“The executives really need to jump on this to inform investors and the general public very specifically about what they’re going to do about a restructuring,” said Mayra Rodríguez Valladares, a financial risk consultant who trains bankers and regulators.

Credit Suisse’s shares have fallen some 60 per cent this year. The cost to insure its bonds also soared again on Monday, adding 105 basis points from Friday’s close to trade at 355 basis points, their highest level in at least two decades.

Adding to its woes is broader market malaise, with rapidly rising interest rates and recession fears as well as the fallout of the war in Ukraine rattling investors and tightening financial conditions.

“The issue Credit Suisse runs into is that it almost becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, not so much from a liquidity perspective, but their star talents start to leave, or the rich people start pulling their money out of the private bank and then the business fundamentals begin to decline,” said James Finch, clinical associate professor of finance at New York University Stern School of Business.

Jefferies analysts wrote in a note that Credit Suisse would be a “forced seller”, which could hurt the price it fetches for assets.

“Selling assets will generate capital but reduce future earnings generation capacity,” the analysts wrote. “Overall, we think asset sales alone are unlikely to be the solution to the potential capital shortfall problem.”

There are also concerns of possible further outflows from the private banking business, analysts at Citigroup wrote in a note to clients on Monday.

Regulators have been watching. A source familiar with the matter said Swiss regulator FINMA and the Bank of England in London, where the lender has a major hub, were monitoring the situation and working closely together.

Executives have reassured staff that the bank has solid capital and liquidity.

Three sources at rival Wall Street firms affirmed that view and pushed back against any comparisons with the industry during the 2008 financial crisis, when banks such as Lehman Brothers failed.

In his note, Mr Beaumont pointed to various measures of Credit Suisse’s capital levels, saying it seemed to be “sufficient to absorb upcoming losses from divestments/asset sales”.

It would behoove the bank to explain that it has sufficient capital to handle any unexpected losses, as well as adequate liquidity and cash to pay its obligations, said Rodriguez Valladares.

“What makes me a bit nervous is that some investors are jumping too quickly,” he said. “Look, the capital levels and the liquidity levels of Credit Suisse are still healthy.”

(Reuters) - Credit Suisse is in the throes of one of the biggest challenges in its history, hurt by a slump in stock price and the worsening of a key gauge of its credit risk ahead of a planned revamp.

The bank is battling market skepticism about its financial health after a string of scandals, months after it was found guilty by Switzerland's Federal Criminal Court of failing to prevent money laundering in the country's first criminal trial of one of its major banks.

Here are the main crises the bank has faced in recent years:

CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP SPIKE

Already wobbling under pressure from a declining stock price, the bank in October saw its credit default swaps - which measure the cost of insuring a firm's bond against the risk of default - surge to the highest level in two decades.

That has made investors jittery about the Swiss financial giant's liquidity and capital, and prompted Chief Executive Officer Ulrich Koerner to reassure shareholders.

Later this month, the bank is set to release its blueprint for a structural overhaul, which is expected to shed more light on its plans to scale back the investment bank into a ""capital-light, advisory-led"" business and strategic options for the Securitized Products unit.

Swiss regulator FINMA and the Bank of England in London, where the lender has a major hub, were monitoring the situation and working closely together, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters.

COCAINE-RELATED MONEY LAUNDERING

In June, the bank was convicted of failing to prevent money laundering by a Bulgarian cocaine trafficking gang.

The court found deficiencies within Credit Suisse regarding both its management of client relations with the criminal organisation and its monitoring of the implementation of anti-money laundering rules.

Both Credit Suisse and the convicted former employee had denied wrongdoing. Credit Suisse said it would appeal the conviction.

BERMUDA TRIAL

A Bermuda court ruled in March that former Georgian Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili and his family are due damages of more than half a billion dollars from Credit Suisse's local life insurance arm.

Story continues

The court said Ivanishvili and his family were due the damages as a result of a long-running fraud committed by a former Credit Suisse adviser, Pascale Lescaudron.

Lescaudron was convicted by a Swiss court in 2018 of having forged the signatures of former clients, including Ivanishvili, over an eight-year period.

Credit Suisse expects the case, which it is appealing, to cost it around $600 million.

'SUISSE SECRETS'

Credit Suisse denied allegations of wrongdoing after dozens of media outlets in February published results of coordinated, Panama Papers-style investigations into a leak of data on thousands of customer accounts in previous decades.

The allegations in the ""Suisse Secrets"" media articles included that the bank had human rights abusers and businessmen under sanctions among its clients.

CHAIRMAN EXIT

Chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio resigned in January after flouting COVID-19 quarantine rules.

The abrupt move came less than a year after Horta-Osorio was brought in to clean up the bank's corporate culture marred by its involvement with collapsed investment firm Archegos and insolvent supply-chain finance firm Greensill Capital.

Board member Axel Lehmann took over as chairman.

TUNA BOND FRAUD

Credit Suisse pleaded guilty to defrauding investors over an $850 million loan to Mozambique meant to pay for a tuna fishing fleet and is paying U.S. and British regulators $475 million to settle the case under a deal announced in October.

About $200 million of the loan went in kickbacks to Credit Suisse bankers and Mozambican government officials. The bank was aware of a huge shortfall between the funds raised and the value of boats bought but failed to disclose this to investors when the loan was restructured in 2016, the regulators said.

Credit Suisse also arranged a loan that was kept secret from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). When Mozambique admitted to $1.4 billion in undisclosed loans the IMF pulled its support, sending the southern African country's economy into a tailspin.

ARCHEGOS DEFAULT

Credit Suisse lost $5.5 billion when U.S. family office Archegos Capital Management defaulted in March 2021.

The hedge fund's highly leveraged bets on certain technology stocks backfired and the value of its portfolio with Credit Suisse plummeted.

An independent report into the incident criticised the bank's conduct, saying its losses were the result of a fundamental failure of management and control at its investment bank, and its prime brokerage division in particular.

The report said the bank was focused on maximising short-term profits and failed to rein in voracious risk-taking by Archegos, despite numerous warning signals, calling into question the competence of its risk personnel.

GREENSILL FUNDS COLLAPSE

Credit Suisse was forced to freeze $10 billion of supply chain finance funds in March 2021 when British financier Greensill Capital collapsed after losing insurance cover for debt issued against its loans to companies.

The Swiss bank had sold billions of dollars of Greensill's debt to investors, assuring them in marketing material that the high-yield notes were low risk because the underlying credit exposure was fully insured.

A number of investors have sued the Swiss bank over the Greensill-linked funds. The bank has returned about $6.8 billion to investors so far.

SHAREHOLDER ANGER

Credit Suisse shareholders rejected a proposal from the bank's board to discharge management from other liabilities for 2020, highlighting shareholder anger of the bank's costly missteps.

The vote garnered only 35.88% approval at the bank's AGM in April, as proxy advisers pointed to risk and control deficiencies leading up to the Greensill and Archegos meltdowns.

That leaves room for shareholders to hold directors responsible for wilful or grossly negligent violations of their duties under Swiss rules.

SPYING SCANDAL

Credit Suisse Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam was forced to quit in March 2020 after an investigation found the bank hired private detectives to spy on its former head of wealth management Iqbal Kahn after he left for arch rival UBS.

Credit Suisse repeatedly played down the episode as an isolated incident.

However, Switzerland's financial regulator said Credit Suisse had misled it about the scale of the spying. The regulator said the bank planned seven different spying operations between 2016 and 2019 and carried out most of them.

In a rare rebuke, the regulator said there were serious organisational shortcomings at Credit Suisse and that the bank had even tried to cover its tracks by doctoring an invoice for surveillance.

In response, Credit Suisse said it condemned the spying and had taken ""decisive"" steps to improve its governance and strengthen compliance.

Credit Suisse CS-N saw its shares slide by as much as 11.5 per cent and its bonds hit record lows on Monday as concerns grew about the bank’s ability to revamp its business and bolster its capital after a string of losses precipitated a strategy reboot.

The bank, one of the largest in Europe and one of Switzerland’s global systemically important banks, has been hit with a string of troubles. It has had to raise capital, halt share buybacks, cut its dividend and revamp management after losing more than US$5-billion from the Archegos collapse in March, 2021, when it also had to suspend client funds linked to failed financier Greensill.

The bank has been working on a restructuring plan it is scheduled to unveil with third-quarter earnings on Oct. 27.

“The key issue is the viability of the bank following its upcoming strategic review,” wrote ABN AMRO analyst Joost Beaumont, who added that adverse market conditions have raised the “execution risk of any strategic review.”

While Credit Suisse’s recent problems were well known and there had been no major recent developments, Swiss regulator FINMA and the Bank of England in London, where the lender has a major hub, were monitoring the situation and working closely together, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters.

The Bank of England, FINMA and the Swiss finance ministry declined to comment.

Chief Executive Ulrich Koerner last week told staff that Credit Suisse, whose market capitalization dropped to a record low of 9.73-billion Swiss francs ($13.4-billion) on Monday, has solid capital and liquidity.

Still, bank executives spent the weekend reassuring large clients, counterparties and investors about its liquidity and capital, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.

A Credit Suisse spokesman declined to comment on the FT report. The weekend calls followed a sharp rise in spreads on the bank’s credit default swaps (CDS), which offer protection against a company defaulting on its debt, the FT said.

Credit Suisse CDS soared again on Monday, adding 105 basis points from Friday’s close to trade at 355 bps, their highest level in at least more than two decades. The bank’s CDS stood at 57 bps at the start of the year.

Still, broadly investors were not panicking about wider risk.

“It’s immaterial to the general systemic risk, and they’ll be recapitalized by the public markets if the environment is good in a month or two, or they’ll be backstopped by the Swiss government if the environment is bad,” said Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member of New York-based Great Hill Capital.

Meanwhile the lender’s international bonds also showed the strain. Credit Suisse’s euro-denominated bonds dropped to record lows, with longer-dated bonds suffering the sharpest declines, though clawed back some losses in the afternoon.

The shares, down by more than half this year, came off early lows and were down 0.4 per cent at 3.96 Swiss francs at 1500 GMT.

In July, Credit Suisse announced its second strategy review in a year and replaced its CEO, bringing in restructuring expert Koerner to scale back investment banking and cut more than US$1-billion in costs.

The bank is considering measures to scale back its investment bank into a “capital-light, advisory-led” business, and is evaluating strategic options for the Securitized Products business, Credit Suisse has said.

Citing people familiar with the situation, Reuters reported last month that Credit Suisse was sounding out investors for fresh cash as it attempts its overhaul.

JPMorgan analysts in a research note on Monday said that based on its financials at the end of the second quarter, they view Credit Suisse’s capital and liquidity as “healthy.”

Given that the bank has indicated a near-term intention to keep its CET1 capital ratio at 13-14 per cent, the second-quarter end ratio is well within that range and the liquidity coverage ratio is well above requirements, the analysts added.

Credit Suisse had total assets of 727-billion Swiss francs ($997.8-billion) at the end of the second quarter, of which 159-billion francs was cash and due from banks, while 101-billion francs was trading assets, it noted.

Still, investors are questioning how much capital the bank may need to raise to fund the cost of a restructuring, analysts at Jefferies wrote in a note to clients on Monday. Also, the bank is now potentially a forced seller of assets, they said.

Deutsche Bank analysts in August estimated a capital shortfall of at least four billion francs.

Over the past three quarters alone, Credit Suisse’s losses have added up to nearly four billion Swiss francs. Given the uncertainties, the bank’s financing costs have surged."
3143ad60-b1b9-4ba1-a3e8-69f44f5eb377,"Private capital strategies are set to double assets under management over the next five years, according to data provider Preqin, even as the fast-growing industry adjusts to a new macro environment.

Private capital markets, encompassing private equity and private capital, have been booming over the past decade as investors chased yield during an era of fiscal stimulus and ample liquidity. Despite this year’s market routs and challenging outlook, with borrowing costs surging and economies cooling, demand for private capital “continues to show resilience”, Preqin said in a report on Wednesday.

It expects the industry’s global assets under management to almost double to $US18.3 trillion ($28.2 trillion) by the end of 2027 from $US9.3 trillion at the end of 2021. The forecast envisages the compound annual growth rate slowing to 11.9 per cent per year in 2021-2027 from 14.9 per cent in 2015-2021.

Demand remains strong as investors continue to seek alternative sources of returns in an uncertain economic environment, according to Preqin.

“We expect to see more sustained growth in the asset classes which have historically performed well in more volatile markets, and which are able to provide inflation protection, such as infrastructure, natural resources, and private debt,” Preqin chief executive Christoph Knaack said.

Preqin expects a 21.5 per cent decline in global private equity fundraising in 2022 after a stellar $US561 billion performance in 2021. Private debt is also expected to grow at a slower pace, but reach an all-time high of $US2.3 trillion in assets under management at the end of 2027."

6789c19c-6939-4e65-9f52-e631e46394c2,"Global private debt fundraising has slowed down slightly this year, tailing off from last year's record-setting pace.



In the first six months of 2022, 66 private debt funds raised a total of $82 billion—compared with the roughly $93 billion collected across 130 vehicles in the same period a year ago, according to PitchBook's H1 2022 Global Private Debt Report.



Direct lending, the largest private debt category, represented over a third of capital raised in the first six months of this year. Other strategies—in particular credit special-situations and real-estate debt—also received strong investor interest during that period.





Private-credit managers raising new capital have had to contend with challenges arising from monetary policy tightening and the brutal stock sell-off. While the interest-rate hikes have made existing floating-rate debt instruments more appealing to investors, they also offer incentives to investors to raise their allocation to more liquid credit investments such as corporate and government bonds. This will be even more prevalent as rates continue to go up.



The so-called ""denominator effect"" due to the sharp slide in the equity market in the first half of 2022 is another factor that dampened fundraising. Some limited partners held back on making new commitments to private-market funds as the decline in public-market valuations left them overallocated to alternative assets.



That said, investor enthusiasm for private debt funds will likely pick up in H2 2022 and early 2023, fueled by the asset class' higher-than-expected returns and the growing size of the private equity market, the research note said.



PE firms will continue to offer direct lenders growing opportunities to deploy capital. That trend will accelerate as securing funding in high-yield bond and leveraged loan markets becomes harder, the note said.



Sponsors are increasingly turning to private credit and direct lenders to fund deals, and credit managers are also offering larger loans to finance big-ticket leverage buyouts.



There have been quite a few unitranche financings of over a billion dollars provided by private debt managers this year to support buyout deals—often in the form of a club deal split among several large direct lenders, the note said. For instance, Hellman & Friedman's acquisition of Information Resources included a $4.5 billion unitranche facility arranged by lenders including Blackstone, Ares Management, Blue Owl and Oak Hill Advisors.



Increasing deal size has led to growth in fund size in general, according to Dylan Cox, PitchBook's head of private markets research. A good number of private-debt funds have closed at over $1 billion in the first half of this year. As of June 30, the combined funding amount these vehicles raised—at least $70.5 billion—accounted for 85.9% of total capital raised by private credit funds, according to PitchBook data.

Private debt providers have been able to step in to provide capital in a challenging economic environment, as institutional investors ponder the cash requirements of businesses they support in the face of inflation and the prospects of an economic slowdown in 2023.

“There is an extreme focus on cash and cash runway — cash becomes king,” said Nishi Somaiya, global co-head of growth equity at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, +1.30% . “We’re very focused on the ability to weather a more challenging environment. Growth rates will be lower, so cost bases have to be adjusted. Scenario planning is something we’re focused on.”

Initial public offerings have evaporated in 2022 in the face of volatility and steep losses in public equities amid jitters around recession and inflation.

Even with strong gains to kick off the first days of October, the Nasdaq COMP, +4.41% has lost about 29% of its value and the S&P 500 SPX, +3.09% is off by about 21%.

Leveraged loan issuance fell 19% in the first half of 2022 to $612.5 billion from $755.5 billion in the year-ago period, according to a White & Case report that cited data from Debtwire Par.

Against this backdrop, companies that had been planning to go public in the next 12 to 18 months are turning to private markets.

One additional challenge is a disconnect in private market valuations, which have yet to catch up to the more rapid downdraft in public equity prices, Somaiya said.

These companies have turned to private debt providers in some cases, while larger companies may also win financing through private structured lending products.

One bright spot for Goldman Sachs is the group of companies that raised ample capital in 2020 or 2021 and have healthy balance sheets as a result.

“Many companies overcapitalized themselves over the past two years because there was so much capital available and many don’t need to raise [fresh capital] yet,” Somaiya said. “In six to 12 months, more companies — as their cash runway starts to shorten — will come back. For us, that’s an exciting opportunity.”

Despite the stark changes in financial markets over the past year, Goldman still sees many of the same long-term investing opportunities such as the rise in global online commerce, increasing pressure on labor costs and rising consumer expectations.

Kevin Sterling, global co-head of private credit, said rising interest rates have caused lending costs to go up for companies, which has caused “ripple effects” on deal-making.

The cost of borrowing was “very clear and very easy” up until late 2021, but nowadays “the certainty of capital is more more complicated” with more opportunities for private credit, Sterling said.

The influx of capital into private debt markets in recent years is a benefit to the overall financial system, rather than a risk, because it improves overall diversity of capital, Sterling said.

“Private credit, for the most part, is long term capital,” Sterling said. “That has some real value, especially in times of dislocation.”

Michael Brandmeyer, global co-head and co-chief investment officer of Goldman’s Alternative Investments and Manager Selection (AIMS) unit, said private market investors are now facing their first major test in about 15 years.

The model of active management of private market positions will reveal winners and losers among private equity firms, he said.

The comments from Brandmeyer, Sterling and Somaiya came Tuesday during a media roundtable on the future of private markets hosted by Goldman Sachs.

Goldman Sachs’s firm-wide assets under supervision across public and private markets are currently about $2.5 trillion. The alternative investments within Goldman Sachs Asset Management are $445 billion, as of June 30.

Goldman’s activities in alternatives include a large buyout fund, a large secondary private equity fund business, growth equity investments, as well as private debt and its Petershill unit, which invests in minority stakes in private equity firms.

Single Australians need at least $545,000 while couples need at least $640,000 in savings according to the Association of Super Funds Australia (ASFA).

ASFA states a 'comfortable' retirement means being able to afford private health insurance, TV and streaming services, a reliable car, home repairs, regular trips to restaurants and the cinema and professional haircuts.

The data found that retirees with at least $545,000 in savings can enjoy one domestic trip per year and one overseas trip every seven years.

Comparatively, retirees who can only afford a 'modest' retirement with $70,000 in savings can expect one domestic trip each year and a 'few short breaks'.

A 'modest' retirement means 'infrequent' trips to the cinema and takeaway meals, a limited budget for home repairs and a cheaper and older car.

For retirees on the government's Aged Pension, short breaks are reduced to a day trip in their own city with only 'local club special meals' and inexpensive takeaway in their reduced budget.

The ASFA data is based on assumptions retirees own their homes outright and are relatively healthy.

Perth-based Investor Natasha Etschmannn said it was 'pretty terrifying' single Aussies needed $545,000 to retire comfortably.

The accounts manager, who regularly posts videos sharing tips on saving and investing money, took to TikTok to share ASFA's expenses breakdown.

'This is a pretty terrifying number for a single if your partner passes away and you don't own your own home as well,' she said.

The figures come as a growing number of Aussies become increasingly anxious they will not have enough superannuation to retire on.

New research has revealed workers typically believe they will be $200,000 short, with data from AMP finding 70 per cent of women were worried about insufficient retirement savings compared with 56 per cent of men.

The AMP report showed women aged 50 to 59 were particularly worried about higher costs of living.

AMP found Australians typically believed they needed $600,000 to retire on but only expected to have $400,000 saved up (stock image)

Surging inflation and cost-of-living pressures are heightening retirement anxieties, leading to fears Aussies are 'unnecessarily compromising quality of life'.

AMP found Australians typically believed they needed $600,000 to retire on but only expected to have $400,000 saved up.

The latest Australian Taxation Office data shows people aged 65 to 69 had an average superannuation balance of $383,367.

That represents an average shortfall of $151,633 for Aussies at or approaching retirement age, based on the recommended superannuation balance.

Bestselling author Scott Pape, known as the Barefoot Investor, is a critic of superannuation industry retirement targets.

A growing number of Aussies are becoming increasingly anxious about not having enough superannuation to retire on - with $545,000 needed to retire 'comfortably' (stock image)

'For far too long the super industry has played to the millionaires in the members' stand,' Pape told his followers last month.

Pape has instead endorsed a recommendation from Super Consumers Australia, which believes $258,000 is enough for an individual who has paid off their home.

The tax office data showed average superannuation balances, across all adult age groups, of $145,388.

Those in the 55 to 59 age bracket had an average balance of $246,771 compared to $108,217 for those aged 40 to 44, and $323,871 for those aged 60 to 64.

7dd3b5f7-329a-422c-895d-9f1290feeff5,"Kim Kardashian has paid US regulators more than $1m to settle charges for failing to disclose that she was paid to promote a crypto asset in a post on her Instagram page.

The reality TV star, social media influencer and entrepreneur, who is estimated to be worth $1.8bn (£1.6bn), has agreed to pay the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) $1.26m to settle the charges.

She was paid $250,000 to post about crypto security tokens sold by EthereumMax on her Instagram account in June last year. Kardashian asked her then 220 million Instagram followers: “Are you guys into crypto????”

The post, which featured the hashtag “#ad”, included a link to the EthereumMax website, which gives users instructions about how to buy the tokens.

Kardashian’s failure to disclose the payment was a violation of federal securities laws, the SEC said.

“This case is a reminder that, when celebrities or influencers endorse investment opportunities, including crypto asset securities, it doesn’t mean that those investment products are right for all investors,” said Gary Gensler, the chair of the SEC.

Kardashian, who now has more than 330 million Instagram followers, has agreed not to promote crypto assets for three years and will cooperate with the SEC’s investigation. However, she has neither admitted to nor denied the regulator’s findings.

A lawyer representing her said: “Kardashian fully cooperated with the SEC from the very beginning and she remains willing to do whatever she can to assist the SEC in this matter.

“She wanted to get this matter behind her to avoid a protracted dispute. The agreement she reached with the SEC allows her to do that so that she can move forward with her many different business pursuits.”

Last year, Charles Randell, then the chair of the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, criticised Kardashian in a speech after she posted the promotion for EthereumMax.

UK regulators have also moved to crack down on the marketing and promotion of cryptocurrencies to members of the general public who for the most part are unaware of the volatility and risks of making such investments.

In December, the UK advertising regulator banned two promotions for “fan tokens” from Arsenal Football Club, saying they misled supporters over the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies.

The Advertising Standards Authority said that the Premier League club took “advantage of consumers’ inexperience or credulity, trivialising investment in crypto assets, misleading consumers over the risk of investment and not making it clear the ‘token’ was a crypto asset”.

The ASA also previously banned a campaign for a cryptocurrency firm for telling the public “it’s time to buy” bitcoin.

In January, the Treasury announced plans to crack down on misleading cryptocurrency ads by making them subject to the same regulations as marketing for other financial products such as shares and insurance.

860f6420-b0a9-4cd5-92d6-7cf5b1a2b98c,"Kim Kardashian Pays SEC $AU1.93 Million Over Crypto Ad on Instagram

Kim Kardashian has agreed to hand over $US1.26 ($AU1.93) million as part of a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over a cryptocurrency ad she posted to Instagram in 2021. Kardashian, who’s worth $US1.8 ($AU2.76) billion, won’t admit wrongdoing but has agreed not to promote any crypto for the next three years, according to an SEC press release.

Kardashian published the promotion to Instagram in June of 2021, and even included a hashtag noting it was an ad.

“ARE YOU INTO CRYPTO??? THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE BUT SHARING WHAT MY FRIENDS JUST TOLD ME ABOUT THE ETHEREUM MAX TOKEN,” the extremely shouty ad on Instagram read.

“A FEW MINUTES AGO ETHEREUM MAX BURNED 400 TRILLION TOKENS- LITERALLY 50% OF THEIR ADMIN WALLET GIVING BACK TO THE ENTIRE E-MAX COMMUNITY,” Kardashian’s ad continued.

The price of the crypto token soared 632% after Kardashian and other celebrities like boxer Floyd Mayweather basketball player Paul Pierce promoted it. But obviously, the coin eventually plummeted, as pump and dump schemes always do, leaving people with a worthless coin.

And while Kardashian noted it was an ad in her Instagram post, that wasn’t enough to appease regulators, who say that Kardashian should have told consumers precisely how much she was getting for the ad.

“The federal securities laws are clear that any celebrity or other individual who promotes a crypto asset security must disclose the nature, source, and amount of compensation they received in exchange for the promotion,” Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement, said in a statement.

“Investors are entitled to know whether the publicity of a security is unbiased, and Ms. Kardashian failed to disclose this information,” Grewal continued.

How much was Kardashian actually paid for the ad? The billionaire received $US250,000 ($AU383,725), all of which she’ll repay with an additional $US10,000 ($AU15,3492) interest. The $US1 ($AU1.53) million on top of that is presumably meant to dissuade Kardashian from doing this ever again after her three-year hiatus."

On Monday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced it had reached a settlement agreement with Kim Kardashian for unlawfully touting crypto asset security ethereummax without disclosing she had been paid $250,000 to promote it. Kardashian agreed to disgorge her promotion fee, and pay a $1 million penalty for violating federal securities laws. She is also barred from promoting any crypto security for three years.

For billionaire Kardashian, one of the world’s leading “influencers”, the penalties are pocket change. However, her public profile means people will notice the SEC’s action. The crypto industry has been a wild west since bitcoin first appeared in 2008, with vast fortunes conjured out of thin air based on little more than herd mentality and hype.

The assets have little to no intrinsic value. Most often, their notional value relies on collective user agreement underwritten by market trading. Critics allege that the “greater fool theory” is what keeps crypto asset markets afloat.

Crypto enthusiasts claim their digital “currencies” will democratise finance by disintermediating banks, brokers and governments from the means of exchange. They laud decentralised finance as an inclusive system, empowering individuals everywhere to bypass these gatekeepers who get rich by ticket-clipping as monetary transfers flow through their pipelines. They assert that the developing world in particular stands to benefit, as billions of unbanked people are excluded from secure repositories to grow their wealth and charged extortionate fees for basic transactions. They point to the array of bank and credit card charges that disproportionately affect the poor in developed countries, hampering their ability to get ahead.

This Robin Hood image makes for good marketing. But it masks a trail of fraud, theft, price manipulation, money laundering, tax evasion, ransoms and corporate collapses that belie the rosy proclamations.

Scammers have stolen billions by hacking accounts or phishing users to access their holdings. Other bandits have spruiked phantom tokens, only to make off with the very real money used to purchase them. Such schemes puncture a key assertion of the crypto industry: that the blockchain technology used to validate ownership guarantees the security of crypto assets and transparency for all transfers.

Blockchains have many potential applications aside from the crypto assets that have

garnered so much attention. A blockchain is a distributed ledger invented by Satoshi Nakamoto,

the unknown pseudonymous creator of bitcoin. It requires multiple participants in a network to

audit and verify transactions and generates a time stamp that provides a permanent record

that cannot be manipulated.

The idea is to eliminate the duplication of digital goods so that clear titles can be allocated to virtual assets. Given the ubiquity of the digital world in every facet of modern life, this could become essential in the same way the internet has.

But when it comes to crypto assets, clearly there are kinks in the process. Aside from the myriad methods to part people from their money, crypto assets consume enormous volumes of electricity.

Each token is “mined” via complex algorithms that require tremendous computing power. This has given rise to giant warehouses that stack computer servers in remote regions, where energy is cheap and scrutiny is minimal. Electricity keeps the servers running around the clock, as well as blasts them with air conditioning to stop them from overheating. Global electricity demand by crypto assets ranges from 120 to 240 billion kilowatt hours a year, equivalent to Australia’s annual consumption.

Perhaps the biggest hole in the crypto assets mythology is the currency illusion. Any currency requires three key features for efficacy. It must be a stable store of value. It must be widely accepted. And it must be readily transferable. Bitcoin, the industry gorilla, fails all three tests. Its price relative to the US dollar, the world’s reserve currency, fluctuates wildly. This makes it more akin to a derivative security than a currency.

Goods and services are rarely denominated in bitcoin, meaning prices must be gauged by reference to an established currency. Meanwhile, transactions average a glacial pace of three a second. This compares with 76,000 transactions per second on the Visa network. As a dependable means of exchange, bitcoin is sadly wanting.

In response to these issues, on March 9 US President Joe Biden issued Executive Order 14067 to ensure the responsible development of digital assets. In short, regulation is coming.

Treasury secretary Janet Yellen, SEC chair Gary Gensler, and Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell have all spoken in favour of bringing order and oversight to the crypto assets industry. They want to squeeze the scammers and mitigate contagion risks to the broader economy should the crypto assets bubble burst.

To this end, Kim Kardashian’s legal settlement provides both a cautionary tale and invaluable publicity that the free-for-all is over. The players are on notice, and new rules are on the way. The referees will be watching."

Have you checked your retirement plan lately? Don't. Big indices like the S&P 500 and the Russell 1000 just hit 52-week lows. And the Dow fell into what experts call a ""bear market,"" which means stocks have fallen 20% from a recent high. This all means that your stocks are probably worth a lot less than they were a year ago.

So how should you be handling your investments at the moment? Bola Sokunbi, founder and CEO of Clever Girl Finance, a personal finance education platform for women, talks to Life Kit about what to do — and how to manage the stress and anxiety around the changing markets.

Here are some takeaways from the conversation:

Life Kit Curious about crypto? What you need to know to get started with digital currencies Curious about crypto? What you need to know to get started with digital currencies Listen · 22:17 22:17

Don't pull your money out! If you have money in a retirement plan or investment account and the markets have dropped significantly, that's actually the worst time to sell your stocks, says Sokunbi. A stock is an asset. Today, it may be valued at less than what you paid for it. But ""unless you actually sell it, you haven't lost anything,"" she says. ""At this time, you want to ride out what's going on in the markets because economies are cyclical."" This Life Kit episode on investing has a helpful explanation on these cycles — and it involves a roller coaster metaphor.

Take a break from logging into your accounts. A lot of emotions can come up when you see your investment accounts plunge in value: fear, anxiety, regret and anger, says Sokunbi — so try not to check your investment accounts more than necessary. ""If you don't need the money anytime soon, then it's OK not to log into your account this week or this month or this quarter,"" she says. Instead, turn your attention elsewhere. Read a good book. Spend time with your friends. Go for a walk (here's a handy Life Kit guide on how to enjoy nature).

If you can, says Sokunbi, always invest at least enough to get the full match. Otherwise, you're turning down free money.

Truss, and her finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng, announced a new “growth plan” on September 23 that would cut taxes and regulation, funded by vast government borrowing to snap the economy out of years of stagnant growth.

But the plan triggered a crisis of confidence in the government, hammering the value of the pound and government bond prices and jolting global markets to such an extent that the Bank of England had to intervene with a £65 billion ($73 billion) program to settle the gilt market.

“It is clear that the abolition of the 45p tax rate has become a distraction from our overriding mission to tackle the challenges facing our country,” Kwarteng said in a statement."

Monday’s move came after more than a week of turmoil in financial markets, which saw the pound plummet to record lows following Chancellor of the Exchequer Kwasi Kwarteng’s so-called mini-budget announcement on September 23.

The package of measures was aimed at boosting growth by cutting taxes and regulation, funded by vast government borrowing, and included a proposal to scrap the top 45 percent rate of income tax paid on earnings above 150,000 pounds ($167,000) a year.

But the plan triggered a crisis of investor confidence in the government, jolting global markets to such an extent that the Bank of England had to intervene with a 65 billion pounds ($73bn) programme to shore up the markets.

Announcing the government’s U-turn, Kwarteng said the proposal to slash the top rate – which made up about 2 billion pounds ($2.2bn) out of the overall 45 billion pounds ($50.4bn) tax-cutting plan – had “become a distraction from our overriding mission to tackle the challenges facing our country”.

“We get it, and we have listened,” he said in a statement released hours before he was due to give a keynote speech at the Conservative Party’s annual conference.

The pound edged up 0.4 percent to $1.120 at 8:25am (07:25 GMT) following Kwarteng’s announcement and yields on UK government bonds fell.

‘Screeching U-turn’

The decision to reverse course is likely to put Truss and Kwarteng under huge political pressure, less than four weeks after they came to power. The UK has had four prime ministers in the last six politically turbulent years.

Truss, a 47-year-old former foreign minister who took office on September 6 after winning a leadership contest among Conservative members, and not the country, said on Sunday that she should have done more to “lay the ground” for the tax cut plan.

Several senior Conservative legislators had come out publicly against the policy, saying cutting government spending and hiking borrowing to fund tax cuts for the richest was politically risky during a pressing cost-of-living crisis.

Al Jazeera’s Paul Brennan, reporting from Birmingham, where the Conservative’s conference is being held, said the “unpopularity” of the tax cut plan had “been reverberating both in the money markets and throughout the UK”.

“It had left the ruling Conservative Party at record low levels [of popularity] in the opinion polls,” Brennan said.

“Clearly, there was a decision made that this could not go on. So we have this screeching U-turn … it is extraordinary, for a government to have stuck to its guns for 10 days, on this deeply controversial issue and then on the day that the chancellor was due to give his keynote speech to the annual conference of the Conservative Party … he lands this.”

An array of investors and economists said the reversal was a step in the right direction but cautioned the government needed to go further still. It is not due to release a fiscal statement with the full scale of government borrowing and debt-cutting plans until November 23."

Kwasi Kwarteng has refused to rule out austerity measures to pay for controversial tax cuts.

Kwarteng and prime minister Liz Truss abandoned their doomed plan to abolish the top rate of income tax for the highest earners.

The government had planned to scrap the 45% rate on earnings over £150,000 in a move to be paid for by increased borrowing.

But in a sensational U-turn, following fierce opposition from the public and politicians, Kwarteng announced on Monday that the plan had been ditched.

However, Kwarteng's budget last month also contained tens of billions of additional tax cuts, including: cancelling the planned increased in corporation tax; reversing the planned 1.25 percentage point rise in National Insurance contributions; bringing forward the 1p cut to the basic rate of income tax to April 2023 - one year earlier than planned; and major changes to stamp duty.

Minutes after the plan was scrapped, Kwarteng refused to rule out a new era of austerity to pay for these additional cuts.

Speaking from the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, where he is due to give a speech later on Monday, he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “You will see what our spending plans are in the medium-term fiscal plan but I’m not going to be drawn into that.”

And in a separate interview with LBC Radio, Kwarteng refused to rule out any more U-turns on his controversial mini-budget, which also scrapped rules which capped bankers' bonuses.

He would only say: ""I'm totally focused on delivering the growth plan.""

In the same interview, amid some confusion, Kwarteng indicated the government does not plan to introduce austerity measures.

""I don't think so at all,"" he said, when asked whether he thought there would be a return to austerity. ""What we're trying to focus on is growing the pie, growing the economy, because without growth we won't get good public services.

""Without growth we won't have higher standards of living. Without growth we won't have enough funding for the NHS. So that's the focus of my chancellorship, that's what the prime minister's focused on and I think if we can grow this economy we can have a much more successful society.""

Something that the chancellor did rule out, however, was more tax cuts, declining to repeat his previous pledge after his mini-budget that there is “more to come”.

He told the BBC: “There will be no tax cuts ahead of a budget.”

When asked if he planned to introduce cuts to public services, Kwarteng insisted the government was sticking to its comprehensive spending review (CSR) from last year, meaning it would not raise spending in line with inflation, which currently stands at just under 10%.

He said: “I think it’s a matter of good practice and really important that we stick within the envelope of the CSR.""

At the weekend, levelling-up secretary Simon Clarke, one of Truss's allies, said the UK must reduce public spending to help fund the government's tax cuts.

In an interview with The Times, he criticised the ""very large welfare state"" and said Britain has been living in a ""fool's paradise"".

As recently as July, a leading economist warned that the UK is facing ""austerity by stealth"" because of soaring inflation.

Jonathan Portes, professor of economics at University College London, said the UK's public services were facing austerity by the back door because inflation meant money promised to schools and hospitals is not stretching as far.

On Monday, Labour MP John McDonnell said he feared ""the Tories are now planning another severe round of austerity to pay for the tax cuts to corporations and increased borrowing costs caused by them"".

Liberal democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said on Monday that Kwarteng should be sacked.

“I welcome this U-turn but the unfortunate truth is that this Conservative government is in complete chaos,"" he told Sky News.

“I don’t think the chancellor has the credibility to make all the changes that are needed and I think he has to go, and I think that would really restore confidence.

“We need a far more radical overhaul of the budget, we need it soon and we need it to be done in a transparent way, and I come to the conclusion, regrettably, that I think this chancellor can’t deliver that.”

She admitted on Sunday that she should have done more to ""lay the ground"" for the policy.

While the removal of the top rate of tax was only expected to cost around two billion pounds out of a 45 billion pound tax-cutting plan, it was the most eye-catching element of a fiscal package that was to be funded by government borrowing.

Kwarteng had not explained how the package would be paid for in the long-term.

Truss had not denied it would require spending cuts for public services and on Sunday refused to commit to increasing welfare benefits in line with inflation - a toxic combination seized on by opposition parties.

""It will take time for markets to buy the message but it should ease the pressure,"" he warned, adding that ""questions still remain and sterling will likely remain under pressure.”

Director-general of The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) Tony Danker has welcomed the chancellor’s decision to U-turn on cutting the 45p tax rate, saying it become a “distraction” from his other economic reforms which he thinks will “make a real difference to growth”.

He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “Here was a package with some really strong economic reforms that businesses have been waiting for for years in fact and clearly, politically the 45p had become a distraction, and probably more importantly businesses up and down the country want the markets to stabilise, that is an absolute pre-condition to investment and growth.

“And it’s a pre-condition to getting on to these very good reforms, so yes I think it’s a good development this morning.

“What’s really been happening economically with this budget is that a set of very strong economic reforms, which are, by the way, controversial enough in this conference, it was absolutely essential to get them passed, but the markets were anxious about the package overall and I think as we see the markets stabilise, which I very much hope they do, that means, we hope, the investment climate stabilises, and we can get on to these economic reforms because I think they’ll make a real difference to growth.”

Jane Foley, head of FX Strategy at Rabobank, said the UK government still has work to do in order to recover its credibility

“Clearly sterling has performed better on the news, but there are still a lot of questions, ultimately the 45 pence tax rate was only a small part of the unfunded tax cuts announced.

""The question remains is this enough? The answer will be clear in a few weeks’ time when the bank of emergency measures end. “UK assets, the pound and gilts are not out of woods yet, and the British government has a lot to do to get back credibility.”

The pound’s volatility “serves as a salutary reminder of the need to deliver credible policy, particularly in the current climate of high inflation and asset price weakness,” Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. strategists Brian Martin and Mahjabeen Zaman wrote in a note. “UK policy setters need to get ahead of market anxiety.”

UK government debt prices rose after chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng announced his tax U-turn, pushing yields lower.

c1286a00-02da-42d6-94d5-bd231d348013,"British finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng has abruptly dropped his plan to eliminate the top 45 per cent rate of income tax, part of his ""mini budget"" that triggered a rout of sterling and government bonds in financial markets.

WHEN WAS IT INTRODUCED?

* The so-called additional rate of income tax of 50 per cent for incomes of more than 150,000 pounds ($A261,331.98) a year was introduced in April 2010 by the government of former prime minister Gordon Brown from the centre-left Labour Party.

* The Conservative-led government of David Cameron cut the rate to 45 per cent from April 2013.

WHO PAYS IT?

* The number of additional-rate taxpayers has grown from about 200,000 in 2010 to about 600,000 today as more earners went above the 150,000-pound threshold which has never been raised.

* The average gain from the planned elimination of the rate for people paying it would have been about 10,000 pounds a year, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Those earning 600,000 pounds a year - the top 0.1 per cent of taxpayers - would have each gained at least 22,000 pounds a year, the think tank said.

HOW MUCH MONEY DOES THE TOP RATE RAISE?

* The top tax rate is not a big earner. The finance ministry said getting rid of it would cost about two billion pounds a year, a fraction of the total 45 billion pounds in tax cuts in the mini-budget. The bigger moves included a reversal of higher social security contributions, a cut in income tax for all workers and abandoning a corporate tax hike.

SO WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

* Kwarteng and Prime Minister Liz Truss wanted the announcement of the cut to underscore their determination to create a low-tax, high-growth economy and make Britain more competitive with other economies.

* Several conservative lawmakers deplored the timing of the move amid a cost-of-living crisis. Many economists said it would do little to boost growth. For many investors, the decision suggested a shift away from sound management of the budget.

IS THE UK A HIGH-TAX ECONOMY?

* Truss lambasted Rishi Sunak, her rival in the race for the leadership of the Conservative Party, for pushing up taxes to their highest proportion of gross domestic product in 70 years while he was finance minister.

* But even if Sunak's plans were introduced, they would have left Britain's tax burden lower than a dozen other European countries including France and Germany, according to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development."

The government had stuck to the policy ever since, even as the value of the pound and government bonds fell, but several senior lawmakers have stepped up their opposition to the policy at the party’s annual conference which began on Sunday.

NEW YORK, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury declined for a second straight day on Tuesday, after a surprise move by Australia's central bank to slow its pace of rate hikes and U.S. data showed job openings fell in August.

The Reserve Bank of Australia raised interest rates by a small-than-anticipated 25 basis points, noting they had already risen substantially but further tightening was also still necessary. Markets had been largely expecting a hike of 50 basis points.

The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was down 3.2 basis points to 3.619%.

Economic data showed job openings in the United States fell to 10.053 million in August, the most in nearly 2-1/2 years, short of the 10.775 million analysts' estimated and a drop from the 11.17 million in July. A cooling of the labor market is one of the ingredients the U.S. Federal Reserve is seeking to help ease inflationary pressures.

""The market is desperately looking for the end of the rate tightening cycle, or to be able to position a point on the horizon to focus on and unfortunately I don’t think the market has it,"" said George Bory chief investment strategist for fixed income at Allspring Global Investments in Connecticut.

""We are looking for that and we will kind of attach some hope to almost anything that will help anchor that position, the reality is the Fed is determined, they want to get inflation down and to do that they need validation from the data.""

The yield on the 30-year bond was down 2.2 basis points at 3.684%.

Investors will see a host of data on the labor market this week, highlighted by Friday's U.S. payrolls report. Signs of softening in the jobs data would likely be welcomed by investors as it could raise expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve may slow its own pace of interest rate hikes.

Recent comments from Fed officials have been in sync as they have vowed to take aggressive measures in hiking interest rates to combat rising inflation even after three straight hikes of 75 basis points.

On Tuesday, San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Mary Daly said the Fed needs to deliver further interest rate hikes and then keep restrictive policies in place until inflation gets back down to the central bank's 2% target.

In addition, Fed Governor Philip Jefferson said inflation was the most serious problem the Fed is facing, and could take some time to address.

A closely watched part of the U.S. Treasury yield curve measuring the gap between yields on two- and 10-year Treasury notes, seen as a reliable indicator of recession when inverted, was at -48.2 basis points, up from -57.85 hit two weeks ago.

The two-year U.S. Treasury yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, was down 0.6 basis points at 4.099%.

The break-even rate on five-year U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) was last at 2.334%, after closing at 2.255% on Monday.

The 10-year TIPS breakeven rate was last at 2.231%, indicating the market sees inflation averaging 2.2% a year for the next decade.

AMP Chief Economist Shane Oliver told Sky News Australia if the central bank continues these larger hikes – which would push the rate past four per cent this year - a recession will follow.

“If we go straight to that level tomorrow and continue rate hikes beyond that, for example the money market has factored in a four per cent plus interest level for Australia,” he said on Monday.

“If we head up to those sorts of levels then I think we will go into recession and the risks of that are rising.”

Mr Oliver said the consensus points to a further ""super-sized"" hike of 50 basis points.

“The consensus is for another 0.5 per cent hike and a 0.5 per cent hike is 80 per cent priced in by the money market.

“So the betting is on a continued super-sized hike tomorrow.”

Australia technically entered into a recession in September 2020 when the economy was effectively shut due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Prior to that Australia had enjoyed more than two decades of economic growth having last entered a recession in the 1990s, which was famously dubbed the one “we had to have” by then treasurer Paul Keating.

A further rate hike would place further pressure on Australians already struggling with skyrocketing cost of living prices. Picture: Getty Images

Another rate hike would place further pressure on Australians already struggling with skyrocketing cost of living prices, with the nation’s inflation rate sitting at 6.8 per cent largely driven by rising fuel prices and the cost of construction.

A 0.5 per cent hike on Tuesday will mean those with a home loan of $500,000 can expect to pay a further $148 per month in repayments.

Those with a loan of $1 million will be required to fork out $296 more each month.

Looking to next year Mr Oliver said he expected the lagging impact of monetary policy to fully come into effect.

“It’s almost certain that Europe is going to go into recession on the back of their energy crisis,” he said.

“In the US it’s a very close call, it is 50-50.

“You’ve got a deteriorating global backdrop but of course as we go through next year, we are going to see the full lagged impact of the rate hikes we have seen so far.

“I think that risk of recession is rising and if the Reserve Bank doesn’t slow down soon that risk will tip to the point where a recession will become probable.”"

The global economic downturn could result in an increase to Australia’s inflation rate, which would entice the RBA to hike rates again.

The OECD is projecting real GDP to grow by 4.1 per cent in 2022, down from its June forecast.

Core inflation in Australia is also projected to hit 5.4 per cent in 2022 before falling to 4.3 per cent in 2023.

That’s a far cry from the RBA’s inflation target of between 2 per cent and 3 per cent.

“The effects of the war and the continuing impacts of COVID-19 outbreaks in some parts of the world have dented growth and put additional upward pressure on prices, above all for energy and food,” the OECD’s economic outlook report said.

The US Federal Reserve aggressively increased the interest rate last month to counter its own inflation problem.

It increased the cash rate by 75 basis points.

The World Bank said in a statement central banks were moving “with a degree of synchronicity not seen over the past five decades”.

“Yet the currently expected trajectory of interest rate increases and other policy actions may not be sufficient to bring global inflation back down to levels seen before the pandemic,” it said.

In recent months, almost all central banks have increased rates, with China, Japan and Russia among the few exceptions.

Three of Australia’s big four banks are predicting a 50 basis point rise to the cash rate on Tuesday.

The outlier, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, is forecasting a 25 basis point increase.

Further increases to the cash rate are likely to only add pain to borrowers.

Entering 2022, the cash rate remained at a record-low 0.1 per cent, implemented during the pandemic.

RBA Governor Philip Lowe had previously insinuated that the cash rate wouldn’t be hiked until 2024.

But, since May, the cash rate has been increased in five consecutive months. Four of those five increases have been 0.5 per cent.

Play Video Kochie rips into RBA over rate rises. Kochie rips into RBA over rate rises. Kochie rips into RBA over rate rises.

The figure behind the increases is inflation, Lowe said.

“Inflation is expected to peak later this year and then decline back towards the 2 per cent to 3 per cent range,” he said in a statement explaining the September decision.

“The expected moderation in inflation reflects the ongoing resolution of global supply-side problems, recent declines in some commodity prices and the impact of rising interest rates.

“Medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored, and it is important that this remains the case. The Bank’s central forecast is for CPI inflation to be around 7.75 per cent over 2022, a little above 4 per cent over 2023 and around 3 per cent over 2024.”

Ultimately, the RBA adjusts its rates to bring inflation into line with its target of between 2 per cent and 3 per cent.

On Thursday, the Australian Bureau of Statistics revealed inflation had risen to 6.8 per cent in the past 12 months.

That figure was largely driven by construction and fuel prices.

Statistician Dr David Gruen AO said a slight fall since the 7.0 per cent reported in August was due to a decrease in petrol prices.

“The largest contributors, in the 12 months to August, were new dwelling construction, up 20.7 per cent and automotive fuel, up 15.0 per cent,” he said.

“The slight fall in the annual inflation rate from July to August was mainly due to a decrease in prices for automotive fuel.

“This saw the annual movement for automotive fuel fall from 43.3 per cent in June to 15.0 per cent in August.”"

One last oversized rate rise is broadly expected before the central bank is tipped to start winding its policy tightening back.

Since May, the Reserve Bank of Australia has hiked interest rates aggressively from record low levels to 2.35 per cent in a bid to tame inflation.

The rate rises have sent mortgage repayments soaring, with RateCity analysis showing a 0.50 percentage point hike would add $760 to the average borrower’s repayments compared to May.

With core inflation at 4.9 per cent – still well above the RBA’s target range of two to three per cent – the RBA shadow board is strongly in favour of another rate hike.

The Australian National University’s shadow board recommended a 50 basis point lift rather than a smaller 25 basis point hike.

The RBA shadow board said the domestic outlook remained upbeat, with the labor market still tight and business confidence generally buoyant.

But there are also challenges looming: Rising interest rates are expected to start weighing on consumer spending; and global conditions are worsening.

“Widespread downturns are likely, with a recession in Europe seen as a near certainty, especially as demand for natural gas going into winter increases,” the shadow board said.

Treasurer Jim Chalmers is also concerned about the global situation.

“In many of the major economies that we monitor most closely, the chances of a recession have edged over from possible to probable,” he told The Australian Financial Review.

“So, we’re not out of the woods by any measure when it comes to cost of living.”

Shadow treasurer Angus Taylor warned the treasurer to keep spending in the upcoming budget constrained despite government finances looking better-than-expected.

“Is he going to blow it? Is he going to spend all that? If he does, he will in the process drive up inflation and raise interest rates,” Mr Taylor said.

Dr Chalmers has committed to delivering a “bread and butter” budget with some targeted cost-of-living relief in areas like medicine and childcare.

Given the backdrop of uncertainty, there’s little agreement on how high rates will rise.

Of the big banks, Westpac is expecting the cash rate to peak at 3.60 per cent in February next year, but the Commonwealth Bank of Australia expects it will top out at 2.85 per cent in November.

NAB economists expect a peak of 3.10 per cent, and ANZ expects a 3.35 per cent high point.

While there are likely more rate rises to come, many expect the RBA to take the foot off the accelerator soon.

After five increases in a row, AMP Capital’s Shane Oliver said the RBA should be “slowing the pace of rate hikes to be able to assess the impact of rate hikes to date and allow for monetary policy lags”.

Meanwhile, the S&P Global purchasing managers index for manufacturing fell slightly from 53.8 to 53.5 in September.

And, according to the Melbourne Institute’s inflation gauge, the annual rate edged up from 4.9 per cent to 5.0 per cent.

'Further policy rate increases are needed in most major advanced economies to ensure that forward-looking measures of real interest rates become positive and inflation pressures are reduced durably,' it said.

'Policy interest rates are projected to rise to 4.5 to 4.75 per cent in the United States, 4.5 per cent in Canada, and 4.25 per cent in the United Kingdom in 2023, reflecting the visible labour market pressures in these countries, and 3.6 per cent in Australia.'

Compared with now, this borrower would owe their bank an extra $456 a month in 2023, as their repayments climbed to $3,422 from $2,966.

As recently as May, this borrower would have owed $2,306 a month paying off a typical loan with a lower variable rate.

Only one of the Big Four banks agrees with the OECD, with Westpac predicting a 3.6 per cent RBA cash rate by February next year.

ANZ is predicting a 3.35 per cent cash rate by December but on Tuesday hinted it is revising that forecast.

'In Australia, we are considering whether additional hikes beyond our peak forecast of 3.35 per cent might be required,' it said.

The Commonwealth Bank, Australia's biggest home lender, has forecast a 2.6 per cent cash rate in November.

NAB is forecasting a 2.85 per cent cash rate by November.

Australia's headline inflation rate in the year to June surged by 6.1 per cent - a level well above the RBA's 2 to 3 per cent target.

It is also predicting a recession in the Euro zone and American economies as annual growth slowed to just a quarter of a per cent compared with half a per cent in the U.S.

Australia's gross domestic product was expected to slow to two per cent in 2023, down from an expected 4.1 per cent for 2022.

The OECD noted inflation in G20 economies, which includes Australia, was already rising caused by Russia invading Ukraine and pushing up crude oil prices.

'Even before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, inflation was above central bank targets in most G20 economies, driven by the initial surge in energy prices as economies reopened after the pandemic, bottlenecks in supply chains, rising freight costs and the shift in the composition of private consumption towards goods,' it said.

Ten of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors advanced in early trading, with the energy sector leading gains. Megacap growth and technology companies such as Apple and Microsoft also advanced 1.5 per cent each.

""We could see a rebound in the beginning of the quarter simply due to the low sentiment and the lows that were reached at the tail-end of the last quarter,"" said Jason Pride, chief investment officer for private wealth at Glenmede in Philadelphia.

All three major indexes ended a volatile third quarter lower on Friday on growing fears that the Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary policy will tip the economy into recession.

""We suspect during the quarter it is going to become more apparent that we are getting closer to a recession as the Fed continues to increase rates and that should probably keep the market closer to, if not below, the lows that it is already at.""

Meanwhile, major automakers are expected to report modest declines in US new vehicle sales, but analysts and investors are concerned that a darkening economic picture, not inventory shortages, will lead to a drop in future car sales.

Tesla Inc fell seven per cent after it sold fewer-than-expected vehicles in the third quarter as deliveries lagged way behind production due to logistic hurdles. Peers Lucid Group fell two per cent and Rivian Automotive 3.9 per cent.

Data showed global factory output mostly weakened in September as slowing demand added to the pain from persistent cost pressures and tighter monetary policy, diminishing economic recovery prospects.

In the United States, manufacturing activity grew at its slowest pace in nearly two and a half years in September as new orders contracted, likely as rising interest rates to tame inflation cooled demand for goods.

Despite stock market gains in the last couple of days, some investors are clearly tired of seeing losses in their retirement accounts this year. New data from Alight Solutions shows last month the vast majority of daily trades in 401(k) plans went from equities to fixed income. ""Almost every time Wall Street has a major dip, we see people taking their money out of stocks and moving it into bonds,"" said Rob Austin, head of research for Alight Solutions, which measures the daily trading activity of more than 2 million 401(k) investors, with about $200 billion in assets. Austin noted the movement was more pronounced in September than in August and July. ""It was not surprising that it coincided at the time that the market fell,"" he said.

Investors are seeking safety

Investors sought safety mostly in stable value funds, with 80% of traded assets put there in September, according to the Alight Solutions 401(k) Index. Money market funds garnered 15% of inflows, while bond funds got about 2% of assets. Meanwhile, 50% of money that was traded came out target date funds, which are designed to invest more conservatively as you get older. And more than a third of outflows came out of large-cap U.S. equity and mid-cap U.S. equity funds.

2e47e43c-7b0a-48ed-96b4-2856244b418f,"Inflation and interest rates are soaring. Stocks are plummeting and bond funds could post their worst year ever. What’s an investor to do?

The standard advice is to not make any drastic changes to your long-term strategy in response to short-term gyrations. Investors who panic sell during a downturn often miss out on market recoveries; others “buy the dip” too soon.

However, “that doesn’t mean never do anything,” said Roger Young, thought leadership director at T. Rowe Price.

Here are some things investors can do now in response to changing conditions that don’t constitute market timing. Be sure to read up on the details or better yet, consult a legal, tax or financial adviser.

Boost your yield: If you still have money sitting in a checking or savings account yielding next to nothing, put that cash to work. Thanks to the Fed’s five rate hikes this year, it’s possible to earn 2% to 4% with little effort or risk.

Many online banks are offering 2% or more in high-yield savings and money market accounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Find such offers at Bankrate.com.

You can also earn upward of 2% on money market mutual funds managed by firms such as Vanguard, Charles Schwab and Fidelity. These are not FDIC insured but are considered low risk; some invest only in U.S. government securities.

If you can tie up your money for a bit, consider buying shorter-term U.S. Treasury securities. On Thursday, annual yields ranged from 2.8% on a one-month bill to roughly 4% and 4.2% on one- and two-year maturities, respectively.

You can buy them from the government by opening an online Treasury Direct account at Treasurydirect.gov and linking it to a bank account. Treasurys are backed by Uncle Sam and their interest is exempt from state and local (but not federal) income tax.

“The one- or two-year Treasury has one of the best risk-reward profiles you will see in the marketplace now,” said Chris Wheaton, senior investment adviser with Litman Gregory Wealth Management in Larkspur.

You can’t buy Treasurys for an IRA through Treasury Direct, but many brokerage firms will let you buy them in an IRA or taxable account. Check to see if there is a commission.

Some brokerage firms are also offering certificates of deposit from FDIC-insured banks (called brokered CDs) with yields rivaling Treasurys. In some cases, yields on brokered CDs are much higher than what the same banks are offering their own customers.

I bonds: Another option is the Treasury’s inflation-linked I bonds. Their interest rate is linked to the consumer price index and changes every six months. On the first business day of May and November each year, the Treasury announces the rate that will apply to I bonds purchased within the next six months.

Bonds purchased before Nov. 1 will earn an annual rate of 9.62% for the next six months. Every six months after your purchase, the rate on your bond will adjust to the then-current rate.

You can purchase I bonds in a Treasury Direct account or in paper form with a federal tax refund. Purchases are limited to $10,000 per person per year (in electronic form) and $5,000 (paper form). Interest is exempt from state and local (but not federal) income tax.

You must hold I bonds for at least one year. If you cash them in before five years you lose three months of interest. You cannot buy them in an IRA.

Tax-loss harvesting: If you have losses on investments in a taxable account, consider selling some to generate a capital loss. Come tax time, you can deduct these “realized” losses from capital gains you realized when you sold investments at a profit or received capital gains distributions from mutual funds.

If your capital losses exceed your capital gains this year, you can deduct up to $3,000 in remaining losses from your ordinary income, such as that from a job or pension. If you still have losses remaining, you can carry them into future years to offset first capital gains and then up to $3,000 in ordinary income, until your losses are exhausted.

This strategy can be especially useful in California, which taxes capital gains the same as ordinary income at rates up to 13.3%.

Caveat: If you sell something at a loss and repurchase the same or a “substantially identical” security within 30 days before or after the sale, you will violate the “wash sale” rule and won’t be able to write off the loss on that year’s tax return.

If you want to generate a loss but don’t want to be out of the market, you could immediately buy a similar, but not substantially identical, investment. For example, you could sell a Standard & Poor’s 500 index fund and buy a total U.S. stock market fund or a Russell 1000 fund and get similar returns. Or you could sell a stock and buy a fund that invests in the same industry.

Most people do this in December, when they have a better picture of their tax situation for the year and have received information about capital gains distributions, but you don’t have to wait until then.

Note: This strategy won’t create a tax benefit in IRAs and 401(k) accounts.

Roth conversions: If you think assets held in a traditional IRA are poised for a rebound, “without changing your overall allocation, you could convert some of your traditional IRA to a Roth,” Young said.

The amount converted will be taxed as ordinary income but from that point forward, you generally won’t pay taxes on the Roth IRA. (Account earnings could be taxable if you withdraw them before meeting certain holding requirements.) By comparison, if you keep the money in a traditional IRA, every dollar you take out will be taxed as ordinary income.

You can also convert money from a traditional pre-tax 401(k) account to a Roth 401(k), if your employer allows.

There is no income limit to do a Roth conversion; nor is there a limit on the amount you can convert at any time.

Drought Map Track water shortages and restrictions across Bay Area Updated to include drought zones while tracking water shortage status of your area, plus reservoir levels and a list of restrictions for the Bay Area’s largest water districts.

Another benefit: When you turn 72, you won’t have to take required minimum distributions from your Roth IRA each year, like you do with a traditional IRA or 401(k). However, those with Roth 401(k) accounts generally do have required distributions once they reach 72, if they haven’t yet rolled those dollars over to a Roth IRA, said Jeffrey Levine, chief planning officer with Buckingham Wealth Partners.

Also, heirs (other than a spouse in some cases ) must take required distributions from inherited Roth accounts, as they would from traditional IRAs and 401(k) plans.

Warnings: The additional income from a conversion could push you into a higher tax bracket, trigger a temporary surcharge on Medicare Parts B and D premiums or impact the taxation of Social Security benefits. And once you convert assets to a Roth account, you can no longer undo or “recharacterize” the conversion.

“Market dips are a good opportunity for Roth conversion,” Wheaton said. “The assets are worth less and if you think there will be a rebound over the next few years it makes sense to convert some.”

Stock compensation: If you exercised stock options or vested in restricted stock units early this year when stock prices were higher, “consider whether you should re-evaluate your strategy,” said Helen Dietz, West Coast managing director with Aspiriant, a wealth management firm.

When restricted stock units vest, the value on the vesting date is added to your ordinary income for the year. The company will withhold a certain amount to cover taxes, but it might not be enough to cover the full amount due. If the stock price has gone down, you might want to sell some shares to raise cash and realize a capital loss. (See tax-loss harvesting above.)

Likewise, if you exercised nonqualified or incentive stock options at the beginning of the year and haven’t sold the underlying stock, “consider if it still makes sense to keep holding that,” Dietz said. There could be regular and alternative minimum tax issues. “There were many articles written about how tech people exercised stock options in 2000 and got stuck with a tax liability they weren’t prepared for.”

Gift and estate planning: Wealthy families whose estates could be subject to estate tax may want to give some undervalued assets to their eventual heirs today, when the federal lifetime gift and estate tax exemption is at a record high, $12.06 million per person. This exemption will drop after 2025 to $5 million plus an inflation factor, which would bring it to about $7 million in 2026, unless Congress changes the law.

“If you have an asset whose value is temporarily low because of market conditions, maybe a business or building impacted by Covid, it’s a good time to consider gifting that asset. It will use less of your federal gift and estate tax exemption,” said Chelsea Suttmann, an estate planning attorney with Barulich Dugoni & Suttmann Law Group in San Mateo.

Also, any person can give, to any number of individuals, up to $16,000 each this year without having it come out of their lifetime gift and estate tax exclusion. If you have stock, for example, that was worth $20,000 but is now worth $16,000, you could get it out of your estate this year without any gift tax consequences.

Intra-family loans: The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate conforming mortgage has more than doubled this year to 6.7% this year. If your kids can’t afford a home at that rate and you have funds available, consider making them an intra-family loan.

“If I want to loan my kids $1 million and want them to pay me back with no gift involved, I would have to charge them interest at a rate equal to or greater than the applicable federal rate,” Suttmann said. The Internal Revenue Service sets this rate every month. For October, it will be 3.43% for loans longer than nine years. That is up from 1.82% in January but well below commercial rates.

Anyone newly retired or nearly so must feel like they have the worst timing in the world. A portfolio tends to be largest near retirement, just before those savings are about to be drawn down. These days, however, most portfolios have lost value; the S&P 500 is down about 20% so far this year.

The financial industry has a name for this scenario: sequence of return risk. “It matters most at retirement when you’re selling assets for income,” says Wade Pfau, a professor of retirement income at The American College of Financial Services in King of Prussia, Pa. “You need to sell a larger number of shares to get the same amount of money. Those shares are then gone so even if the market bounces back, your portfolio won’t recover as much.”

SEE MORE Using Your 401(k) to Delay Getting Social Security and Increase Payments

The newly retired are particularly vulnerable because they’re “relying on this pot of money to finance the next 20 to 30 years of their life,” says Amit Sinha, head of multi-asset design at Voya Investment Management in New York City.

Sequence of return risk is less of a concern for someone further along in retirement because retirees typically shift to safer, more conservative investments and have fewer years to pay for. Plus, these investors may have benefited from portfolios boosted by strong returns early in retirement.

Similarly, if retirement is a decade or more away, what happens to markets today is mostly irrelevant. “You just allow the compounding to work for you and recover over those years,” says Sinha.

Someone retiring now, of course, doesn’t have that luxury. If this describes you, there are several things you can do to minimize the damage, but first, assess what it’s likely to mean for your portfolio long term.

Depending on how you react now, the damage may not be as bad or as lasting as you think.

Just How Bad Is It?

Sinha has run sequence of return risk simulations for every year dating back to 1977, including some of the worst years in recent memory when S&P 500 losses were even steeper than now: the financial crisis that began in 2007 (-51.93%), the dot-com crash (-36.77%) in 2000, and Black Monday in 1987 (-33.51%).

The key message investors should take away from his research? Don’t shift to an all-cash portfolio. He compared what those savings would look like if the investor had started retirement all in cash and stayed that way instead of maintaining a 40/60 portfolio of stocks and bonds. “Even for the worst scenarios of sequence risk, the portfolio with stocks and bonds would outperform staying in cash. In some cases, the first few years were pretty painful, but ultimately the investment portfolios always came out ahead,” Sinha says

For example, someone who retired right as the dot-com bubble burst would have had about 10% to 20% less in savings than the cash portfolio for the first five years of retirement. At that point, the two approaches broke even for a while. Then, at the 10-year mark, the investment portfolio started pulling away and by the 20th year of retirement was worth twice as much as the all-cash portfolio.

SEE MORE How to Keep More Money in Retirement: Tax Diversification

Sinha also calculated how long those savings would last after a sizable loss the first year of retirement, assuming an initial 4% withdrawal rate and a long-term annualized return of 5%.

“If your portfolio lost 25% of its value in year one, it should still safely last 40 years. Even if your portfolio lost 50%, it should last 18 years,” he says, adding that the odds of a one-year 50% drop are low for a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds.

Markets eventually recover, and with them a balanced portfolio will, too. The average bear market lasts 289 days, according to the investing website Seeking Alpha, and some recoveries happen fast.

“The pandemic was a perfect example. Those who cashed out missed the sudden rebound,” says Pfau. In fact, Pfau suggests remembering just how strong returns were in 2021. “Markets did unusually well last year,” he says. “With this year’s drop, average returns are more in line with the annual 5% to 10% we expect, versus the more than 25% gain from last year. When you think of it that way, your portfolio performance might not be that far behind.”

Make Your Own Luck

If cashing out now is the worst thing you can do, what are some smart steps to take instead? Here are several strategies to minimize the damage from sequence of return risk and make your savings last.

Reduce your withdrawal rate. Financial theory predicts that you can withdraw 4% of your initial retirement portfolio and keep taking out that same amount each year without running out of money for 30 years, even after facing an initial loss. Someone who started withdrawing $40,000 a year from a million-dollar portfolio just before the bear market began theoretically could continue doing so now.

But if you want to play it safe, you could reduce how much you withdraw. For example, if your portfolio is now $800,000, you could take out just $32,000 a year, 4% of your remaining balance. Pfau suggests using a variable withdrawal strategy, taking out more in good investment years and less in bad ones. “When the market is down, you could have the attitude that I’ll spend less to take pressure off my portfolio.” Of course, living off of significantly less income might not be possible, but anything you can do to reduce your withdrawals leaves more of your portfolio intact for an eventual rebound.

Tap nonmarket assets. Pfau also suggests looking into your other assets, like borrowing the cash value from a life insurance policy or using a reverse mortgage to tap into your home equity, as alternative sources of income while the market is down. When the market recovers, he says it’s up to you whether you want to pay back those loans, depending on how much you want to leave heirs.

Further diversify your portfolio. Greater investment diversification could speed up how quickly your portfolio recovers. “If your stocks are all U.S. companies, perhaps add some international investments,” Sinha says. “That way you aren’t just relying on one bet—the U.S. economy recovering.”

Consider an annuity. For help offsetting market volatility, you could shift some of your portfolio to an annuity, which turns your payment into future income. Some annuities offer guaranteed payments for life that don’t change based on market returns. “Creating a source of income that isn’t market dependent can help reduce sequence of return risk,” says Dave Kloster, president of investment management at Thrivent in Minneapolis.

Pfau acknowledges that it might be harder to fund an annuity now if your portfolio took a hit. He says this strategy is worth considering if you still have the money to buy an annuity, or you could wait until after the next market rebound.

Invest conservatively at the start. This next strategy won’t help a new retiree now, but it’s something to remember if you plan to retire at some future date after the market has recovered. Because portfolios are most vulnerable to sequence of return risk in the early years of retirement, Pfau suggests investing far more cautiously at this stage: “Instead of the typical 60/40 stock-bond mix, consider starting with 30/70.” He says that you should gradually increase the stock percentage back to 60/40 within the first decade of retirement. “This strategy is meant to avoid the worst-case scenario of a big loss when your portfolio is largest.”

Delay retirement. If you haven’t retired yet and can keep working, you could wait for your portfolio to recover. You would avoid spending down your savings at a low point and could invest some of your earnings now at bargain prices. Review your plan. In stressful times, it’s worth asking a financial expert to assess your retirement plan. “A well-designed plan should be able to handle volatility in the markets,” Kloster says.

SEE MORE What Is the Social Security COLA?

The discussion might leave you feeling more comfortable about the numbers and how your plan should hold up over time. “This won’t be the only period of contraction in our lives,” he says. “You need to feel confident in your strategy to avoid making major changes based on market conditions, like selling low and buying high,” he says. “Find an acceptable level of risk and remember it’s impossible to time the markets.”

So what's the right call? Ask yourself these questions to find out.

1. How is my portfolio set up?

Older investors are often urged to start steering away from stocks as retirement nears and shifting over to assets that tend to be less volatile, like bonds. If you followed that advice, it may be the case that your portfolio is set up to withstand a market downturn like the one we're currently in the midst of.

Let's say stocks only comprise 50% of your portfolio, with the rest of your assets being allocated to bonds and cash. You may be in a position where you're able to leave the stock portion of your portfolio alone until the market recovers.

In fact, you may have enough non-stock assets to keep that half of your portfolio untapped for many years. If that's the case, moving forward with retirement isn't at all unreasonable.

2. What other income sources do I have available?

There's a good chance you'll rely heavily on your investment portfolio once you retire. But you may have enough outside income at your disposal to leave your portfolio untouched entirely until the market regains the value its lost this year.

Let's imagine you earned a decent salary throughout your career, and as such, are entitled to a pretty generous monthly benefit from Social Security. Let's also assume your retirement plans include working in your adult child's bustling cafe twice a week and earning a little extra income there.

All told, you may be in a position where you have enough money to live on that you can leave your portfolio alone for a good number of years without having to stress or pinch pennies. In that scenario, postponing retirement isn't necessarily something you should feel compelled to do.

Don't assume the worst

It's easy to see why the state of the stock market could be tempting you to rethink your retirement plans. But before you resign yourself to the extended career you don't want, think about whether you can make today's circumstances work. You may find that if your portfolio is set up in a savvy, age-appropriate manner, and if you have enough outside income coming your way, you can retire in the very near future without sentencing yourself to years of financial upheaval.

23fbcde6-6404-4b42-8261-4653376820e5,"The pound, gilts and UK stock market have bounced higher after a week of turmoil, as global investors reacted to attempts to steady Britain's economic ship.

Further support for the markets came as investors weighed the possibility of an interest rate pivot from the US Federal Reserve.

The FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 were up 2 and 2.6 per cent, respectively, by late afternoon after weak US manufacturing data on Monday increased chances that the Fed may opt to pause interest rate hikes, in order to prevent the economy from slowing too sharply.

Attempts to indicate greater fiscal discipline and the scrapping of plans to abolish the UK's 45p tax band also helped sterling tick 0.3 per cent higher to $1.14, while gilt yields have fallen across the board.

UK asset staged a rebound on Tuesday as investors welcomed signs of a Fed pivot and the UK Government's u-turn on scrapping the 45p tax rate

Two-year, five-year and 10-year gilt yields were down 22 basis points, 18bps and 15bps today.

However, at 3.71 per cent, 4 per cent and 3.8 per cent, respectively, they remain above levels seen before the Chancellor’s now-infamous mini-budget, despite Bank of England intervention since the event.

Meanwhile 30-year gilt yields, specifically targeted by the Bank of England, are back to pre-mini budget levels at 3.84 per cent.

Speculation of a Fed pivot has not only benefited UK assets, with the euro, and European and Asian stocks performing well on Tuesday.

All major European exchanges are up by more than 2 per cent, pushing the Euro Stoxx 50 2.7 per cent higher, while the Bombay-based BSE Sensex and Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 have added 2.3 and 3 per cent, respectively. The euro has rallied against all major currencies.

Risky assets have taken a hit this year as central banks globally undertake monetary tightening to tame surging inflation, at the risk of causing a recession, and the potential for a Fed pivot has spurred investor optimism.

Head of portfolio management research at MSCI Andy Sparks said: ‘The chances for a pivot are much greater during 2023.

‘The Fed seems poised to hike rates another 1.25 percentage points. So far, the Fed has had the luxury of taking a hawkish position while the labour market has been hot. But the picture may change entering the new year.

‘The easy pivot path for the Fed will be if inflation has fallen significantly. The real challenge will be if inflation has not declined as much as hoped, but the economy has weakened. In such a case, the Fed’s resolve to continue rate hikes will be tested.’

While the FTSE 100 remains roughly 6 per cent down for 2022, this represents outperformance versus global peers which have fallen much further.

The index has benefited from its export-driven and dollar-earning participants, while the more domestically-focused FTSE 250 has fallen by more than 25 per cent this year.

Head of markets at interactive investor Richard Hunter said today’s rally in UK stocks ‘may have been welcome, but it may also be transitory’.

He added: ‘The UK government’s decision to reverse part of its previous tax cutting plan also had a disproportionately positive affect on sentiment generally, with sterling recouping some of its previously precipitous losses following the initial announcement.

‘More volatility is likely to follow as the global economy grapples with high and persistent inflation and the central banks’ attempts to tame it without tipping into recessionary territory.’

The pound remains roughly 16 per cent down against the US dollar since the start of 2022 and experts warn it is unlikely to recover ground in the near-term.

Chief global strategist at Principal Global Investors Seema Shah said that while the pound may have rebounded to pre-‘fiscal event’ levels, this should not be interpreted as markets’ endorsement of ‘Trussenomics’.

She added: ‘It is true that sterling has had a mini-rally but, firstly, this was from historically weak levels to begin with and, secondly, the new value of sterling prices in steep rate rises which have been made necessary by the chaotic market response to the Chancellor's growth plan.

‘To be back where we were - but with a potential mortgage crisis now baked into the cake - is hardly a triumph.

‘Further sterling rises might in fact be telling us that investors believe that the Truss/Kwarteng axis can be brought in line with more orthodox economic thinking by MPs who have not been shy to make their scepticism public and threatened to vote against their own party – quite the opposite of markets “believing” the Government’s vision.

‘It could even indicate investor opinion that the odds of either – or both - the PM and Chancellor leaving their respective posts earlier than planned are rising. What looks on the surface like a cautious vote of confidence in the currency markets could, in fact, be anything but.’"

By Lawrence Delevingne

Sept 30 (Reuters) - Wall Street and global stocks slumped further on Friday, with government bond yields and the dollar holding near recent peaks, as higher-than-expected inflation capped a nasty third quarter for world markets.

Fresh personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index data, tracked by the U.S. Federal Reserve as it considers more interest rate hikes, showed a rise of 0.3% last month after dipping 0.1% in July. Euro zone inflation also hit a record high of 10% in September, surpassing forecasts, flash inflation data showed.

Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard said the U.S. central bank would need to maintain higher interest rates for some time as part of its effort to tame inflation and must guard against lowering rates prematurely.

Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial in Charlottesville, Virginia, said the new price index data ""did little to assuage fears that the campaign to curtail inflation is working as quickly as hoped by the market.""

All three major Wall Street indexes finished down around 1.5% after a day of choppy trading.

It was the third consecutive weekly decline for the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and all three indexes, including the Nasdaq Composite, were down for the second month in a row.

In the first nine months of 2022, Wall Street suffered three straight quarterly declines, the longest losing streak for the S&P and the Nasdaq since the Great Recession and the Dow's longest in seven years.

Friday's losses cap a week of global market turmoil that saw stocks and currency markets, already rocked by recession fears, sapped further by a U.S. dollar at 20-year highs.

Asian shares outside of Japan fell 0.4% on Friday, down around 13% in September, their largest monthly loss since the start of the pandemic in 2020.

Story continues

European shares saw some recovery, with Europe's STOXX 600 up 1.3%, but they notched a third consecutive quarter of losses on worry about the impact on global growth of central banks' hiking interest rates to counter inflation.

The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, fell 0.85% on Friday, down about 9.8% for the month and 7.3% for the quarter.

""We do not expect a sustainable rally in stocks until the Fed sees clear and multiple months of evidence that inflation is trending down,"" Andy Tepper, a managing director at BNY Mellon Wealth Management in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania, said in an email.

European government bond yields fell, while Germany's 10-year yield was virtually flat at 2.118%, compared with Wednesday's peak of 2.352%, an 11-year high.

U.S. Treasury yields gained modestly. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was up 6.9 basis points to 3.817%; the 30-year was up 7.3 basis points to 3.766%, and the two-year, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, was up 7.4 basis points at 4.244%.

Goldman Sachs strategists forecasted that the Fed would deliver rate hikes of 75 basis points in November, 50 basis points in December and 25 basis points in February, for a peak rate of 4.5-4.75%, according to a client note released Friday.

The Bank of England will not raise interest rates before its next scheduled policy announcement on Nov. 3 despite a plummet in sterling, but would make big moves in November and December, a Reuters poll forecast.

European Central Bank policymakers have also voiced more support for a large rate hike.

The British pound, which was driven to all-time lows earlier this week on a combination of dollar strength and the government's plans for tax cuts funded by borrowing, rose about 0.35%, but still suffered its worst quarter versus the dollar since 2008.

The dollar index was flat on the day after hitting a 20-year high on Wednesday. The dollar index has risen about 17% this year. COMMODITIES

Oil prices dipped in choppy trading but notched their first weekly gain in five on Friday, underpinned by the possibility that OPEC+ will agree to cut crude output when it meets on Oct. 5. Brent crude futures fell 0.6% to settle at $87.96 a barrel and U.S. crude tumbled 2.1% to $79.49.

Gold was little changed, wrapping up its worst quarter since March last year, pushed down by fears of ever-higher interest rates.

BOJ kept monetary policy ultra-loose at Sept meeting















TOKYO, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Broadening price rises in Japan prompted some central bank policymakers to warn last month that inflation may overshoot expectations, highlighting the challenge Governor Haruhiko Kuroda faces in justifying ultra-low interest rates.

One board member went as far as saying the Bank of Japan (BOJ) must eventually communicate an exit strategy from ultra-easy policy, a summary of opinions at the September meeting showed.

While many opinions called for the need to keep monetary policy ultra-loose to support the fragile economy, the comments highlight a gradual shift in the balance of the BOJ board once dominated by proponents of aggressive easing.

""There's a risk consumer inflation may deviate significantly upward from our baseline scenario, partly due to the impact of exchange-rate moves. This needs to be examined humbly and without any preconceptions,"" one board member was quoted as saying in the summary, released on Monday.

""Companies continue to announce plans of price hikes against the background of higher raw material costs. Price rises are likely to continue for a wide range of products,"" according to another opinion shown in the summary.

At the Sept. 21-22 meeting, the BOJ maintained ultra-low interest rates and its guidance pledging to keep monetary policy ultra-loose until inflation stably achieves its 2% target. It was the first meeting for two newcomers, who in July replaced a former commercial banker Hitoshi Suzuki and dovish economist Goushi Kataoka.

The BOJ remains an outlier among a global wave of central banks tightening monetary policy to combat soaring inflation, which has pushed the yen to 24-year lows against the dollar.

""A majority of the board seemed to believe that while price rises are broadening, it's unclear yet whether this will lead to sustainable wage gains crucial to achieving the price target,"" said Ayako Fujita, chief Japan economist at JPMorgan Securities.

""But compared with July, there seems to be a change emerging within the board on how they see the price and wage outlook. The key for the BOJ's policy outlook would be whether such views become more widely shared,"" she said.

At the September meeting, one member pointed to concern held among some market participants over distortions in bond market functioning, driven in part by the BOJ's huge bond buying.

""At some point in the future when the timing is appropriate, it's important for the BOJ to properly communicate with markets an exit strategy,"" the member was quoted as saying.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Bank of Japan (BOJ) board members agreed the inflationary impact of the yen's recent sharp moves must be closely scrutinised, but policymakers reiterated their resolve to keep policy loose even as the currency's rapid fall has unsettled financial markets.

In minutes of the BOJ's July policy meeting released on Wednesday, one member said the downward pressure on the yen may ease as the global economic slowdown begins to weigh on inflation and long-term interest rates across the world.

""If the global economy experiences a shock, there's a chance the current weak-yen trend could change into a strong-yen trend,"" another board member was quoted as saying.

At the July 20-21 meeting, the BOJ projected inflation would exceed its 2% target this year in fresh forecasts, but maintained ultra-low interest rates and signalled its resolve to keep monetary super loose.

Analysts blame the BOJ's extremely low rates for accelerating the Japanese currency's declines.

In a surprise move last week, the government intervened in the currency market to stem yen weakness by selling dollars and buying yen for the first time since 1998.

At the July meeting, some BOJ board members said they saw price rises broadening with one seeing a stronger chance Japan can achieve sustained inflation backed by rising wages, the minutes showed.

A few members also said rising inflation expectations were driving down real interest rates and enhancing the stimulus effect of the BOJ's ultra-loose policy.

But the board members agreed on the need to keep ultra-low rates to ensure Japan sustainably achieves their 2% target backed by higher wages.

""It's inappropriate to tweak yield curve control as doing so could weigh on the economy through an increase in long-term interest rates,"" one member was quoted as saying.

The discussions underscore how the BOJ board members see little need to combat sharp yen declines through rate hikes, even as the currency's falls have been exacerbated by divergence of monetary policies between Japan and the aggressive hawkish turn in other developed economies.

Under yield curve control (YCC), the BOJ guides short-term rates at -0.1% and caps the 10-year bond yield around 0% to reflate growth and sustainably achieve its 2% inflation target.

Core consumer inflation quickened to 2.8% in August, hitting its fastest annual pace in nearly eight years and exceeding the central bank's 2% target for a fifth straight month.

But BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has dismissed the chance of a near-term rate hike, noting that recent price rises were driven by global commodity inflation and will prove short-lived.

In minutes of the BOJ's July policy meeting released on Wednesday, one member said the downward pressure on the yen may ease as the global economic slowdown begins to weigh on inflation and long-term interest rates across the world.

""If the global economy experiences a shock, there's a chance the current weak-yen trend could change into a strong-yen trend,"" another board member was quoted as saying.

At the July 20-21 meeting, the BOJ projected inflation would exceed its 2% target this year in fresh forecasts, but maintained ultra-low interest rates and signalled its resolve to keep monetary super loose. read more

Analysts blame the BOJ's extremely low rates for accelerating the Japanese currency's declines.

In a surprise move last week, the government intervened in the currency market to stem yen weakness by selling dollars and buying yen for the first time since 1998. read more

At the July meeting, some BOJ board members said they saw price rises broadening with one seeing a stronger chance Japan can achieve sustained inflation backed by rising wages, the minutes showed.

A few members also said rising inflation expectations were driving down real interest rates and enhancing the stimulus effect of the BOJ's ultra-loose policy.

But the board members agreed on the need to keep ultra-low rates to ensure Japan sustainably achieves their 2% target backed by higher wages.

""It's inappropriate to tweak yield curve control as doing so could weigh on the economy through an increase in long-term interest rates,"" one member was quoted as saying.

The discussions underscore how the BOJ board members see little need to combat sharp yen declines through rate hikes, even as the currency's falls have been exacerbated by divergence of monetary policies between Japan and the aggressive hawkish turn in other developed economies.

Under yield curve control (YCC), the BOJ guides short-term rates at -0.1% and caps the 10-year bond yield around 0% to reflate growth and sustainably achieve its 2% inflation target.

Core consumer inflation quickened to 2.8% in August, hitting its fastest annual pace in nearly eight years and exceeding the central bank's 2% target for a fifth straight month.

But BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has dismissed the chance of a near-term rate hike, noting that recent price rises were driven by global commodity inflation and will prove short-lived.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Australia's central bank will hike interest rates by another half-point on Tuesday and increase borrowing costs further than previously thought in its most aggressive tightening cycle since the 1990s to arrest red hot inflation, a Reuters poll showed.

At the August meeting, Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor Philip Lowe tempered guidance on further hikes as they were approaching the estimated neutral level of 2.50%, a level that neither stimulates nor restricts economic activity.

But with the U.S. Federal Reserve raising rates by 75 basis points last week and expected to take borrowing costs higher than previously expected many central banks are likely to follow suit to prevent their currencies from weakening further against the U.S. dollar.

The Australian dollar, down over 12% for the year, touched its lowest level in two years on Wednesday.

Over a 70% majority of economists, 21 of 29, in the Sept. 26-29 Reuters poll predicted the RBA would hike its cash rate by half a point to 2.85% at its Oct. 4 meeting. The remaining eight forecast a smaller 25 basis point hike.

If realized, that would mark the fifth successive 50 basis point rise, matching the fastest hiking cycle since 1994 when rates went from 4.75% to 7.50%.

""A lot of global interest rate expectations are being set in the United States,"" said Tony Morris, head of Australia and New Zealand economics at Bank of America.

""If the Reserve Bank doesn't maintain the current pace, then further currency weakness will feed through into a much faster pace of domestic inflation.""

Although the median forecast showed rates going up another 50 basis points next quarter to peak at 3.35% there was a five way split among economists over where it would be at end-2022.

While 11 of 27 economists held the median view, one said 3.50% and two said 3.60%. Among the remaining 13 economists, ten said rates would end the year at 3.10% and three said 2.85%.

Only four of 29 economists predicted the cash rate at 3.35% by end-2022 in an August poll when the peak rate was expected to be 3.10%.

With inflation at a 21-year high of 6.1%, more than twice the RBA's target range of 2%-3% and forecast to stay about above that until early 2024, peak interest rate could be revised up again.

Indeed, 11 of 25, or 44%, of analysts expected rates to go higher than the current expected peak of 3.35% by the end of Q1 2023.

The survey showed inflation averaging 7.0% this quarter and then peaking at 7.5% in the next. Across 2023 it was predicted to average 4.5% and then fall to 2.7% in 2024.

A new official monthly measure of Australian consumer prices on Thursday showed annual inflation eased slightly to 6.8% in August from 7.0% in July.

""Our expectation is conditional on several factors such as medium-term inflation expectations remaining well anchored, a sustainable pick up in wage growth and easing global inflationary pressures,"" said Jameson Coombs, economist at St. George Bank.

""If upside risks to inflation materialised, the RBA Board may need to go beyond our expectation for the terminal rate.""

Australia's economic growth was predicted to average 4.0% for this year and then halve to 2.0% in 2023 and 2024.

Michael Burry expects US stocks to fall further and many investors to incur heavy losses.

The ""Big Short"" investor compared the ongoing market slump to the onset of the dot-com crash.

Burry slammed the passive-investing boom for inflating asset prices in recent years.

Michael Burry warned US stocks have further to fall, compared the current market downturn to the onset of the dot-com crash, and predicted many investors would suffer painful losses in a flurry of since-deleted tweets over the weekend.

The investor of ""The Big Short"" fame noted in a Friday tweet that there are 218 companies with a primary stock listing in the US, a market capitalization north of $1 billion, and annual losses exceeding $100 million. Of those, 29 boast market caps over $10 billion and are worth a combined $655 billion, he added.

""Saying it again. ALL the silliness must go,"" Burry wrote. He was nodding to a tweet in August in which he complained that ""COVID-era silliness"" had returned to markets, and emphasized that such speculation had inflated past bubbles but eventually disappeared every time.

The Scion Asset Management boss pointed out in a Saturday tweet that 13.48% of US stocks closed above their 200-day moving average on Friday. That percentage was 1.2% when the market bottomed in 2009, and 2.8% in 2020, he noted.

""Currently at December 2007 levels,"" he added, suggesting he expects stocks to drop significantly lower before bottoming out. Burry has previously suggested the S&P 500, which is already down about 25% this year, could plunge another 48% to around 1,900 points.

In a Sunday tweet, Burry said the current market backdrop reminded him of the second half of 2000 — some unloved stocks were trading at bargain prices, but high-flying names had further to fall.

""Another feeling I'm getting is mid-late 2000,"" he said. ""Free cash flow totally on sale and ignored while former momentum stocks are coming down but not far enough, and darling 'better businesses' still had a ways to fall. Value was about to take off for years despite more crash on the way.""

Story continues

In a follow-up tweet, Burry accused index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) of mindlessly driving up asset prices. He also compared the market to a packed theater, and warned many investors would be crushed as they all rushed for the exits.

""Difference between now and 2000 is the passive investing bubble that inflated steadily over the last decade,"" he wrote. ""All theaters are overcrowded and the only way anyone can get out is by trampling each other. And still the door is only so big.""

Burry is best known for his billion-dollar bet against the mid-2000s housing bubble, which was chronicled in the book and the movie ""The Big Short."" He also placed wagers against Elon Musk's Tesla and Cathie Wood's Ark Innovation fund last year, and purchased a stake in GameStop before it became a meme stock.

The Scion chief has been predicting a devastating market collapse for a while. He highlighted ""the greatest speculative bubble of all time in all things"" in June last year, and warned it would end in the ""mother of all crashes.""

Michael Burry, one of the few investors to see the financial crisis coming, fears the current market mayhem could be the prelude to an even greater catastrophe.

""Today I wondered aloud if this could be worse than 2008,"" Burry said in a now-deleted tweet on Thursday. ""What interest rates are doing, exchange rates globally, central banks seem reactionary and in CYA mode,"" he added, using an acronym for ""cover your a--.""

Burry was likely referring to the Federal Reserve and other central banks frantically raising rates to curb stubborn inflation. The Fed's aggressive hikes, combined with overseas headwinds such as the Russia-Ukraine war and continued lockdowns in China, have driven the US dollar to record highs against other world currencies such as the British pound.

Moreover, the Bank of England embarked on a £65 billion ($72 billion) bond-buying spree this week, as soaring gilt yields were threatening the UK's financial stability. As for the People's Bank of China, it is reportedly preparing state-run banks to sell dollars and buy offshore yuan in a bid to shore up the Chinese currency.

Soaring rates, whipsawing currencies, and authorities scrambling to calm markets and prevent economic disasters are clearly red flags to Burry, and remind him of the frenzied run up to the Great Recession.

Other experts have voiced similar concerns, warning an overzealous Fed could plunge the US economy into a deep recession or spark ""stagflation,"" where inflation remains high but growth stagnates and unemployment jumps. They have also cautioned that volatile markets and a loss of trust in policymakers could threaten consumer and investor sentiment, undercutting growth.

Burry shot to fame after he predicted and profited from the collapse of the mid-2000s housing bubble, and his wager was immortalized in the book and the movie ""The Big Short.""

The Scion Asset Management boss is also known for betting against Elon Musk's Tesla and Cathie Wood's Ark Innovation fund last year, and for buying a stake in GameStop before it became a meme stock. Moreover, he diagnosed ""the greatest speculative bubble of all time in all things"" in June last year, and predicted it would end in the ""mother of all crashes.""

Burry ended his Thursday tweet on an ominous note. He wrote that one of his analysts said it was ""spooky"" to hear him compare the current chaos to the 2008 meltdown, on the 14th anniversary of Congress failing to pass a $700 billion plan to bail out banks reeling from the housing crash. The news sparked one of the steepest one-day declines in US stocks in history.

fa4fbfc7-2fe6-4fb8-9db1-5e7e57e27710,"September has a deserved reputation for being a troublesome month in financial markets.

© Reuters

It was, for example, the month in which Black Wednesday saw sterling ejected ignominiously from the Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1992 and the month in which Northern Rock collapsed in 2007.

By then, the global financial crisis was well under way, an unfolding disaster that reached its most frightening moment with the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers in September 2008.

Pound falls again as Truss and Kwarteng issue statement - economy latest

So it is a month in which all market participants, whatever asset class they trade, know they have to be on their guard.

It is unlikely that Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng, both of whom worked in business before going into politics, would not have known this.

If they did not, the new prime minister and chancellor certainly do now, following a tumultuous week.

For most people who may not necessarily pay attention to events in financial markets, the wild gyrations have been best summed up by the pound, which even before Mr Kwarteng's ultra-expansionary budget last Friday had fallen by 16% against the US dollar since the start of the year.

Sterling promptly tanked last Friday as investors took fright at billions of pounds worth of unexpected borrowing and finished the week at $1.0856.

The rout picked up pace in Asian markets in the early hours of Monday morning when most Britons were asleep, sterling plunging to a new all-time of $1.0382, a level surpassing even the $1.054 hit on 25 February 1985.

The pound rallied after London opened and continued to grind higher on Tuesday, with the Bank of England's crucial intervention on Wednesday in the gilt market helping it to further gains that day and on Thursday, although it has sold off again today on news that Mr Kwarteng will not be bringing forward, as many would have liked, his medium term fiscal plan from 23 November.

Nonetheless, sterling goes into the weekend having clawed back the majority of losses it has racked up since the Chancellor's mini-Budget.

The same cannot be said for gilts.

The yield (which moves in the opposite direction to the price) for government IOUs rocketed last Friday and continued to climb during the first half of the week.

Then came Wednesday and the Bank's decisive move to buy what is eventually expected to be £65bn worth of 20 and 30 year gilts after those particular assets had been subjected to forced selling by pension funds after strains emerged due to a hitherto obscure part of the sector known as liability driven investing (LDI).

Yet the Bank's intervention - restricted to 20 and 30 year UK government debt only - has only partially repaired the damage.

The yield on 2-year gilts (a good indicator of where the market thinks short term interest rates are heading) hit 4.761% on Tuesday morning - a level last seen in August 2008 - and at the time of writing was still above 4%.

To put that into context, before Mr Kwarteng began speaking last Friday, it was just under 3.5%.

These are huge moves by the standards of these assets.

Similarly the yield on the 10-year benchmark gilt, which had been just under 3.5% before the mini-budget, had blasted to 4.582% at one point on Wednesday before coming off slightly.

It remains above 4%.

Only in the 20 and 30 year maturities, where the Bank has been active, is the yield back to levels approaching where they were a week ago.

These numbers matter.

They are not just arcane figures that should only be of interest to traders and investors, but should matter to us all because gilt yields represent the implied borrowing costs for the UK government.

By contrast, the equity markets have been rather subdued this week by comparison with sterling and gilts, although they too have had a poor week.

The FTSE-100 has fallen by 4% since Mr Kwarteng began speaking and has closed below the psychological 7,000 level for the first time since early March.

Worse still has been the showing from the FTSE Mid-250, which has fallen by close to 7.5% since the morning of the mini-budget.

There are straightforward reasons for this.

The FTSE-100 is packed with big multinational oil, mining, pharmaceutical and consumer goods companies - the likes of AstraZeneca, Shell, Unilever, Diageo and Rio Tinto - that derive the majority of their earnings in dollars or euros.

When sterling falls against the dollar, dollar earnings translate into more pounds.

By contrast, the Mid-250 is more of a domestic index, packed with companies like ITV, Marks & Spencer and Direct Line that make the majority of their profits in this country.

Worryingly for the new prime minister, who has emphasised her determination to make the UK a more attractive investment destination, overseas financiers have been paying attention for all the wrong reasons.

Roger Altman, the influential founder of the investment bank Evercore and a former deputy US Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration, told CNBC that Liz Truss was ""giving a masterclass in how not to do it"".

He added: ""She's got off to a pretty bad start. The biggest problem facing the UK, as in the US, is inflation.

""Your first step (as a new PM) should not be to dramatically loosen fiscal policy.""

It has, then, not been a week for Mr Kwarteng to look back on fondly as he sits down to write the speech he plans to deliver to the Conservative faithful in Birmingham on Monday.

But remember that wisdom about September being a bad month for markets.

This one has also been pretty terrible for stock and bond investors elsewhere.

Asian stocks have had their worst month since the onset of the pandemic in February 2020.

The Hang Seng in Hong Kong, where house prices have started to fall and where concerns are mounting over the commercial property sector, has fallen by nearly 14% this month.

The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo has given up 6.25%.

Bigger headache to come if chancellor's sums found not to add up

In the United States, the S&P 500, the most important US stock index, is looking at a fall of almost 8% for the month and has completed a third consecutive quarterly reverse.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is also heading for a fall on the month of more than 7% and has just entered bear market territory, in other words, it is off 20% from its most recent peak.

The Nasdaq Composite, meanwhile, has fallen in six of the last seven weeks and looks set to finish September down by more than 9%.

Things have been no prettier in the market for US Treasuries, which is bracing itself for further interest rate hikes from the US Federal Reserve, which has raised its main policy rate by 75 basis points in each of the last three meetings and which has said it is even prepared to countenance a recession if that is the price required to squeeze inflation from the system.

The yield on 10-year US Treasuries briefly hit 4.0190% - a level last seen in October 2008 - on Wednesday and has shot up from just 3.132% at the end of August.

As Mr Altman put it: ""I've never seen a period with such uncertainty and markets hate uncertainty.""

European stocks and bonds have equally had a September to forget.

The DAX in Frankfurt, the CAC 40 in Paris and the IBEX in Madrid all look set to have lost more than 6% this month and the MIB in Milan only slightly less.

Meanwhile, the 10-year bund has seen its yield spike from 1.536% at the end of August to as much as 2.352% on Wednesday this week, another big movement.

This reflects the likelihood of further interest rate rises in the near future from the European Central Bank, not to mention a deteriorating outlook in Germany, whose government this week announced €200billion worth of borrowing to insulate its households and businesses from higher energy prices - a price tag bigger even than the money Ms Truss has committed to helping UK homes and businesses.

The same is true in other maturities of German debt.

The 5-year bund - a financial instrument so in demand that it has carried a negative yield since 2015 until March this year (in other words, investors have actually been paying the German government for the right to lend to it) - has seen its yield spike this month from 1.381% to 2.051% on Wednesday.

So, while UK financial assets have had a bad September, it has been a similar story elsewhere - although, as Huw Pill, the Bank of England's chief economist, noted on Thursday, there are specific UK issues at play.

Will October be better?

Don't count on it.

Mr Kwarteng has vowed not to hold his medium fiscal event until 23 November and the Bank of England has said its Monetary Policy Committee will not be meeting until 3 November.

Markets, like nature, abhore a vacuum and they now face a month likely to be dominated by speculation and conjecture.

And October, by the way, is also an awful month for stock markets in particular.

The Wall Street Crash of 1929, Black Monday in 1987 and the hedge fund crisis of 1998 all happened in October."
6dc58cef-a123-4d3a-88b9-b940d691e606,"What happens next? It was an extraordinary week and, for Britain, a miserable one. So, first, let's take stock.

The reaction on the gilt market and foreign exchanges undid any hopes we might have had that the growth package could work. Any fiscal boost will be offset by higher interest rates.

The damage from our Prime Minister and Chancellor failing to grasp that they had to get the markets onside – and that meant getting an endorsement from the Office for Budget Responsibility – can't be undone. Going to the OBR now helps at the margin, but its assessment, to be delivered to the Treasury next Friday, will duly be leaked and will not be pretty.

Rise: The European Central Bank has signalled a sharp increase in rates next month, with further hikes to come

Our own mess, however, was not the only thing that went haywire.

There was a collapse of confidence in US markets. The most important share index, the S&P500, dipped below its previous bottom in June and the Nasdaq index of high-tech shares was close to its floor too. They are down 24 per cent and 32 per cent respectively so far this year.

The yield on US ten-year Treasury debt, having touched 4 per cent, is still at 3.7 per cent, which compares with 10-year gilts at 4.1 per cent. Ironically, it was the Bank of England's intervention on the gilt market that pulled US yields down, for it showed that central banks can act decisively when they have to.

But US financial confidence remains very fragile. We look at the strong dollar and worry about the weak pound; Americans see distress sellers of equities and a housing market that is tanking.

The other fragile element is Europe. German inflation, at 10.9 per cent, is higher than ours. In the Netherlands it is 17.1 per cent. Italian 10-year government debt yields 4.5 per cent, higher than ours. Inflation in France, on the other hand is only 6.2 per cent.

Yet the European Central Bank has to set interest rates for a different set of countries in very different circumstances. It has signalled a sharp increase in rates next month, with further hikes to come.

So what's to look for? Let's start with the UK. Here the question is whether this Government can get to its scheduled Budget on November 23 without some sort of market (or political) event intervening.

There was disappointment on Friday that the official OBR forecast had not been brought forward, and I would give the Government not much better than evens on getting there without some sort of radical shift.

Meanwhile, interest rates will continue to climb and that will take its toll on the mortgage market. The present shock will subside and, quite soon, loans will become available again. But they will be more expensive. Some people won't be able to keep up payments and others won't bid for houses at all.

However I don't think that, even if prices do fall, the downturn will be as serious as the last one in 2008/9, when they declined on average by 15 per cent.

With luck, we will get stable prices and a gradual improvement in affordability as incomes rise. Does that mean a recession next year? We seem to be squeaking by this year without one, but what happens in 2023 will be determined more by international factors than by what we do or don't do.

I am sure that both the pound and UK equities are undervalued by world standards, but they may become even more undervalued before sentiment turns. A huge amount of what happens to us depends on what happens in the US. There is a real possibility the Federal Reserve will jack rates up too hard. A huge amount of wealth has already been destroyed.

The equity strategists are crawling over the data on previous bear markets and the consensus seems to be emerging that this one has some way to go before it hits bottom.

I can see too some sort of financial crisis in Europe as interest rates rise. Maybe there will be a rerun of the Eurozone crisis of 2010/11. But, this time, the trigger being inflation rather than country indebtedness.

And the turning point, when clouds lift, rates and inflation come back down?

What usually happens is there is some kind of seismic event, such as the collapse of Lehman Brothers, that forces central banks and governments to work together to steady things.

We are not there at the moment, so this bumpy ride goes on a while yet."

WASHINGTON (AP) — Consumers spent a bit more in August than the previous month, a sign the economy is holding up even as inflation lifts prices for food, rent, and other essentials.

Americans boosted their spending at stores and for services such as haircuts by 0.4% in August, after it fell 0.2% in July, the Commerce Department said Friday. Yet much of that increase reflected higher prices, with an inflation gauge closely monitored by the Federal Reserve rising 0.3% in August, the government’s report showed.

The figures suggest that the economy is showing some resilience despite sharply rising interest rates, violent swings in the stock market, and high inflation.

Still, there were signs that rising prices are weighing on shoppers. Consumer spending, adjusted for inflation, is growing at a weaker pace. It increased at an annual rate of 2% in the April-June quarter. Yet July and August data indicate that spending growth is on track to slow to an annual rate of just 0.5% in the July-September quarter, economists said.

The economy is expected to grow in the third quarter, after shrinking in the first six months of this year . But many economists lowered their forecasts after the spending report and now expect growth will be just 1% or so at an annual rate.

Americans are also saving less in order to keep up with higher prices. The U.S. saving rate was just 3.5% in August, far below pre-pandemic levels of about 8%, Friday’s report said.

There have been other signs of consumer weakness recently, with used car seller Carmax reporting sharply lower sales in the three months ending in August. The company attributed the decline to “affordability challenges” for consumers amid high inflation and rising interest rates.

Compared with a year ago, prices jumped 6.2%, down from a 6.4% annual gain in July but not far from June’s four-decade high of 7%. The figure is lower than the more widely-known consumer price index, released earlier this month, which reported an 8.3% price gain in August from a year earlier.

The two indexes differ for several reasons. For example, the consumer price index puts much greater weight on rents and housing costs, which have been rising steadily, than the measure released Friday, known as the price index for personal consumption expenditures.

ADVERTISEMENT

Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 0.6%, much faster than July’s flat reading. They increased 4.9% from a year earlier, up from July’s figure of 4.6%.

Those figures were higher than expected, and may make the Federal Reserve more likely to lift its benchmark interest rate by another hefty 0.75 percentage point at its next meeting in November. If so, that would be the fourth such hike in a row.

The inflation figures in Friday’s report echoed those released earlier this month , with core prices rising more quickly than headline inflation. Falling gas prices have reduced overall inflation, while stubbornly high costs for housing, cars, and services such as health care and hair cuts have pushed core prices higher.

ADVERTISEMENT

Adjusted for inflation, consumer spending ticked up 0.1% last month, after falling slightly in July.

Friday’s report also showed that personal income rose 0.3% in August for the second month in a row. Adjusted for price increases, disposable income -- what is leftover after taxes -- ticked up 0.1%, after a hefty 0.5% gain in July.

But over a longer time frame, incomes are trailing inflation. In the April-June quarter, inflation-adjusted disposable income fell 1.5% at an annual rate.

The Federal Reserve is seeking to wrestle inflation under control with its most rapid series of interest rate hikes in four decades . It has pushed its benchmark short-term rate to a range of 3% to 3.25%, the highest since early 2008, up from nearly zero in March.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other officials have repeatedly underscored the Fed’s determination to bring prices down, even if their rate hikes result in layoffs and a higher unemployment rate.

The Fed intends its interest rate increases to slow borrowing and spending, which should in turn reduce inflation pressures in the economy.

Inflation has spiked globally, contributing to economic and financial turmoil in the United Kingdom, Europe, and a slew of developing countries, from Turkey to Argentina.

Also Friday, the 19 countries that use the euro currency reported that inflation spiked 10% from a year earlier , as prices for natural gas and electricity soared. European countries are struggling with an energy crunch in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as Russia has reduced its supplies of natural gas to the European Union."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending increased more than expected in August, but stubbornly high inflation is dampening demand, potentially limiting an anticipated rebound in economic growth this quarter.

The report from the Commerce Department on Friday also showed underlying inflation pressures building up last month, providing cover for the Federal Reserve to remain on its aggressive monetary policy tightening path.

Wage growth also appears to be slowing and consumers are tapping excess savings to offset high prices. That, combined with stiff interest rate hikes from the Fed, has increased the economy's vulnerability to a recession next year.

""More pain lies ahead as the economy heads toward a moderate downturn in the first half of next year,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""This will eventually cool inflation, but not before the Fed takes a few more swings at the tightening can.""

Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.4% last month after falling 0.2% in July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending rising 0.2%.

Revisions to the data from 2017 showed consumer spending was a bit stronger than previously thought and the level of savings was lower. Some of the increase in spending last month reflected higher prices, especially for housing and utilities.

Spending was led by services, where outlays surged 0.8% after edging up 0.1% in July. There were also increases in spending on transportation services, healthcare as well as dining out, hotel and motel accommodation.

But outlays on recreational services fell, a sign that consumers were cutting back on discretionary spending.

Spending on goods dropped 0.5%, held down by a decrease in receipts at gasoline service stations amid lower gasoline prices. Goods spending fell 0.7% in July. There were also declines in spending on recreational goods, another indication consumers were pulling back on discretionary spending. Outlays on furniture and other long-lasting manufactured goods fell.

But spending on motor vehicles rose. Overall, spending is rotating back to services from goods.

Gasoline prices dropped 11.8% to $3.691 per gallon in August from July, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That, however, offered little relief on the inflation front last month, with services prices rising 0.6%.

The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index gained 0.3% after dipping 0.1% in July. In the 12 months through August, the PCE price index increased 6.2% after advancing 6.4% in July. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index jumped 0.6% after being unchanged in July. The so-called core PCE price index climbed 4.9% on a year-on-year basis in August after increasing 4.7% in July.

The Fed tracks the PCE price indexes for its 2% inflation target. Other inflation measures are running much higher. The consumer price index increased 8.3% year-on-year in August.

Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell.

WAGE GROWTH SLOWING

Inflation has, however, likely peaked. A separate report on Friday showed the University of Michigan survey's one-year consumer inflation expectations slipped to a reading of 4.7% in September. That was the lowest since September 2021 and down from 4.8% in August. The survey's five-year inflation outlook fell to 2.7% from 2.9% in August, dropping below the 2.9%-3.1% range for the first time since July 2021.

The Fed last week raised its policy interest rate by 75 basis points, its third straight increase of that size, and signaled more large increases to come this year.

Since March, the U.S. central bank has hiked its policy rate from near zero to the current range of 3.00% to 3.25%. Last week, the Fed raised its median forecast for core PCE inflation to 4.5% this year from its previous estimate of 4.3% in June. Its estimate for core inflation in 2023 was boosted to 3.1% from the previously projected 2.7% in June.

High inflation is cutting into spending. Inflation-adjusted consumer spending edged up 0.1% in August after dipping 0.1% in the prior month. That suggests consumer spending could be tepid this quarter after helping to blunt the drag on gross domestic product from a slowdown in the pace of inventory accumulation in the second quarter.

Consumer spending increased at a 2% annualized rate in the second quarter. The economy contracted at a 0.6% pace last quarter after shrinking at a 1.6% rate in the January-March quarter. Goldman Sachs cut its third-quarter GDP growth forecast by 0.5 percentage point to a 0.9% rate on the spending data.

Growth this quarter is seen driven largely by a narrowing trade deficit. An accumulation of inventory, part of it unsold goods because of slowing demand, is also seen supporting GDP growth this quarter.

""The near-term outlook remains modest at best,"" said Scott Hoyt, senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Rising interest rates will make new borrowing more expensive, undermining spending on big-ticket items typically bought on credit.""

Consumer spending is likely to remain moderate, with wage growth showing signs of slowing. Personal income rose 0.3% in August, matching the prior month's gain.

Wages increased 0.3% after surging 0.8% in July. The saving rate was unchanged at 3.5%. July's saving rate was slashed to 3.5% from the previously reported 5.0%. The saving rate was as high as 26.3% in March 2021. It is now near levels seen during the 2007-09 Great Recession.

""It looks like consumers have been eating into the 'excess saving' built up over the earlier stages of the pandemic to fuel recent spending,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.

Key Inflation Gauge Jumps, Investors Ramp Up Bets for a More Aggressive Fed

U.S. inflation rates rose higher than expected in August, as investors expect a more aggressive monetary policy by the Federal Reserve in its efforts to curtail inflation toward the central bank’s preferred target of 2 percent.

The keenly watched Personal Consumption Expenditures price index (PCE) was published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis on Sept. 30.

The PCE, excluding the volatile prices of food and energy, rose 0.6 percent in August, after little growth in July, well above the 0.5 percent that many economists had predicted.

The news is another sign that inflation is spreading across the economy.

Core PCE, a key measure closely watched by the Fed, increased 4.9 percent year over year last month.

Inflation is still running well above the central bank’s long-run target of 2 percent.

The U.S. economy has been contending with its highest inflation since 1981, which currently stands at 8.3 percent as of August.

The Fed has been pushing a series of interest-rate hikes since March to combat the substantial rise in prices.

The central bank raised interest rates by 75 basis points last week for the third consecutive time, into a range of 3.0–3.25 percent, their highest levels since just before the Great Recession of 2008–09.

The Fed generally favors core PCE as the broadest indicator of where prices are heading, which it then uses to adjust for consumer behavior.

“Core inflation is a better predictor of inflation going forward,” said Fed Chair Jerome Powell at a press conference. “Headline inflation tends to be volatile.”

This was more than the 4.7 percent estimate for August, the same rate as the previous month.

Inflation is currently widespread, high, and persistent, according to Thomas Barkin, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, on Sept. 30.

Barkin said that the Fed would “persist” with interest-rate increases and “not declare victory prematurely.”

However, he still sees “promising signs” of improvement and that “inflation should come down. But I don’t expect its drop to be immediate or predictable.”

Headline PCE. including gas and energy, increased 0.3 percent in August, over a decline of 0.1 percent in July.

Prices jumped despite a sharp decline in average gas prices in August, after fuel costs fell below their high of $5 per gallon in June.

Other than inflation, average American income and spending grew last month.

Managing Inflation and Interest Rates

Personal income jumped 0.3 percent in August, in line with last month, while spending rates rose 0.4 percent after a decline in July, above previous expectations.

Meanwhile, inflation-adjusted spending rose 0.1 percent last month.

The PCE data have shown a consumer shift in spending, from goods back to services.

Service spending saw respective gains of 0.3 percent and 0.6 percent in the month.

Food prices rose 0.8 percent, while energy dropped 5.5 percent due to falling gas prices.

Housing and utilities costs were up 1 percent, while health care jumped 0.6 percent.

Investors predict that the new report will likely mean that the Fed will persist with its hawkish policy, as inflation has not been affect so far by the boost in rates.

“Futures indicate that traders see a 68 percent chance of the Fed raising rates 75 basis points at its November meeting, up from 61 percent prior to the release of U.S. PCE inflation data,” noted Breaking Market News in a tweet.

Fed officials said they will remain vigilant about the need to keep tightening policy until the the rate hikes bring down prices.

However, many economists are concerned that higher interest rates run the risk of causing the economy to slow down too fast and cause a major economic downturn.

Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard cautioned investors on Friday against “prematurely” ending the hawkish rate policy, explaining that interest rates will remain higher “for some time” until inflation is brought under control.

“Inflation is very high in the United States and abroad, and the risk of additional inflationary shocks cannot be ruled out,” she said.

“Monetary policy will need to be restrictive for some time to have confidence that inflation is moving back to target,” said Brainard at a meeting in New York.

“For these reasons, we are committed to avoiding pulling back prematurely.”"
6b39014a-a8aa-4a27-acbf-91108dfe7b6a,"













Sept 30 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve policymakers, who have driven U.S. borrowing costs up faster this year than at any time since the 1980s, got one less reason to slow down on Friday after a government report showed inflation continues to run at a red-hot pace.

The personal consumption expenditures price index, the measure by which the Fed targets 2% inflation, rose 6.2% in August from a year earlier, down from 6.4% in July, the Commerce Department reported. Underlying inflation, as measured by a core reading that excludes food and energy prices, rose 4.9% in the 12 months through August, up from 4.7% in the prior month.

Even before the report the Fed was widely expected to deliver a fourth straight 75-basis-point interest rate hike at its next policy meeting in November.

U.S. central bank policymakers have increased their benchmark policy rate by 3 percentage points to a range of 3.00% to 3.25%, and have signaled they expect to deliver another 1.5 percentage points of rate hikes by early next year, and then keep the policy rate there through 2023 to slow the economy and undercut price pressures that have been running at 40-year highs.

""What we need to see is decreasing inflation on a sequential basis, and we're just not seeing that yet,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth.

The Fed got some relief on Friday from a University of Michigan survey that showed consumers see inflation five years from now at 2.7%, its lowest reading of longer-term inflation expectations since April 2021.

U.S. interest rate futures contracts are pricing in about a 60% chance the Fed will raise rates by three-quarters of a percentage point at the Nov. 1-2 policy meeting, versus about a 40% chance of a smaller half-percentage-point hike, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.

Investors who are hoping for a policy pivot should be wary, as a rate cut at this point would be the Federal Reserve's response to a major shock, according to top economist Mohamed El-Erian.

After inflation showed signs of cooling off over the summer, some on Wall Street called for the Fed to pivot away from its tightening campaign. But policymakers have been steadfast in their commitment to bringing inflation down to their 2% target.

""All of you who are looking for a pivot be careful what you wish for. Because this pivot only happens if you have an economic accident or a financial accident. And the journey to an economic accident and financial accident is a very painful journey,"" El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Friday.

To be sure, notable market bears have been sounding the alarm on possible financial calamities. ""Big Short"" investor Michael Burry warned that aggressive Fed rate hikes could mean a market crash even more severe that what unfolded in 2008, and economist Nouriel Roubini has warned stocks could sink as much as 40%.

Meanwhile, the UK bond market threatened to crash this week as yields soared after tax-cut plans were unveiled, forcing the Bank of England to buy gilts.

That followed recent moves from other global central banks, including the Bank of Japan's intervention in the currency market to prop up the yen.

On Friday, El-Erian dismissed such emergency actions as short-term Band-Aids. ""And it tells you that the global economy is not clearing on its own. Or if it's allowed to clear on its own, there's going to be a lot of collateral damage. When you distort an economy for so long, getting out of the distortion is by definition problematic,"" he warned."
aadbb0ea-df82-4f68-8300-2036ea477fd4,"© Photo by Rob Kim/Getty Images The 'disorderly' moves in the pound and loss of confidence in UK policy makers is historic, and point to the paradigm shift markets are headed towards, Mohamed El-Erian says

The drop in the pound and the loss of confidence in policy makers is part of a larger paradigm shift, Mohamed El-Erian said.

The economist reiterated that the era of high-liquidity and low-interest rates was over.

The swift drop in the value of the pound against the dollar and the loss of confidence in UK policy makers is a historic moment – and points to a larger paradigm shift in global financial markets, Mohamed El-Erian said on Wednesday.

The top economist pointed to volatility spurred by the UK's new budget plan, which involves cutting taxes for the wealthy and slashing planned corporate tax hikes. It caused the pound to plunge to a 37-year-low on Friday, and to sink another 2% on Monday, with analysts projecting that the UK currency could sink below parity with the dollar next year.

The plan was criticized on Wednesday by the International Monetary Fund, which gave a stinging assessment of the new ""mini-budget"" for its focus on cutting taxes at a time of sky-high inflation. Unfunded tax cuts and increased debt will cause further harm, economists say, and the Bank of England could be forced to hike rates more aggressively than planned and increase the risk of a recession.

""It is amazing that this is a G7 country, that over the last six days, has experienced disorderly moves in the currency and in bond yields, a loss of confidence in policy making, now, direct, central bank intervention, and an IMF warning."" El-Erian said on an interview with CNBC.

""That normally happens in a developing country. It does not happen in a G7 economy. So this is historic. It points to the paradigm shift we're going through and the fragility of markets,"" he added.

El-Erian has previously warned markets of the paradigm shift, pointing to central banks' pivot from quantitative easing to quantitative tightening as inflation continues to climb. That means that the era of high-liquidity and ultra-low interest rates is over – and exiting that regime could result in stagflation, hammering the global economy with of high inflation, high unemployment, and low growth.

""The longer you stay in this la-la-land of [quantitative easing], floored interest rates, dislocated markets, funny interventions, distorted asset allocations, the longer you stay in, the harder the exit. And what we're seeing [in the UK] is that the exit is really complicated,"" El-Erian said.

To combat the potential for higher inflation, the UK will have to hike interest rates to keep inflation under control. But that could also cause enormous financial pain to households, causing unemployment and floating mortgage rates to skyrocket.

It demonstrates the competing paths of the UK's fiscal and monetary policies, and it's critical that the US avoids a similar situation, El-Erian said. He has previously criticized the Fed for not acting on inflation sooner, but has recently urged the central bank to continue hiking rates to bring down runaway-inflation, despite the possibility of slowed growth and high unemployment."

To be sure, notable market bears have been sounding the alarm on possible financial calamities. ""Big Short"" investor Michael Burry warned that aggressive Fed rate hikes could mean a market crash even more severe that what unfolded in 2008, and economist Nouriel Roubini has warned stocks could sink as much as 40%.

Meanwhile, the UK bond market threatened to crash this week as yields soared after tax-cut plans were unveiled, forcing the Bank of England to buy gilts.

That followed recent moves from other global central banks, including the Bank of Japan's intervention in the currency market to prop up the yen."
808d5ce1-ea51-4021-9452-8e4978750819,"Dear Liz: With the stock market tanking and no rebound likely in the near future, should I decrease the amount I am contributing toward my retirement? I earn a high-five-figure salary and currently contribute 25% of my pay to my company’s 401(k). The current balance is $450,000 with about two-thirds held in a 2030 target date fund and the remainder in a 2035 target date fund. I hope to retire at the end of 2030 at age 64. I have no other retirement accounts, but I am married and my husband collects Social Security and a pension.

It’s hard putting hundreds of dollars into my 401(k) every two weeks only to watch it seemingly disappear. Would it be smart to decrease the percentage I contribute by 5% to 7% and then use that extra money to pay down a $40,000 home equity line of credit? Or should I just stay the course, keep my percentage the same and ride out this bear market?

Answer: Since you’re within 10 years of retirement, it’s time to hire a fee-only financial planner to get specific, individualized advice about your situation. The decisions you make in the years immediately before and after retirement can have a huge impact on how long your money lasts. Mistakes made in this time frame can be difficult if not impossible to reverse.

Take, for example, this impulse to reduce your contribution rate. Your money isn’t disappearing; it’s being used to buy stocks at a discount. When the market rebounds, as it inevitably will, those shares you bought on sale will benefit from the growth.

A planner would tell you not to cut retirement contributions simply because stocks had entered a bear market. The logical response to a bear market is to invest more, not less.

That said, variable rate debt is getting more expensive thanks to Federal Reserve Bank rate hikes. Reducing your 401(k) contributions a few percentage points to pay off that debt faster could make sense, especially if you’re not giving up free money in the form of a company match and your reduced savings rate will still allow you to retire on time.

Again, a fee-only financial planner could help you weigh your options and recommend the best path.

Investigate a credit score drop

Dear Liz: I had an 836 credit score as of last week. I’m a business owner and have been using my company credit card to pay bills on a large project to get 2% cash back. I charged $52,000 of the $70,000 I have available on that one card. (I have about $175,000 available across the three business cards I have) and my credit score went down to 699! I pay my cards off within days of receiving my statements. Is this a bad use of my cards? How long do you think it will take to get my score back up? Side note: I don’t need any more credit, but my business line of credit is coming up for renewal and I am buying a new truck in two months. Do you think this will be an issue?

Answer: Lower scores could cause you to pay more for credit, so it’s worth fixing this issue promptly.

There’s nothing wrong with using your cards to get rewards, as long as you’re paying your balances in full and not using too much of your available credit. Ideally, you’d use less than 10% of the limit on any card at any given time. (Credit scoring formulas pay close attention to the amount of credit you’re using on each revolving account as well as how much of your available credit you’re using overall.)

If you need to use a lot more of your credit limit, consider making more than one payment a month. Some people make bi-weekly or even weekly payments to keep their balances low.

(The balances that factor into your scores are typically the amounts that you owe on your statement closing date.)

Credit card issuers typically report to the credit bureaus every month, so it shouldn’t take more than 30 days for lower balances to improve your scores.

It’s a little unusual, however, for a business credit card to affect your personal credit scores. Typically, business accounts don’t show up on your credit reports, even if you used your personal credit history to apply for the cards. You may want to pull your three credit reports from AnnualCreditReport.com to see if other problems may have contributed to your score drop.

European stock markets pushed higher on Friday as new data showed that inflation in the eurozone hit a record rate of 10% in September, while the UK economy grew in the second quarter.

In London, the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) gained almost 0.4% by the end of the session, heading back towards 7,000 points after a sharp rout this week. Meanwhile the CAC (^FCHI) rose 1.5% in Paris, and the Frankfurt DAX (^GDAXI) was 1.2% higher.

According to the latest data from Eurostat, price growth in the 19 countries sharing the euro jumped from August’s 9.1% to 10% in September, higher than the 9.7% forecast by economists.

This points to another big interest rate hike from the European Central Bank (ECB) at its next meeting.

Inflation in Germany, Europe's largest economy, jumped from 8.8% to 10.9%, and price growth in Italy hit 9.5%, up from 9.1%, while French inflation slowed to 6.2% from 6.6%.

Meanwhile, the unemployment rate in the eurozone was 6.6% in August, stable compared with July and down from 7.5% in August 2021.

“The latest rise in euro area inflation to fresh highs may mark the peak, but that doesn’t make the continent’s situation any less concerning,"" Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Global Investors, said.

""Indeed, while headline inflation may start to ease as a result of base effects and volatile energy prices, with the unemployment rate itself at a new low, core inflation is building momentum and is likely to rise further in the coming months.""

It came as the Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that gross domestic product (GDP) in the UK increased by 0.2% from April to June, an improvement on the previously forecast decline of 0.1%.

But it added that the economy’s overall size is smaller than previously estimated, 0.2% below its pre-pandemic level.

The UK economy is also estimated to have shrunk by 11% during the first year of the pandemic, rather than 9.3% as previously thought.

Story continues

“The good news is that the economy is not already in recession. The bad news is that contrary to previous thinking, it still hasn’t returned to pre-pandemic levels. It’s the only G7 economy in that situation and it makes the chancellor’s fiscal plans look even more untenable,” Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said.

Read more: Why has the pound fallen and what does this mean for you?

“So despite the better news on the performance of the economy in Q2, the overall picture is that the economy is in worse shape than we previously thought. And that’s before the full drag from the surge in inflation and leap in borrowing costs have been felt.”

Meanwhile, Prime minister Liz Truss and chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng met the chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to discuss the fallout since last Friday's mini-budget.

After the meeting, which lasted less than an hour, the OBR said that its independent forecasts will be ready to be delivered to the chancellor on 7 October, which “will, as always, be based on our independent judgment about economic and fiscal prospects and the impact of the government’s policies”.

However, the UK government is set to publish the forecasts on 23 November, despite calls for them to be revealed earlier.

Watch: Truss and Kwarteng meet with OBR amid market turmoil and party concerns

Across the pond on Wall Street, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.8% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) climbed 1.3% by the time of the European close. The Dow Jones (^DJI) was 0.4% higher.

It came despite jitters in currency and bond markets, which persisted over hawkish talk from central banks, worries about global recession, and rising geopolitical risk.

However, each of the major indices are ending the quarter on a sour note. In the year to date, the Dow Jones is down by 20%, the S&P 500 24% and the Nasdaq 31%.

Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: “With volatility and turmoil sweeping across markets due to fears of inflation, recession, currency volatility and escalating geopolitical tensions, there are few signs that the last quarter of the year will be any less challenging for investors.

“The imminent third quarter reporting season will likely show some unpleasant surprises, and individual stocks are likely to be punished for any earnings misses, let alone muted outlook comments.”

Elsewhere, stocks in Asia suffered their worst month since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, recording a near 13% drop during September.

It was the largest decline since March 2020 when COVID threw financial markets into chaos.

In Tokyo, the Nikkei (^N225) fell 1.8% on the day, while the Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) dipped 0.6%. The Hang Seng (^HSI) rose 0.7% in Hong Kong, managing to eke out gains.

The S&P 500 closed out a brutal third quarter on a low note this past week, hitting new 52-week lows.

On Friday, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index gained 6.2% year-over-year in the month of August, down from a 6.3% PCE inflation in July. Core PCE, which excludes volatile food and energy prices and is the preferred inflation measure for the Federal Reserve, was up 4.9% in August, exceeding economist estimates of a 4.6% rise.

The British pound dropped to new all-time lows against the U.S. dollar on Monday in response to new U.K. Prime Minister Liz Truss' bold new economic stimulus plan that included aggressive tax cuts and investment incentives. To stabilize the bond and currency markets, the Bank of England announced on Wednesday that it will suspend its planned bond selling program and will instead begin buying long-dated U.K. government bonds.

Concerns over economic instability in the U.K. sent 10-Year U.S. Treasury yields above 4% in midweek trading before they retreated to 3.73% to finish the week. The S&P 500 also hit a new 52-week low of 3,610.40 on Thursday, its lowest intraday level since 2020.

Bank of America downgraded Apple from ""buy"" to ""neutral"" on Thursday, triggering a sharp sell-off in tech stocks. In the downgrade note, BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan said he expects ""weaker consumer demand"" will prompt analysts to cut their Apple earnings estimates in coming quarters.

Not Rite now

Rite Aid shares traded lower by more than 29% on Thursday after the pharmacy retailer reported a larger-than-expected second-quarter net loss and cut its full-year earnings guidance.

Investors will get more quarterly earnings reports in the week ahead from Lamb Weston on Wednesday, Conagra Brands and Levi Strauss on Thursday and Tilray on Friday.

Wall Street analysts currently project an average of 25.7% upside for the S&P 500 over the next 12 months, according to FactSet.

The sell-off was broad-based and was led by Apple, which tumbled as a major investment bank downgraded the one-time bear market outperformer. The stock closed down 4.9%.

The S&P 500 declined 2.1% to 3,640.47 in a new closing low for the year. During the session, it also fell to a new 2022 intraday low of 3,610.40. This is also its lowest intraday level since 2020.

Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 458.13 points, or 1.54%, to 29,225.61. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 2.84%.

The moves followed a broad rally for stocks Wednesday, as the Bank of England said it would purchase bonds in an effort to help steady its financial markets and the cratering British pound. Sterling has stooped to record lows against the U.S. dollar in recent days.

The Dow on Wednesday gained more than 500 points, or 1.9%, while the S&P 500 rose nearly 2%, both snapping six-day losing streaks.

″[We] remain skeptical that the calmer mood in markets on Wednesday marks an end to the recent period of elevated volatility or risk-off sentiment,” UBS’ Mark Haefele wrote in a Thursday note. “For a more sustained rally, investors will need to see convincing evidence that inflation is coming under control, allowing central banks to become less hawkish.”

The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rebounded to to top 3.7%. A day prior, it posted its biggest one-day drop since 2020 after briefly surpassing 4%.

A stronger-than-expected jobless claims report didn’t help sentiment. This built on the notion that the Fed will keep raising rates to fight inflation without concern that it could hurt the labor market.

Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester said in a Thursday appearance on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” that interest rates are not yet restrictive, saying there’s more to be done to bring down inflation.

The major averages are on pace for a losing week and a month of sharp declines. The Nasdaq Composite is leading the monthly losses, down 9.1%, while the Dow and S&P are on pace to end September roughly 7.3% and 7.9% lower, respectively.

The Associated Press

Wall Street closed out a miserable September on Friday with the S&P 500's worst monthly skid since March 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic crashed global markets.

The benchmark index ended the month with a 9.3% loss and posted its third straight losing quarter. It’s now at its lowest level since November 2020 and is down by more than a quarter since the start of the year.

The main reason financial markets continue to struggle is fear about a possible recession, as interest rates soar in hopes of beating down the high inflation that's swept the world.

“Quite frankly, if it’s a deep recession you’re going to have to see more of a sell-off,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial. “This is what the market is trying to navigate now.""

The Fed stepping in

The Federal Reserve has been at the forefront of the global campaign to slow economic growth and hurt job markets just enough to undercut inflation but not so much that it causes a recession. On Friday, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation showed it was worse last month than economists expected. That should keep the Fed on track to keep hiking rates and hold them at high levels a while, raising the risk of it going too far and causing a downturn.

Vice Chair Lael Brainard was the latest Fed official on Friday to insist it won't pull back on rates prematurely.

“At this point, it’s not a matter of if we’ll have a recession, but what type of recession it will be,” said Sean Sun, portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management.

All told, the S&P 500 fell 54.85 points, or 1.5%, to close at 3,585.62 Friday, after flipping between small losses and gains in the early going. It has now posted a weekly loss in six out of the last seven weeks.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 500.10 points, or 1.7%, to 28,725.51. The Nasdaq composite slid 161.89 points, or 1.5%, to 10,575.62. The tech-heavy index sank 10.5% in September and is down 32.4% so far this year.

Smaller company stocks also had a rough September. The Russell 2000 ended the month down 9.7%. On Friday, it lost 10.21 points, or 0.6%, to 1,664.72.

Higher interest rates knock down one of the main levers that set prices for stocks. The other lever also looks to be under threat as the slowing economy, high interest rates and other factors weigh on corporate profits.

Nike and Carnival stocks tank

Cruise ship operator Carnival dropped 23.3% for the biggest decline among S&P 500 stocks after it reported a bigger loss for its latest quarter than analysts expected and revenue that fell short of expectations. Rivals Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean Group slid 18% and 13.2%, respectively.

Nike slumped 12.8%, its worst day in more than 20 years, after it said its profitability weakened during the summer because of discounts needed to clear suddenly overstuffed warehouses. The amount of shoes and gear in Nike’s inventories swelled by 44% from a year earlier.

This year's powerful surge for the U.S. dollar against other currencies also hurt Nike. Its worldwide revenue rose only 4%, instead of the 10% it would have if currency values had remained the same.

Nike isn't the only company to see its inventories balloon. So have several big-name retailers, and such bad news for businesses could actually mean some relief for shoppers if it leads to more discounts. It echoed some glimmers of encouragement buried within Friday's report on the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation. That showed some slowing of inflation for goods, even as price gains kept accelerating for services.

PCE inflation report

Another report on Friday also offered a glimmer of hope. A measure of consumer sentiment showed U.S. expectations for future inflation came down in September. That's crucial for the Fed because tightly held expectations for higher inflation can create a debilitating, self-reinforcing cycle that worsens it.

Treasury yields initially eased a bit on Friday, letting off some of the pressure that's built on markets, but then turned higher by late afternoon.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.81% from 3.79% late Thursday. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, rose to 4.23% from 4.19%.

Not all stocks took a beating in September. Biogen soared 35%, but it was an outlier. FedEx was among the market's biggest losers, ending the month 29.6% lower.

Looking at the third quarter, which included a market rally in July, Netflix was among the best performers, climbing 34.6%. It's still down 60.9% for the year.

International concerns

A long list of other worries continues to hang over global markets, including increasing tensions between much of Europe and Russia following the invasion of Ukraine. A controversial plan to cut taxes by the U.K. government also sent bond markets spinning recently on fears it could make inflation even worse. Bond markets calmed a bit only after the Bank of England pledged mid-week to buy however many U.K. government bonds are needed to bring yields back down.

The stunning and swift rise of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, meanwhile, raises the risk of creating so much stress that something cracks somewhere in global markets.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI, Sept 29 (Reuters) - A string of small and mid-sized Chinese banks are following their larger peers and cutting deposit interest rates in the first broad-based move since 2015 to ease pressure on margins after successive lending rate cuts.

The cutting of rates on deposits, a key source of funding for Chinese banks, underscores the limitations of lower benchmark borrowing rates in reviving loan demand and growth in the world's second-largest economy, which is struggling for traction, analysts and bankers said.

Several Chinese city commercial banks and rural commercial lenders have cut their rates on a range of deposits this week, according to statements released on the banks' websites.

Bank of Nanjing Co Ltd (601009.SS) on Thursday lowered the interest rate for three-month deposits by 5 basis points (bps) to 1.35%, by 15 bps for one-year to 1.75% and by 20 bps for five-year deposits to 2.90%, according to a statement on its website.

The smaller lenders followed in the footsteps of some of China's biggest state-owned banks, which implemented rate cuts earlier this month. read more

That came after the central bank in August cut the one-year loan prime rate (LPR), its benchmark lending rate, by 5 bps, and lowered the five-year LPR, which influences mortgages, by a bigger margin.

However, efforts to boost credit demand to shore up the slowing economy have not delivered the desired result yet. read more

""Now banks are facing the same problem, which is that credit demand is not strong,"" said a person at a regional bank, declining to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to the media.

There's a shortage of clients to lend to, which makes controlling costs a vital issue for banks, the person added.

The country's banks extended 1.25 trillion yuan ($173.78 billion) in new yuan loans in August, below analysts' expectations, while broad credit growth slowed, according to data from the People's Bank of China.

China's economy narrowly avoided contracting in the second quarter as widespread COVID-19 lockdowns and the slumping property sector weighed on demand. Analysts said business and consumer confidence remain fragile.

Wang Yifeng, analyst from Everbright Securities Co., expects that there's room for further deposit rate cuts.

The cost of bank deposits is a bit high, as banks are more willing to absorb low-cost funding when they are struggling to lend out money, said Wang.

Wang Yudong, analyst at Minority Asset Management Co, likens the problems facing China's banks to those of manufacturers.

""If prices of finished products drop, you need to lower the prices you pay for raw materials too to protect your profitability.""

Peiqian Liu, China economist at Natwest Markets, noted the commercial banks' deposit rate cuts are part of the monetary policy transmission mechanism after the central bank cut key policy rates in August.

""This rate cut by commercial banks will help improve the profit margin slightly and is technically opening up more space for further (benchmark lending) rate cuts.""

Four of the five of China’s largest banks, except for Bank of China, reported falling net interest margins (NIMs) in the second quarter.

At the end of June, the NIM of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd (601398.SS) was 2.03%, with Agricultural Bank of China (AgBank) (601288.SS) at 2.02% and China Construction Bank Corp (601939.SS) at 2.09%.

Smaller lenders reported thinner NIMs. Bank of Beijing Co Ltd, for instance, reported a margin of 1.77% at the end of June. The NIM of Bank of Qingdao Co Ltd was 1.76%, and Bank of Shanghai reported 1.66% NIM.

BEIJING, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Chinese local governments may relax the floor on mortgage rates for first-time home buyers in some cities in phases, the central bank said on Thursday, in a bid to prop up property prices and revive a flagging engine of the world's second-largest economy.

Localities would be allowed to decide whether to maintain, lower or scrap the floor for such buyers by the end of 2022, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said in a statement on its website.

China is trying to tackle a deepening property crisis - a key drag on the economy, as home buyers refuse to make mortgage payments on unfinished buildings and developers' financial strains further hurt confidence in the sector.

In May, the central bank lowered the floor of mortgage rates for first-time home buyers to 20 basis points below the loan prime rate (LPR) with similar maturity. The five-year LPR, the benchmark reference rate for mortgages, stands at 4.30%.

For cities where the selling price of new commercial residential housing fell month-on-month and year-on-year between June and August 2022, the lower mortgage rate limit would be relaxed, the central bank said.

""The introduction of such policies and measures is conducive to supporting governments in cities to make full use of the policy toolbox to promote the steady and healthy development of the real estate market,"" the central bank said.

Banks and customers may negotiate to determine the specific interest rate of new housing loans to help reduce borrowers' debt burden and better support housing demand, the central bank added.

Of the 70 cities surveyed by China's statistics bureau, 23 saw new home prices post consecutive declines in monthly and annual terms between June and August.

Eight were second-tier cities, including Tianjin and Wuhan. The remaining 15 were third and fourth-tier cities, such as Dali in the country's southwest and Guilin in the south.

Although overall demand remained bleak, more than 200 mainly small cities have taken steps to prop up the distressed property sector after a bank deleveraging campaign that began in mid-2020 triggered bonds defaults by developers and a sales slump.

Shares in Chinese developers on Friday edged up against a weak broader market, with an index measuring mainland-listed property firms (.CSI000952) up 0.6% at 0225 GMT, while the benchmark index (.CSI300) lost 0.7%.

Analysts said the mortgage rate floor relaxation was positive for sentiment, but more stimulus measures were needed.

""We may see more local governments ease their local housing policies in coming months but a significant property sector recovery should require more policy effort and time,"" Goldman Sachs analysts said in a research note.

Bank of Nanjing Co Ltd on Thursday lowered the interest rate for three-month deposits by 5 basis points (bps) to 1.35%, by 15 bps for one-year to 1.75% and by 20 bps for five-year deposits to 2.90%, according to a statement on its website.

The smaller lenders followed in the footsteps of some of China's biggest state-owned banks, which implemented rate cuts earlier this month.

That came after the central bank in August cut the one-year loan prime rate (LPR), its benchmark lending rate, by 5 bps, and lowered the five-year LPR, which influences mortgages, by a bigger margin.

However, efforts to boost credit demand to shore up the slowing economy have not delivered the desired result yet.

""Now banks are facing the same problem, which is that credit demand is not strong,"" said a person at a regional bank, declining to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to the media.

There's a shortage of clients to lend to, which makes controlling costs a vital issue for banks, the person added.

The country's banks extended 1.25 trillion yuan ($173.78 billion) in new yuan loans in August, below analysts' expectations, while broad credit growth slowed, according to data from the People's Bank of China.

China's economy narrowly avoided contracting in the second quarter as widespread COVID-19 lockdowns and the slumping property sector weighed on demand. Analysts said business and consumer confidence remain fragile.

Wang Yifeng, analyst from Everbright Securities Co., expects that there's room for further deposit rate cuts.

The cost of bank deposits is a bit high, as banks are more willing to absorb low-cost funding when they are struggling to lend out money, said Wang.

Wang Yudong, analyst at Minority Asset Management Co, likens the problems facing China's banks to those of manufacturers.

""If prices of finished products drop, you need to lower the prices you pay for raw materials too to protect your profitability.""

Peiqian Liu, China economist at Natwest Markets, noted the commercial banks' deposit rate cuts are part of the monetary policy transmission mechanism after the central bank cut key policy rates in August.

""This rate cut by commercial banks will help improve the profit margin slightly and is technically opening up more space for further (benchmark lending) rate cuts.""

Four of the five of China’s largest banks, except for Bank of China, reported falling net interest margins (NIMs) in the second quarter.

At the end of June, the NIM of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd (601398.SS) was 2.03%, with Agricultural Bank of China (AgBank) (601288.SS) at 2.02% and China Construction Bank Corp (601939.SS) at 2.09%.

Smaller lenders reported thinner NIMs. Bank of Beijing Co Ltd, for instance, reported a margin of 1.77% at the end of June. The NIM of Bank of Qingdao Co Ltd was 1.76%, and Bank of Shanghai reported 1.66% NIM.

a5c5c89c-5254-41fa-b1f1-22a98930a406,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's central bank said on Friday it would lower the interest rate for housing provident fund loans by 0.15 percentage points for first-time home buyers from Oct. 1, suggesting an urgency for policymakers to prop up the embattled property market.

The move followed the finance ministry's tax refunding policy and the central bank and banking regulator's relaxation of a floor on mortgage rates for some first-time home buyers, part of an effort by authorities to stabilise the ailing housing market.

China last adjusted the housing provident fund interest rate in 2015.

Following the rate cut, the 5-year-and-below interest rate for first-time buyers borrowing from the government's housing provident fund to finance a home purchase would stay at 2.6%, while the 5-year-above rate would stand at 3.1%, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said in a statement on its website.

The interest rate of the fund for buyers' second home purchase was unchanged, the PBOC said.

""The interest rate cut for housing provident fund loans targets home buyers with rigid housing demand,"" said Yan Yuejin, research director of Shanghai-based E-house China Research and Development Institute.

""Such a move, together with the finance ministry's policy support today and the central bank's policy yesterday, are the three major stimulus measures to stabilise the property market. They will shore up the housing market in the fourth quarter remarkably.""

China is gearing up to tackle a deepening property crisis - a key drag on the world's second-largest economy, as home buyers refuse to make mortgage payments on unfinished buildings and developers' financial strains further hurt confidence in the sector.

The PBOC pledged to ""make full use of policy tools based on local conditions to support housing demand from home buyers and upgraders"" in a statement after a quarterly meeting of its monetary policy committee.

The finance ministry said on Friday that China will refund individual income tax for home buyers if they sell their homes and purchase a new one in the same city within one year after selling, effective from Saturday until the end of 2023.

The central bank said on Thursday that Chinese local governments may relax the floor on mortgage rates for first-time home buyers in some cities in phases.

052d9e29-d4cb-4c21-89c8-4a4413c49026,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s central government is allowing nearly two dozen cities to lower mortgage rates for purchases of primary residences, in a move analysts said was likely to provide only limited help for the country’s struggling housing market.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Eligible cities will be able to maintain, lower or remove the minimum interest rates set for loans that go toward primary-home purchases in their jurisdiction, according to a statement from the central bank and banking regulator late on Thursday evening Beijing time. The permission will last through year-end and the new rates can be negotiated between banks and their customers.

The new policy will apply to cities where newly constructed housing prices declined during the June-through-August period both compared with the previous three months and with the same period of 2021, according to the statement. Existing rules for second-home mortgage loans remain unchanged. Earlier on Thursday, China’s central bank vowed to accelerate usage of targeted loans to ensure delivery of delayed property projects.

“We may see more local governments ease their local housing policies in coming months, but a significant property sector recovery should require more policy effort and time,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economists Lisheng Wang, Hui Shan and Maggie Wei wrote in a report.

The more than year-long slump in the housing market has continued to drag on the economy, adding to the damage to growth and activity from Beijing’s Covid Zero policy. While the economy looks to have rebounded from the April-through-June period, when the lockdowns of Shanghai, Jilin province and other major economic hubs almost drove gross domestic product to contract, many economists are lowering their expectations for the full year.

New home prices in China’s top 70 cities dropped 0.29% in August from July and were down 2.1% from a year earlier. Downward pressure on home prices was seen across the nation last month, with the trend worst in third-tier cities, where declines accelerated.

A total of 23 cities out of the 70 largest ones in the country are eligible for the rate-cut discretion, according to a cross check by Bloomberg of the new home price figures for the given months provided by China’s National Bureau of Statistics.

None of the four largest cities -- Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou -- qualifies for the relaxation list, according to the data compiled by Bloomberg.

Prior to the policy change, Chinese banks already could cut mortgage rates to a record low of 4.1%, after the five-year loan prime rate was reduced this month to boost housing demand.

“I’m skeptical that it will have a large effect,” said Craig Botham, chief China economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics in London. “Rates and other restrictions have been eased several times already this year, with little discernible uplift to mortgage borrowing.”

It’s not the supply of credit that’s the problem, it’s the lack of confidence in the market, driven by falling prices and failing developers, compounded by a weak economic backdrop that weighs on employment and income, Botham added.

The People's Bank of China said late Thursday that cities that have recorded month-on-month and year-on-year drops in home prices between June and August can relax the floor on mortgage rates for first-time buyers."
00bf493b-f356-4793-afc2-98b3e9675726,"BEIJING (Reuters) -Chinese local governments may relax the floor on mortgage rates for first-time home buyers in some cities in phases, the central bank said on Thursday, in a bid to prop up property prices and revive a flagging engine of the world's second-largest economy.

Localities would be allowed to decide whether to maintain, lower or scrap the floor for such buyers by the end of 2022, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said in a statement on its website.

China is trying to tackle a deepening property crisis - a key drag on the economy, as home buyers refuse to make mortgage payments on unfinished buildings and developers' financial strains further hurt confidence in the sector.

In May, the central bank lowered the floor of mortgage rates for first-time home buyers to 20 basis points below the loan prime rate (LPR) with similar maturity. The five-year LPR, the benchmark reference rate for mortgages, stands at 4.30%.

For cities where the selling price of new commercial residential housing fell month-on-month and year-on-year between June and August 2022, the lower mortgage rate limit would be relaxed, the central bank said.

""The introduction of such policies and measures is conducive to supporting governments in cities to make full use of the policy toolbox to promote the steady and healthy development of the real estate market,"" the central bank said.

Banks and customers may negotiate to determine the specific interest rate of new housing loans to help reduce borrowers' debt burden and better support housing demand, the central bank added.

Of the 70 cities surveyed by China's statistics bureau, 23 saw new home prices post consecutive declines in monthly and annual terms between June and August.

Eight were second-tier cities, including Tianjin and Wuhan. The remaining 15 were third and fourth-tier cities, such as Dali in the country's southwest and Guilin in the south.

Although overall demand remained bleak, more than 200 mainly small cities have taken steps to prop up the distressed property sector after a bank deleveraging campaign that began in mid-2020 triggered bonds defaults by developers and a sales slump.

Shares in Chinese developers on Friday edged up against a weak broader market, with an index measuring mainland-listed property firms up 0.6% at 0225 GMT, while the benchmark index lost 0.7%.

Analysts said the mortgage rate floor relaxation was positive for sentiment, but more stimulus measures were needed.

""We may see more local governments ease their local housing policies in coming months but a significant property sector recovery should require more policy effort and time,"" Goldman Sachs analysts said in a research note.

b1fc89b5-f73a-4212-b8ee-00bade5c0972,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - A string of small and mid-sized Chinese banks are following their larger peers and cutting deposit interest rates in the first broad-based move since 2015 to ease pressure on margins after successive lending rate cuts.

efa54a28-4989-4e25-a03e-1fb3c0503642,"On the bright side of what has increasingly been a terrible year for stocks is that over time, history is filled with self-corrections and comebacks.

The S&P 500 has gone on to increase on average by 29% in the three years following a 20% plus decline dating back to 1950, according to data mined by Truist chief market strategist Keith Lerner. Stocks have gained 26% on average after a 20% plus fall zooming out and using a two-year timeframe.

Hang in there. (Source: Keith Lerner)

To be sure, most investors probably can't wait for it to be 2025. In the meantime, while history shows markets mean revert over time, Lerner advised that investors need to be careful at the moment as markets adjust to higher interest rates and weakening economic growth.

""Don't try to be a hero,"" Lerner said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above). “The moves have been violent. What we discussed in June and also in August, is to try to get a bit more tactical. You’re not going to get every call right, and it’s not always going to work out.”

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), S&P 500 (^GSPC), and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) are down 9.2%, 9.7%, and 10.6% over the past month, respectively, and once-hot momentum names in tech such as Netflix and Apple are being crushed as traders unwind leveraged bets amid rising interest rates.

Market sentiment has been damaged by a convergence of factors.

For one, the Federal Reserve continues on its mission to stomp out inflation by aggressively hiking interest rates. In turn, that has caused ripple effects across an array of asset markets: everything from a surging value for the U.S. dollar to mortgage rates nearing 7%.

Those crosscurrents are beginning to show up in economic data, with the Bureau of Economic Analysis saying Thursday first half Gross Domestic Product (GDP) declined.

We also recently saw a full-year profit warning from North Face owner V.F. Corp. as retailers battle the economic slowdown as well as reports of Apple (AAPL) cutting iPhone production on growth fears — prompting a headline-grabbing downgrade on the tech giant's stock by Bank of America. Furthermore, earlier this month, FedEx (FDX) shocked the market by slashing its full year guidance.

4b44d20d-7185-47e1-86e5-f281f1743acc,"The S&P 500 index traded at new intraday and closing lows for 2022 this past week. That move exacerbated oversold conditions that have been building for some time. Such oversold conditions can produce sharp but short-lived oversold rallies, which is what happened on Sept. 28.

However, the big picture is that the S&P SPX, +3.09% chart is still in a downtrend, and therefore this is still a bear market.

We recommend holding a “core” bearish position because of that, and we will trade confirmed buy signals around it, if they occur.

Since the lows for 2022 have been broken, we need to look back to the fall of 2020 to find what might be a support level. It appears that there could be support near 3550. Overhead, there is resistance in the 3720-3750 area, and then 3800 above that.

Lawrence McMillan

The two circles on the accompanying SPX chart are island reversals – a very bearish formation, which is rarely found on an index chart. Regardless, those set the tone for the current leg downward.

The most recent McMillan Volatility Band (MVB) buy signal has been stopped out (blue “B” on chart), since SPX closed back below the -4σ “modified Bollinger Band” (mBB) on Sept. 23. A new MVB buy signal will potentially set up soon.

That process is already underway. The large rally day of Sept. 28 saw SPX closed back above the -3σ Band, and that created a “classic” mBB buy signal. We do not trade those, preferring to wait for further confirmation with follow-through action in order to generate the next MVB buy signal. Today, the market is opening lower, so that confirmation may not be quickly forthcoming.

Equity-only put-call ratios continue to rise, and thus they remain on buy signals. They are in deeply oversold territory, in that they are near the tops of their charts, and are trading at heights not seen since March and April of 2020. Moreover, the total put-call ratio (all index + stock options that trade) is also now in oversold territory, as its 21-day moving average is above 0.90. All three of these ratios will generate buy signals when they roll over and begin to decline.

Lawrence McMillan

Breadth has been very poor on the most recent market decline of the past two weeks. As a result, both breadth oscillators are on sell signals and are in deeply oversold territory. Even though Sept. 28 was a “90% up day,” these oscillators are going to need at least two and maybe three more days of positive breadth to generate buy signals.

The number of new highs on the NYSE has not improved, as they are running in the low teens daily. As a result, the “New Highs vs. New Lows” indicator remains bearish as it has since last April.

VIX VIX, +1.51% is giving us some interesting signals. First, on Sept. 20, its 20-day moving average crossed above the 200-day MA, joining VIX there, and that created a Trend of VIX sell signal. It has been a strong sell signal, as was the one before it in late 2021. Both are noted by pink circles on the accompanying VIX chart.

Since this signal can be in place for quite some time, it is an intermediate-term sell signal. It would be canceled out only if VIX were to fall back below the still-rising 200-day MA of VIX, which is just above 25.

But VIX has also given us a shorter-term buy signal, as it fell back more than 3.00 points from its most recent peak (34.88), and that creates a “spike peak” buy signal. The “B’s” on the VIX chart are previous “spike peak” buy signals. A red B denotes a successful trade, while a blue B is a losing trade. One can see that this system – while quite profitable over the years – has not fared well in its last two attempts. Regardless, we are not in the business of ignoring signals, so we have taken a small long position based on this indicator.

Lawrence McMillan

The construct of volatility derivatives has turned somewhat negative in its outlook for stocks. This is the first time that this indicator has been bearish in quite a long time. The term structure of the VIX futures slopes downward now, in the first three months.

In a similar fashion, the term structure of the CBOE Volatility Indices is no longer sloping upward.

The VIX futures are beginning to trade at a discount to VIX as well. These are all bearish signs. If they worsen it could mean more short-term trouble for stocks.

In summary, we are retaining our “core” bearish position, although we did roll the strikes down on our put options, not only to capture some partial profits but also to open up more downside potential. We will trade confirmed buy signals around that “core” position. So far, we have not had any confirmed buy signals (an extremely oversold condition is not a buy signal) until just a day ago on Sept. 28. So this is still a dangerous market and with VIX in an uptrend, it is even more volatile.

New recommendation: Potential MVB buy signal

As noted above, the previous MVB buy signal was stopped out for a loss on Sept. 20. However, a new MVB buy signal is in the process of setting up. The first step is to generate a “classic” mBB buy signal, and that was accomplished on Sept. 28. The MVB buy signal will take place if SPX closes above the high of Sept. 28 – that is, above 3737.

IF SPX closes above 3737 on any day,

THEN buy 1 SPY Nov (18th) at-the-money call

And sell 1 SPY Nov (18th) call with a striking price 20 points higher

If established, this trade’s target is for SPX to trade at the upper, +4σ Band. The stop for this position would be if SPX were to close back below the -4σ Band.

New recommendation: Bristol Myers Squibb

The weighted put-call ratio in Bristol Myers Squibb BMY, +1.58% is giving a buy signal from a deeply oversold level. The last time that happened was in December of 2021, and that launched a strong rally in the stock.

IF BMY closes above 72.50,

THEN buy 3 BMY Dec (16th) 72.5 calls

BMY: 72.06

If bought, these call will be held as long as the put-call ratio buy signal is in effect.

Lawrence McMillan

Follow-up action

All stops are mental closing stops unless otherwise noted.

We are using a “standard” rolling procedure for our SPY spreads: in any vertical bull or bear spread, if the underlying hits the short strike, then roll the entire spread. That would be roll up in the case of a call bull spread, or roll down in the case of a bear put spread. Stay in the same expiration, and keep the distance between the strikes the same unless otherwise instructed.

Long 1 SPY Oct (21st) 377 put and short 1 SPY Oct (21st) 347 put: This SPY, +3.15% is our “core” bearish position. Previously, it was twice rolled down 30 points on each strike (per our general rule of “rolling” stated above). There is no longer a stop for this position at this time.

Long 6 CANO Oct (21st) 7 calls: Option volume in Cano Health CANO, +11.11% has elevated again, riding the momentum of rumors related to possible takeover interest by CVS Health CVS, +0.99% , Humana HUM, +3.14% and others. A Citi analyst recently estimated a possible takeover price as high as $14. Raise the stop to 7.25.

Long 2 BFB Oct (21st) 75 puts: We will hold these puts as long as the Brown-Forman BF.B, +2.68% put-call ratio is on a sell signal. If BFB trades at 65, then roll down to the Oct (21st) 65 puts.

Long 1 SPY Oct (28th) 406 call and short 1 SPY Oct (28th) 421 call: This spread was bought in line with the McMillan Volatility Band (MVB) buy signal of Sept. 9. It was technically stopped out on Sept. 23, when SPX closed below the -4σ Band. However, since that was a moving target, we did not have a stop order in place. Now, a new “classic” buy signal has been generated, so we are going to hold this spread. We will advise on stops weekly.

Long 6 HOLI Oct (21st) 20 calls: Set a trailing closing stop at 17.60.

Long 1 SPY Oct (28th) 391 and long 1 SPY Oct (28th) 366 put: This started out as the long 391 straddle; SPY did trade at 366 this week, so we then rolled the Oct (28th) 391 put down to the Oct (28th) 366 put. Continue to hold without a stop for now.

Long 1 SPY Oct (28th) 377 put and short 1 SPY Oct (28th) 352 put: This spread was bought in line with the trend of VIX sell signal. Stop yourself out if VIX closes below 25 for two consecutive days.

Long 1 SPY Oct (28th) 372 call and short 1 SPY Oct (28th) 387 call: This spread was bought in line with the $VIX “spike peak” buy signal, which was finally confirmed at the close of trading on Sept. 27. Stop yourself out if VIX closes above 34.88 (the highest price that it has reached recently).

Bloomberg

(Bloomberg) -- China’s central bank vowed to expand a special lending program if it’s needed to ensure the delivery of delayed housing projects, and called on banks to provide financing support for this effort.

Most Read from Bloomberg

China will roll out city-specific property policies to support demand, implement special loans dedicated to ensuring property completion and increase its magnitude within reason, the People’s Bank of China said in a statement Thursday. The statement summarized the decisions of the quarterly meeting of the monetary policy committee, which was chaired by Governor Yi Gang and met on Sept. 23.

The more than year-long slump in the housing market has continued to drag on the economy, adding to the damage to growth and activity from the Covid Zero policy. While the economy looks to have rebounded from the April-June period, when the lockdowns of Shanghai, Jilin province and other major economic hubs almost drove gross domestic product to contract, many economists are lowering their expectations for the full year.

“The fourth quarter is a critical time to make progress on construction resumption,” said Chen Wenjing, associate research director at China Index Holdings. “If the macro economy stabilizes and supportive measures get implemented well, the housing sales slump this year may narrow to about 20% in a sign of stabilization.”

China’s housing ministry has yet to provide details about the national bailout fund announced in August, although Bloomberg reported earlier that the lending program will be 200 billion yuan ($27.8 billion). The People’s Bank of China and the Ministry of Finance will channel the money through policy banks such as China Development Bank and Agricultural Development Bank of China, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg earlier.

The special loans will only be used on homes that have already been sold but are yet to be finished, the people said. Still, it remains unclear how much of the special loans have been allocated.

In the statement on Thursday, the PBOC said it will guide commercial banks to provide funding support to safeguard the interests of homebuyers and support the healthy development of the housing market.

China’s home sales slump has persisted despite additional easing measures from local governments, as the nation grapples with a job crisis and weak economic recovery. Boycotts have “battered” homebuyers’ confidence, the chairman of the second-largest developer China Vanke Co. warned last month, adding that a recovery will only be “mild and slow.”

The central bank also said it would make full use of policy bank financing tools, with an emphasis on supporting infrastructure development. The PBOC vowed to let the market-driven deposit interest rate adjustment mechanism play an important role in pushing borrowing costs lower.

The PBOC will also “enhance the stability of credit growth and ensure that the pace of increase in the money supply and total social financing basically match that of nominal economic growth,” the statement said. “We will further smooth the transmission mechanism of monetary policy and maintain liquidity at a reasonably ample level.”

On the currency the bank promised to strengthen expectation management and keep the yuan’s exchange rate “basically” stable at a reasonable and equilibrium level. On Wednesday the bank issued a strong verbal warning on the currency, cautioning against speculation in currency markets after the yuan weakened below 7.2 to the dollar to a 14-year low.

China will continue to push for regulated, healthy and sustained development of the platform economy which refers to tech giants, and practice normalized oversight over the sector, the PBOC statement said.

0c48b5cc-f289-4d10-972c-5b2295e24b65,"SHANGHAI: Chinese developer stocks and bonds rallied after a report that the nation’s financial regulators told the biggest state-owned banks to provide financing worth at least US$85bil (RM395bil) to the battered property sector.

A Bloomberg Intelligence gauge of real estate stocks jumped as much as 2.6% before paring gains.

Cifi Holdings Group Co, KWG Group Holdings Ltd and Agile Group Holdings Ltd were the top gainers in Hong Kong, up more than 7% each.

Meanwhile, higher-rated developer US dollar bonds rebounded, with some notes snapping a two-week losing streak.

The People’s Bank of China and the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission recently told the six largest banks to each offer at least 100 billion yuan (US$14bil or RM65bil) of financing support including mortgages, loans to developers and purchases of their bonds, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News.

Mainland markets are closed this week for a holiday.

The move would be the latest in a series of actions intended to arrest a property slump that’s been weighing on the world’s second-largest economy for more than a year.

Chinese policymakers have already encouraged local governments to ease curbs on home-buying and asked lenders to meet reasonable financing needs of developers.

“We believe this adds weight to the long list of ongoing easing measures for the property sector and suggests the worst time of property tightening is likely behind us,” Citigroup analysts, including Judy Zhang, said in a note.

The move is also positive for lenders such as China Merchants Bank Co, helping ease some worry over their credit risk, according to Citi.

The big banks are unlikely to be forced to lend to the most troubled developers, Zhang wrote.

Among other measures, China also unveiled a rare tax incentive for home-buyers last Friday, while the nation’s central bank lowered interest rates on housing provident fund loans for first-home buyers.

Calls for industry support have gathered pace in recent weeks ahead of the twice-a-decade Communist Party congress later this month.

Steven Leung, executive director at UOB Kay Hian Ltd said: “The market is focused on the party congress later this month and policies on the property market will be the most important to judge on whether this crisis is coming to an end.

“The size of the loan is big compared to the level in the first half, which is vital and helps developer cash flow.” — Bloomberg"

LONDON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Interventions in the last week have helped calm panicking markets but the actions taken by the Bank of Japan and Bank of England are ""not yet credible nor coordinated"", Bank of America said in a note on Friday.

BofA analysts also said their 'Bull & Bear' indicator, which seeks to track market trends, remains unchanged at ""extreme bearish"" level.

With government borrowing costs soaring despite aggressive central bank rate hikes, and inflation rampaging, investors have fled risk assets in the past couple of weeks, given the mounting chances of global recession.

Yet equity funds recorded $7.6 billion of inflows in the week to Wednesday, while weekly outflows from bonds totalled $13.7 billion, BofA said, citing EPFR data.

Gold saw outflows totalling $1.4 billion, the 14th straight week of declines and the longest consecutive streak since January 2014.

Selling of UK equities is on track for its worst-ever year, BofA said.

Outflows from investment grade, high yield and emerging market debt stood at $13.7 billion, the highest in 13 weeks.

Today's newsletter is by Jared Blikre, a reporter focused on the markets on Yahoo Finance. Follow him on Twitter @SPYJared.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rallied Wednesday — putting in its best showing in two months — on the back of a massive, risk-on reversal in global bond and currency markets.

The U.S. 10-year yield Treasury (^TNX) plummeted the most since the Global Financial Crisis, while the U.S. dollar index (DX-Y.NYB) fell the most since the 2020 pandemic bear market.

This released tremendous pent-up pressure in financial markets, at least temporarily.

The Bank of England catalyzed those moves early Wednesday morning when it intervened to prop up its flailing bond market. The 30-year gilt yield was knocking on 5% — a key resistance level dating back to the late 1990s. Meanwhile, pension funds were reportedly facing massive margin calls that threatened their solvency, as the U.K. bond market listed toward a disorderly unwind.

That could theoretically be the best news of the year for struggling investors if these reversals indeed have legs and a declining dollar relieves investors and companies feeling the extreme pinch.

More realistically, the U.K. backstop may be a bellwether for more central bank intervention — which means the latest pause in market carnage might just be a respite before the next major crisis.

At the end of the day, British monetary authorities wilted in the face of tremendous social and market pressure. Meanwhile, the pound is still down 25% on the year versus the dollar.

It's not just the Bank of England; central banks around globe have embarked on historic undertakings. Those interventions include a surprise 100 basis points rate hike by the Swedish Riksbank; the Bank of Japan's unexpected move to strengthen the yen; and the Federal Reserve signaling more tightening into 2023 than investors expected.

Story continues

The Bank of England's action on Wednesday was even bolder, as it committed to buy an unlimited amount of bonds into Oct. 14 — all during an extant, historic tightening cycle. While authorities aren't calling the strategy ""quantitative easing,"" buying bonds is what global central bankers have been doing since the Global Financial Crisis (more or less) to stimulate risk markets.

If the U.K. appears to be engaging in two distinct, opposing monetary experiments, that's because it likely is — all in the name of expediency.

And it's that short-term time preference that might be keeping Wall Street up at night. The thought of monetary authorities simply ""winging it"" while simultaneously creating and destroying trillions of dollars — often overnight — does not sit well on the Street where uncertainty pays a high price.

A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan.

Amid all the chaos in British bond markets, the forced intervention by the Bank of England to buy gilts has given some investors a crumb of comfort about the limits of central bank tightening.

The bad news was that the BoE's extraordinary move to buy long-term gilts in a ""whatever it takes"" operation on Wednesday - postponing for at least a month its planned ""quantitative tightening"" bond sale plan, and all while it's raising interest rates - was rooted in a market malfunction that threatened the stability of the UK pension fund industry and mortgage market.

If, as many believe, central banks will tighten credit to get across inflation until something breaks, then some see this week's UK moment as a note of caution for all major central banks about the limits of tightening. Cold comfort maybe, but enough to drag bond yields back and lift stocks briefly around the world.

Others assume this is an idiosyncratic British event, with recessionary implications that have seen the UK yield curve between 2 years and 30 years invert this week for the first time since the banking crash of 2008. While 30-year gilt yields steadied just below 4% on Thursday after their 100bp swoon the previous day, the pound was sliding again and UK midcap stocks dropped.

The calm is clearly fragile. UK Prime Minister Liz Truss and her ministers stressed on Thursday the government will not reverse the economic plan for slashing taxes into the inflation surge, a plan that sparked the gilt market turmoil and sent the pound into tailspin since last Friday. read more read more

eb634a36-b425-4559-afc7-4021030d1f2c,"EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Greg Daco breaks down the recession indicators across American and European markets, the Fed's economic and employment challenges amid inflation, and supply-demand rebalances.

Video Transcript

SEANA SMITH: Investors debating whether the economy still has room for a soft landing or if we're heading into a recession. Here to break down where things are in his assessment of the economy, we want to bring in Greg Daco, EY Parthenon chief economist. Greg, it's great to see you. So certainly markets have reacted negatively to this latest rate hike. We're looking at losses. Once again today, the Dow staying under 30,000, pretty close to 29,000. S&P making a new close-- new closing low for the year. What do you think? Is there still a chance of a soft landing?

GREG DACO: I think the chances of a soft landing are really small right now. We are looking at a US economy that is slowing under the weight of persistently elevated inflation where we're seeing increased business uncertainty as to investment and hiring decisions. And as I think about the outlook for 2023, I think the odds are fairly high that we will end up in a recession. This comes in the context of an environment where the global economy is also slowing at quite a rapid pace and where policy and political developments are making the outlook for 2023 even more uncertain.

SEANA SMITH: Greg, how deep of a risk of a recession are you expecting?

GREG DACO: Well, that's the big question on everyone's mind, is no longer whether we see a slowdown in economic activity or not, but whether we see a deep one and a prolonged one. If we look at US fundamentals in terms of household finances, they still look relatively healthy. We have elevated levels of excess savings. We have elevated levels of wealth. We have low levels of leverage overall. But these are all increasing.

So from a starting point, the position of households in the US is stronger than in prior recessions. The corporate sector is a little bit less healthy, but still not unhealthy as a starting point for this potential recession. So those are positive signs, but I think we have to keep in mind that we're in an unusual environment where all central banks are tightening in a synchronized manner, but in an uncoordinated manner. And this combined tightening of monetary policy around the world will have consequences that I'm not sure everyone is capturing at this point.

Story continues

RACHELLE AKUFFO: And so when you look at, obviously, what the Fed is looking at is backwards looking when you look at some of the CPI data-- and there was concern that perhaps you should sort of wait and sort of see how these things are impacting the real economy before continuing to be so aggressive. What's your take on that?

GREG DACO: Well, I think all central banks and all policymakers right now are convinced that they need to regain control over inflation. They were all a bit late to the game in terms of tightening monetary policy in the face of what has become persistently elevated inflation. And they want to regain control over the inflation and the inflation narrative. And in doing so, they will want to tighten monetary policy quite aggressively, continue doing so, even if that entails some pain in the form of higher unemployment rate, and as Powell said, it below potential trend growth.

That means, essentially, that the Fed and other central banks are looking for a significant cooling of demand, a significant tightening of financial conditions. And they won't back down at the first signs of an economic slowdown. If anything, that slowdown is what they want to see to hope for lower inflation. So I think the bar next year for rate cuts is actually quite high on the Fed front. And for other central banks, including in Europe, the question is a little bit different, given that the economic backdrop is weaker and given that we are likely to face a fairly difficult winter on the energy front in Europe.

SEANA SMITH: Greg, let's talk about some of the consequences of the Fed tightening unemployment, right? The Fed has a 4.4% unemployment projection for 2023. How high do you see unemployment potentially going?

GREG DACO: I think it's very possible that we could see a five hand on the unemployment rate by the middle of next year. If we look at how the environment in terms of the labor market is evolving, we know that businesses and business executives have a different view of talent post-pandemic. They view talent as much more valuable because it's less available and because it costs more. But we are starting to see more strategic decisions being made in terms of reducing the pace of hiring, in terms of strategic layoffs.

I think that as we fast forward six months into 2023, we're going to be in an environment where job growth will have slowed quite significantly, where we might have seen a couple of negative job prints, and where the unemployment rate will be trending higher. So I think 4.4% by the end of next year, which is the Fed's forecast for the unemployment rate, may be even on the conservative side. I wouldn't be surprised to see the unemployment rate rising towards 5% by the middle of next year.

RACHELLE AKUFFO: And Greg, Fed Chair Powell did indicate that he is keeping an eye on international developments, of course, what other central banks are doing. Obviously, the energy crisis in Europe and so forth. And then, of course, you have this issue with the strong dollar. What are your expectations there? When do you expect to see perhaps that cool? And what sort of domino effects are you still expecting to see in the economy if this persists?

GREG DACO: I think you're absolutely right to point out that the global landscape is making the current headache of policy making even more damaging because we are in an environment where the global landscape in terms of economic activity in Europe, in Asia, is cooling more significantly than in the US. We're seeing political developments in Europe with the Italian elections just now. We're seeing developments in the UK with the mini budget and the risk of that putting higher pressure on inflation and leading potentially to a currency crisis.

All of these troubles that we're seeing around the world will wash up on US shores and affect economic activity in the US, also affect morale and confidence, which is already depressed. So we have to be conscious of the fact that what happens in the rest of the world does not stay outside of the US. It will have an effect on economic activity.

I think to that extent, Powell is right to highlight that they will be monitoring international developments. I'm a little bit less optimistic in terms of the view of the global economy going into 2023. I think we risk a recession that is more pronounced that's currently priced in. And that is a downside risk for the US economy going into next year.

SEANA SMITH: Greg, let's also talk about consumers. Certainly, consumers have been pretty resilient so far in this economic slowdown that we have been seeing. Now we're seeing a slowing in housing, mortgage rates above 6%. What's your assessment of just how consumers are feeling right now?

GREG DACO: Well, consumers are not feeling good. I mean, we see it in the confidence readings that are near all-time lows in terms of sentiment readings, for instance. We have an environment where inflation is not just elevated, but it's broad-based. It's affecting most every sector that consumers are in. And it's been persistent. It's been lasting for quite a bit of time. So households across the US are facing this significant pinch.

And they're noticing that while they're spending more, they're buying less. And that is really a key concern, as we move into next year. Interest rate sensitive sectors like the housing sector are also feeling the pain, with mortgage rates approaching 7%. That is a big, big hit for potential home buyers. And that will mean even reduced activity on top of slower consumer spending.

RACHELLE AKUFFO: And sticking with the consumer, in terms of where we are with supply and demand, are we seeing any sort of leveling off at this point, any sort of parity coming in now?

GREG DACO: We are in some sectors. We are starting to see this delicate rebalancing act taking place. And as you correctly note, one of the big issues right now is that there are a number of sectors that are still imbalanced. As we look into next year, we're going to see more of that rebalancing taking place. But any rebalancing is rarely smooth. Usually, what happens is that you have an overshoot on one side of the ledger or on the other. In the current environment, we're seeing some easing supply pressures, but we're also seeing demand that is cooling.

So both sides of the ledgers are being worked on by the Fed and by economic conditions overall. And so this rebalancing effect will likely take more than just a couple more months. It's probably going to take a year or 18 months before it actually levels out. So I think we are going to be in an environment where we're going to have to learn to navigate this macroeconomic uncertainty. And for businesses, this really requires focusing on resilience, building resilience on the talent front, building resilience on the organizational front, on the supply front, to ensure that they are able to navigate this period of uncertainty.

RACHELLE AKUFFO: That certainly sounds like a holistic approach needed, indeed. A big thank you to Greg Daco there. Thank you for joining us this afternoon."
9394dffb-712f-4afb-893c-be7f03bc2942,"Thematic Markets' Marvin Barth joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss news that the Bank of England will purchase bonds, the course of Fed policy in the U.S., and the outlook for global demand and economies.

Video Transcript

AKIKO FUJITA: For a deeper dive on the dynamics impacting the global currency market, we've got Marvin Barth, Thematic Markets founder. Marvin, great to have you on a day like today to try to make sense of all of this.

MARVIN BARTH: Pleasure.

AKIKO FUJITA: Let's go back to what we got from the Bank of England today buying up long-dated UK debt until October 14 in their words to restore orderly market conditions. Is this move going to be enough?

MARVIN BARTH: Well, it depends what you mean by enough. It is certainly providing some stability here. I think one of the things that led to the further sell off on Monday was a sense that policymakers in the UK were not really taking this seriously after a historic sell off on Friday. They've come out. They've addressed this very directly.

Remember, by the way, this doesn't actually necessarily create money, right, because you're taking with one hand, and you're giving back with another since banks can deposit funds and actually have an incentive too because they're being paid interest. And lots of people are actually borrowing those funds and creating new money. You're not actually creating new money, right? So all this is doing is providing what the Bank of England said that it was trying to do, which is to stabilize a market that had started to seem a little bit disorderly.

AKIKO FUJITA: So this, of course, comes at a time when we've seen central banks around the world really starting to tighten their policy. The Bank of England still has remained intact in terms of their target here of shedding 80 billion pounds off their balance sheet annually. Can they keep that target intact given the volatility that we've seen over the last few days and the policy shifts, quite frankly, coming from the government?

Story continues

MARVIN BARTH: Well, so the-- there's a really interesting thing going on here, which is that central banks all over the world are facing both supply and demand shocks. And the way you want to address a supply shock if you get a negative supply shock that's setting up prices is you don't necessarily want to fight it with higher interest rates. You actually want to accommodate it because that rise in commodity price is actually going to kill demand in the future.

If it's a demand-led shock, then you do need to address it. Now, in the US, it's very clearly much more demand-led shock. It's also a supply shock but mostly a demand shock. And that's why the Fed is leading the way here. But that, of course, puts lots of pressure on all these other central banks.

The Bank of Japan is looking at this and saying, look, we don't have a demand shock. We've got a supply shock. That's, why they didn't raise rates and instead, have had to intervene in the currency market. It is actually this interaction across central banks and the difference in the shocks that each country is facing that's creating a lot of these stresses.

And so how the Bank of England responds to this is how much of this is demand and how much of this is supply? I tend to be a bit more bullish on the demand inside for UK. So I do think that they are going to have to continue to tighten policy to address this. But there's a lot of people who think this is pure supply and that this is folly for them to raise rates.

AKIKO FUJITA: And while there's been so much focus on the Sterling this week, Marvin, as we've been watching the dollar really closely, we've seen significant pullbacks in the euro, in the yen. A lot of that driven by dollar strength. You've done some interesting research here that you say really points to why we have seen the dollar run up so much. Watch your feed this year because I think it's interesting to talk about the innovation investment you've highlighted.

MARVIN BARTH: Yeah, so there's this really interesting feature of the dollar going back historically. If you look at a long-- very long-term chart of it since the dollar was floated in 1973, you see these big, huge, almost sine wave-like cycles. And it lasted about 17 years. And so I did some research to try and identify what's driving this because that actually hasn't been a big mystery in international finance. Nobody's ever actually solved that.

And what I seem to have found is that it's associated with innovation revolutions that take place in the US and propagate out into the rest of the world. And if it starts in the US, it lead to a CapEx boom in the US drawing in capital, driving up the dollar. As that completes itself in the US, it then-- the innovation spreads to the rest of the world. And now, actually the investment opportunities are elsewhere, and the dollar comes down.

What's really interesting about this one is that we're seeing no signs whatsoever that this innovation revolution is seeping out into the rest of the world to the same extent that it has in the past. And as a result, the dollar boom is just far more powerful. And I don't see the end of it anytime soon. It will end at some point, but I can't see it from here.

AKIKO FUJITA: What will it take for that cycle to break?

MARVIN BARTH: So ultimately what has to happen is you have to start to see the return opportunities in other economies on a broad basis come up because they too start participating in this localization process that's taking place in the US. What's really behind this particular innovation wave is the idea that we can actually get rid of all this outsource globalization because now, we can actually use robots to do everything locally.

And so what you've seen is an actual shift in investment back to the United States. Given that the US was sort of the center of globalization for the global economy for the last 30 years, that's a real problem for all those economies out there that were dependent on globalization. And that's why it's difficult for me to see that transition to them-- what they actually need to have the ability to adopt that model. And I don't see any signs that they are.

AKIKO FUJITA: Finally, Marvin, I wonder if you can give us some historical context. You are right in the thick of central bank policymaking during the Asian financial crisis back in S There's a lot of people who are saying, well, what we're seeing right now with currencies kind of reminds me of the '90s. Obviously, that was over in Asia. We saw the collapse of the Thai baht pulled, led to the pullback of other currencies too. Are there parallels to be drawn here?

MARVIN BARTH: Yeah, there's a significant parallel to be drawn. Remember at that time, what was going on is we had the previous innovation revolution taking place in the US, right? The internet 1.0 and the expansion of productivity that occurred with that. And so it was the US was basically sucking capital out of the rest of the world. Well, if you were dependent on foreign capital as happened in a lot of those Asian economies, that created all sorts of balance of payments problems that were exacerbated by fixed exchange rates.

The good news this time is we don't have fixed exchange rates. But what that does mean is that it is exacerbating the supply shock as those currencies fall in terms of increasing inflation or the prices of commodities in these economies. And at the same time, they're also having to compete with higher and higher US interest rates. So it's still creating a lot of pressure. And it's still going to create a lot of the volatility that we've seen in the last week across economies. But at least we're not dealing with broken exchange rate plans.

AKIKO FUJITA: OK, we'll take that, and we'll take the one silver nugget there that we can take. Marvin Barth, Thematic Markets founder. I appreciate your time today."

7dc38aa1-e1d4-4d17-bb76-70ef8681b28e,"More than one-fifth of Australian mortgage holders are considered “at risk” of missing repayments or otherwise struggling to get by as interest rate rises continue to bite.

New Roy Morgan research this week showed 854,000 borrowers were at risk of mortgage stress in the three months to July.

Following two more rises to the cash rate, that number is now estimated to be about 942,000 people.

Roy Morgan considers borrowers to be “at risk” of mortgage stress if their repayments are greater than a certain percentage of their household income, which varies according to income and spending.

They’re considered “extremely at risk” if even the “interest only” portion of their loan is over a certain proportion of household income.

The 854,000 borrowers in July considered to be “at risk” encompasses the three interest rate rises by the Reserve Bank since May.

During the pandemic, the cash rate was paused at a record-low 0.1 per cent.

But, since COVID-related measures including lockdowns have eased, the RBA has resumed adjusting the cash rate.

It was first increased by 0.25 per cent in May, before four consecutive rises of 0.5 per cent brought it to 2.35 per cent.

Economists are predicting further rises as global factors, including the war in Ukraine, contribute to a higher cost of living.

Roy Morgan’s analysis suggests that, if the RBA lifts the cash rate by 0.5 per cent in both October and November, 1.1 million Australians would be classified as being at risk of mortgage stress.

That would be an increase of 246,000 since July.

It would also be the most mortgage holders classified as “at risk” in almost a decade.

Roy Morgan’s CEO Michele Levine said 171,000 people were currently considered “at risk” since last year’s lockdown in NSW and Victoria.

“Of more concern is the rise in those mortgage-holders considered ‘extremely at risk’, now estimated at 620,000 (14.1 per cent) in September 2022 - the highest since May 2019, before anyone had even heard of the coronavirus or COVID-19,” Levine said.

“It’s important to consider that interest rates are but one variable that determines whether a mortgage holder is considered ‘at risk’. The variable that has the largest impact on whether a borrower falls into the ‘at risk’ category is related to household income – which is directly related to employment.

“These figures suggest that as long as employment levels remain strong, the number of mortgage-holders considered ‘at risk’ will not increase to anywhere near the levels experienced during the Global Financial Crisis in 2007-08-09 when well over 30 per cent of mortgage-holders were considered ‘at risk’ - including a peak of 35.6 per cent in May 2008.”

Three of the big four banks are expecting a 0.5 per cent increase to the cash rate on Tuesday.

The outlier, the Commonwealth Bank, is predicting a 0.25 per cent increase.

If the majority is correct, the average Australian borrower would pay about $160 more per month on their repayments.

Monthly repayments would increase by another $165 - roughly - if another 0.5 per cent increase was made in November.

RBA Governor Philip Lowe earlier said there would be further hikes to the cash rate in 2022 but they would not be as severe as in recent months.

“The board expects to increase interest rates further over the months ahead, but it is not on a pre-set path,” Lowe said.

“The size and timing of future interest rate increases will be guided by the incoming data and the board’s assessment of the outlook for inflation and the labour market.

“The board is committed to doing what is necessary to ensure that inflation in Australia returns to target over time.”"

Brokers warned that homeowners face a second week of mayhem as lenders try to get to grips with market expectations of soaring interest rates.

The typical cost of a two-year fixed home loan has risen to 5.75 per cent, up from 4.74 per cent on September 23, the day of Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng’s announcement.

This is more than double the 2.34 per cent average rate on offer last December, according to analysts at Moneyfacts.

Mortgage rates have risen by nearly a whole percentage point in the ten days since the mini-Budget, figures showed today

Meanwhile, the price of a five-year fixed rate mortgage deal shot up to 5.48 per cent today from an average of 4.75 per cent on the day of the mini-Budget.

Panic swept the property market last week amid concerns the Bank of England would hike its base rate to 6 per cent next year.

Lenders pulled nearly 2,000 mortgage products last week as they scrambled to reprice their deals to reflect future interest rate rises.

Some, including Virgin Money and HSBC, cautiously returned to the market at the end of last week – but with inflated rates.

NatWest announced on Sunday that it was increasing its fixed-rate deals by up to 1.78 percentage points.

According to Bank of England data, more than two million homeowners with fixed-term loans will remortgage between now and the end of 2024. They face paying thousands more when budgets have already been battered.

Yesterday the Chancellor announced he was performing a U-turn on his most controversial policy, cutting the 45p rate of income tax.

Brokers reportedly fielded inquiries from clients asking if they could pull mortgage applications submitted over the past week.

Experts said borrowers were wrongly hoping that the Chancellor’s U-turn could spark lenders to lower their rates over the next few weeks.

Dominik Lipnicki of Your Mortgage Solutions said: ‘The Chancellor’s decision yester - day was a political one which will have little effect on the City. People are still very much stressed and panicked as they are starting to understand they are facing a huge shock in their mortgage bills which is unavoidable at this point.’

The rate rise is likely to put the brakes on property sales, said Dominic Agace, chief executive of estate agency Winkworth. ‘It’s what happens every time there is a step-up in mortgage rates’, he told the Financial Times.

He added that the slowdown would be more acute in areas of the market where sales peaked during the pandemic, such as large country homes.

On the first day of last month 3,890 mortgage products were for sale. That crashed to around 2,000 and yesterday the figure stood at 2,262.

Rachel Springall, a finance expert at Moneyfacts, said: ‘Borrowers may be concerned to see a further fall in mort - gage availability but many lenders have been very vocal that their withdrawals are on a temporary basis amid interest rate uncertainty.

‘Seeking advice from an independent broker would be wise, especially for those borrowers who have not yet started the mortgage process and are deterred from the level of choice and much higher mortgage rates than they were perhaps anticipating.

‘The next few weeks will be crucial to see where lenders go from here, but we have already seen some new fixed deals arrive since last week.'"

House prices 'could fall by up to 15% next year' as markets rattled by Mini-Budget

House prices could fall by up to 15% if interest rates keep rising, experts have warned.

Analysts think house prices could drop because would-be homebuyers struggle to afford property due to higher interest rates, rising inflation and the risk of recession.

Experts think the Bank of England could raise base rate from 2.25% to 6% next year, as the central bank battles against high inflation - currently 10.1%.

A top Bank of England official warned millions of borrowers to brace themselves for a “significant” rate hike.

Huw Pill, the Bank’s chief economist, also admitted: “We don’t know what the future holds. Not for the next few weeks, not for the next few days – or even perhaps not for the next few hours.”

Base rate is factored in to the cost of financial deals like mortgages.

If base rate goes up, tracker mortgage prices go up almost straight away, as do new fixed rate mortgage costs.

Another worry for lenders is the rapidly falling value of gilts - which affect fixed-rate mortgage prices.

Lenders are withdrawing or tweaking some of their deals to reprice them, but also to avoid lending to customers who may not be able to pay their loans back if costs rise.

Credit Suisse is warning that house prices could ""easily collapse by ten to 15%"" if borrowing costs continue to rise.

Andrew Garthwaite at Credit Suisse said: ""The 8% decline in sterling since August 1 should add a further 1.3% to near-term inflation.

""On current swap rates, the average mortgage will be 6.3%. House prices could easily fall 10% to 15%.""

Andrew Wishart, senior property economist at consultants Capital Economics, said: “At the current level of house prices, an increase in mortgage rates to 6.6% would cause the cost of repayments on a new mortgage to rise to their highest level since 1990.”

He also predicted the hit to affordability would trigger a bigger fall in house prices than the 7% it had forecast.

If Bank of England base rate does hit 6% next year, the average two-year fixed rate mortgage would see monthly repayments jump to £1,490, from £863 now.

The list of lenders pulling or tweaking deals so far is:

Halifax

Santander

Virgin Money

Skipton Building Society

Clydesdale Bank

Scottish Building Society

Leek United Building Society

Nottingham Building Society

Bank of Ireland

Paragon Bank

Darlington Building Society

More are likely to follow.

The Skipton Building Society said it had withdrawn its offers for new customers, in order to “reprice” given the market movement in recent days.

Virgin Money said: “Given market conditions we have temporarily withdrawn Virgin Money mortgage products for new business customers.

“Existing applications already submitted will be processed as normal and we’ll continue to offer our product transfer range for existing customers.

“We expect to launch a new product range later this week.”

Halifax also said it is withdrawing all mortgages that come with a fee."

I wrote about the action of central bankers last week, suggesting that the rapid increase in interest rates, led by the U.S. Federal Reserve, would lead to a meaningful break in financial markets, whether at home or abroad sometime soon. Well, it appears that day has come. related investing news Top JPMorgan stock strategist says the bear market lows are likely to be retested soon On Wednesday, the Bank of England, the historical model on whose practices modern central banking is based, intervened in the British bond market, reportedly, to prevent spiking ""gilt"" yields from sinking certain British pension funds. (Gilts are British bonds that are named for the gold-edged paper on which they were once printed.) Unbeknownst to many of us, some British pension funds, which in total hold about $1.7 trillion in assets, used derivatives both to hedge a rise in interest rates but also to amplify gains coming from certain kinds of trades. In other words, pension funds used borrowed money to speculate in financial markets. As rates shot up, some of those trades collapsed in value, creating margin calls on those self-same funds, triggering a near-Lehman moment in U.K. financial markets. The BoE stepped in and bought bonds, driving long-term yields down by over a full percentage point, and pushed U.S. 10-year yields down as well. That led to a reflex market rally in Europe and the U.S. Wednesday, which was all but erased a mere 24 hours later.

'An even bigger break' ahead

We are on the cusp of an even bigger break in the global financial architecture as Federal Reserve officials are now doubling down on the need to raise rates to fight what appears to be falling inflation, irrespective of the consequences. Some Fed officials admitted that rates will continue to rise even amid a recession and that rate hikes won't stop until inflation falls to its stated target of 2%. Whether that means raising rates above the current perceived target of 4.6%, or keeping rates up for an extended period, remains unclear. What is clear is something I have suggested for quite some time — that recession is a feature, not a bug, of Fed policy, echoing the policy decisions of the late Paul Volcker who in the early 1980s drove interest rates to 20% to induce an inflation-killing recession and tame inflation that had been raging for over a decade.

watch now

I have argued that the chosen historical analog is the wrong one to use as a guide to current policy. For the historical record, while Volcker's draconian policies were successful in taming inflation, they also came with an associated and unanticipated cost even beyond the deep double-dip recession that ensued. Rapidly rising rates in the U.S. put a strain on Latin American nations which had borrowed considerable amounts of money from U.S. commercial banks throughout the 1970s. Those debts, largely denominated in dollars, were hammered by a combination of higher rates and falling domestic currency values, effectively and substantially increasing the debt service burden on those nations. As rates rose sharply, Latin American nations threatened to default on their outstanding debts, an event that could have rendered many U.S. money center banks, effectively, insolvent. Volcker had no choice but to stop raising rates and start cutting them to relieve the strains on the U.S. banking system. So, even under those circumstances the Fed raised rates until something broke. They would do that again in 1987 (October stock market crash), in 1994 (Mexican peso crisis and Orange County bankruptcy) and would try in 1997 and 1998, but were stopped by the Asian currency crisis and the Russian debt default and subsequent, and massive, failure of Long-Term Capital Management. LTCM was a hedge fund that used so much borrowed money from U.S. banks to speculate on international bonds that its collapse threatened the solvency of the entire U.S. financial system.

Volatility Spikes As The Quarter Ends

Another tough week for the markets as the Fed continued its “tough talk” on the inflation front. As we noted last week:

“Such leaves the markets in a very tenuous position. However, in the short-term, markets are testing this year’s lows and are sufficiently oversold to provide a relief rally. However, there is little to get excited about that until the Fed stops hiking rates aggressively and stops reducing its balance sheet.”

On Friday, the market took out the June lows but is testing support going back to the peaks in 2020. As noted, every technical indicator is now screaming oversold. As shown by the vertical lines, when the market had previously hit such lows across indicators, such was typically near a short-term bottom. We suspect that as we enter into October, we could see a more sustainable reflexive rally to roughly 3850 on the S&P 500. Investors should continue to use such rallies to raise cash and rebalance risk accordingly.

So far, the Federal Reserve has remained blessed with a very stable market environment. However, on Wednesday, the Bank of England started buying bonds as the U.K. pension system faced potential insolvency from surging margin calls. Investors should not overlook the importance of those actions. Such was the subject of an article I wrote for MarketWatch. The crux of the article was the combined impact of tighter monetary policy combined with a surging dollar and rates was the recipe for “financial instability.”

“Furthermore, the surge in the dollar, driven by higher rates, accompanied the sharpest increase in interest rates in history. That’s problematic, particularly in heavily indebted economies, as debt-servicing requirements and borrowing costs surge. Interest rates alone can destabilize an economy, but when combined with a surging dollar and inflation, the risks of market instability increase markedly.”

That article may be very timely, as noted by Charles Gasparino on Twitter:

SCOOP (1/2): @federalreserve officials getting increasingly worried about ""financial stability"" as opposed to inflation as higher rates begin to crush bonds, several big investors tell me. Fed growing worried about possible ""Lehman Moment"" w a 4% FF rate as Bonds and derivatives — Charles Gasparino (@CGasparino) September 30, 2022

The risk of market instability is rising, as seen in the volatility spike this past week. While that volatility spike remains subdued, it has reached the warning zone, suggesting something may be near breaking in the markets.

We will continue to watch volatility closely. In the meantime, both markets and sentiment are at such bearish levels the risk-reward is now favorable for traders. We will review the daily, weekly, and monthly charts for what we expect could happen next.

Technical Levels Suggestive Of A Reflexive Rally

While the recent volatility spike is concerning, it is essential to put the market into some perspective. As bearish sentiment increases, it is easy to get trapped in negative psychology during the decline. However, as Bob Farrell once stated, “investors tend to buy the most at the top and the least at the bottom.”

When analyzing the market, we use different time frames for understanding market risk and trends. The daily chart of the S&P 500 index above confirms the adverse price action weighing on investors.

However, with the market trading 3-standard deviations below the 50-dma, such has previously preceded a reflexive rally in the market. Furthermore, as discussed in “The Big Short Squeeze:”

“Currently, everyone is once again bearish. CNBC is again streaming “Markets In Turmoil” banners, and individuals are running for cover. Our composite investor sentiment index is back to near “Financial Crisis” lows. We agree investors should be more cautious in their portfolio allocations. However, such is a point where investors make the most mistakes. Emotions make them want to sell. However, from a contrarian view, such is the time you need to avoid that impulse.”

Another contrarian indicator we noted was the number of S&P 500 stocks on bullish “buy” signals. With just 11.6% of stocks on bullish buy signals, such has historically denoted a short-term market bottom at a minimum.

Lastly, the more extreme deviation from the 225-day moving average suggests a short-term bottom. While deviations are more extreme during recessionary periods, the market is currently 15% below its moving average. Such extremes tend to precede short-term reversals and intermediate-term rallies, even in ongoing bear markets.

While it is certainly easy to be extremely negative on the market, given recent market action, it is almost always better not to “panic sell” market lows. The market will allow you to exit positions at better prices, don’t try to outsmart the market.

Market Review – Weekly Chart

For investors, the outlook remains concerning. However, on an intermediate-term basis, the market is very oversold, which suggests a reflexive rally is likely. As shown, over the last 22 years, there are only three occasions where the market was 2- or 3-standard deviations below the 50-week moving average. Furthermore, there are only a handful of periods where the weekly Stochastic and Williams %R indicators were at such extreme lows.

Each of these more extreme lows also coincided with volatility spikes that preceded either an early market-bottoming process or a reflexive rally. While this time could certainly be different, it is worth giving history the benefit of the doubt.

Since weekly charts move slower, this does not mean the markets will rally immediately. Long-term charts indicate that volatility spikes will likely continue, and investors should monitor their risk accordingly. Just as momentum-driven bull markets can defy logic longer than many expect, bear markets work just the same.

The chart below shows the price deviation from the one-year weekly moving average. Given the negative deviation is at one of the lower historical levels, such also suggests a reflexive rally is likely.

A longer-term monthly view suggests the market still has more downside risk.

Long-Term View Is Bearish

The monthly chart of the S&P 500 remains problematic. Notably, long-term charts predict long-term outcomes. They are NOT SUITABLE for trading portfolios short-term. So caution is advised.

However, over the last 22 years, extreme deviations above the 24-month moving average have always led to “mean reverting” events. During the “Dot.com Crash,” the market retested its long-term mean. During the “Financial Crisis,” the market made a complete reversion pushing into 3-standard deviations below the mean. The market exhibits the same extreme oversold conditions as in 2002 and 2008. However, the market has yet to retrace to its 24-month moving average, which currently resides around 3000 on the index. While the market doesn’t need to retest that long-term mean to make a bottom, moving averages are a magnet for prices.

We see the same problematic setup when viewing the market’s current deviation from its 2-year monthly moving average. The depth of the current deviation has only occurred 4-times since 1960. Previously, such led to a deeper correction over the next several months. (Some are worse than others.)

Given the more extreme oversold condition daily, weekly, and monthly, we continue to expect a reflexive rally. Interestingly, we were saying the same thing near the June lows, just before the 17% rally into August. We expect a retracement to 3900-4000 on the S&P 500 index will be a suitable level to rebalance portfolio risks heading into next year.

Notably, valuations, interest rates, and economic indicators suggest lower asset prices in 2023, mainly if, as expected, a recession occurs. Just as it was in February 2021 when I discussed these same technical deviations:

While valuations and long-term deviations suggest problems for the markets ahead, such can remain the case for quite some time. It is this long lead time that always leads investors to believe “this time is different.”

It is the same in bear markets, only in reverse.

So, understanding that markets are deeply oversold on multiple levels, we feel there is a reasonable risk-reward ratio to the markets currently. As I noted last week, depending on your time horizon, there are two current ways to approach the market.

Short-Term Traders can add to beaten-down equities and look for sector rotations opportunistically. Our SimpleVisor.com “Relative Analysis” page can help you find oversold sectors and equities and provide tradeable opportunities. Real Estate is hugely oversold relative to Healthcare; however, Real Estate has an interest rate problem. Therefore, we would probably look to Technology for a risk-on tradeable bounce.

If we look at the top-10 holdings of the Technology sector, we see several companies oversold relative to the sector itself and present tradeable opportunities to explore.

Long-Term Investors should use any rally to reduce portfolio risk and raise cash levels for now. As noted, markets are oversold enough for a tradeable rally back to the 50-dma, and while the market could rally further, don’t try and time the exit. Sell into the rally as it proceeds. When the rally eventually reverses, you will have reduced risk accordingly. We expect to see lower lows before the final market bottom, coinciding with a significant volatility spike and reversal of Fed policy.

As noted last week, the Fed funds futures market has priced in the Fed’s likely “terminal rate” on monetary policy going into 2023. We moved our cash holdings into short-term treasuries as we see no near-term catalysts to deploy that cash into equities. We made no changes to portfolios this past week but will be raising cash holdings on the next rally.

Short- and long-term investors should continue to follow the risk management rules.

Re-evaluate overall portfolio exposures.

Bonds are Historically Cheap

The scatter plot below from Fidelity plots weekly levels of the ten-year UST yield and 5×5 inflation expectations. 5×5 inflation expectations are the implied five-year inflation rate bond traders expect five years from now. The current 5×5 rate is 2.28%. As a comparison, the next five-year implied inflation rate is 2.18%. The graph shows the current ten-year yield of 3.68% is 1.33% above the 2.35% trend line rate.

Fidelity took the analysis further and compared the ten-year rate to the five-year implied inflation rate average and the 5×5 inflation rate. This method captures yields versus the full ten-year of inflation expectations. Since 2010, on average, the Treasury note was 0.21% abovU.K.e aggregate expected inflation rate. Currently, it is 1.40% above it. Both methods show that bond yields are over 1% too high based on inflation expectations. Bottom line: bonds are a buy. However, many financial undercurrents, such as the U.K. pension fund selling, are unpredictable and, in some cases, unknown. These events can create significant volatility and temporarily increase yields further.

SimpleVisor Top & Bottom Performers By Sector

SimpleVisor Asset Class Trend Analysis

Relative Performance Analysis

Last week, we stated:

The Fed’s “no pivot” policy pushed assets further into oversold conditions. Historically, when every sector and market is oversold, counter-trend rallies are highly probable. Use that rally to sell into.

Unfortunately, with the end of the quarter Pension Fund rebalancing last week, the markets didn’t muster a rally as the selling pressure into the weekend caused a volatility spike. Again, this week, with every sector deviated well below respective moving averages and deeply oversold, a rally into October will be an excellent opportunity to rebalance risk.

Technical Composite

The technical overbought/sold gauge comprises several price indicators (RSI, Williams %R, etc.), measured using “weekly” closing price data. Readings above “80” are considered overbought, and below “20” are oversold. Markets tend to peak when readings are at 80 or above, which suggests profit taking and risk management are prudent. The best buying opportunities exist when readings are 20 or below.

The current reading is 13.17 out of a possible 100 and rising. Remain long equities for now.

Portfolio Positioning “Fear / Greed” Gauge

The “Fear/Greed” gauge is how individual and professional investors are “positioning” themselves in the market based on their equity exposure. From a contrarian position, the higher the allocation to equities, to more likely the market is closer to a correction than not. The gauge uses weekly closing data.

NOTE: The Fear/Greed Index measures risk from 0 to 100. It is a rarity that it reaches levels above 90. The current reading is 21.22 out of a possible 100.

Sector Model Analysis & Risk Ranges

How To Read This Table

The table compares the relative performance of each sector and market to the S&P 500 index.

“M/A XVER” is determined by whether the short-term weekly moving average crosses positively or negatively with the long-term weekly moving average.

The risk range is a function of the month-end closing price and the “beta” of the sector or market. (Ranges reset on the 1st of each month)

The table shows the price deviation above and below the weekly moving averages.

The selling pressure continued this week, taking almost every sector and market into double-digit deviations below long-term weekly moving averages. Such extremes are not sustainable, and when all markets and sectors are this oversold, a reflexive rally becomes highly probable. Every sector, except Energy, is well below monthly ranges.

The calm that settled on global markets after the Bank of England’s unprecedented intervention to shore up U.K. bonds seems to be fading, with stocks in the red as a risk-averse mood builds for Thursday.

It’s hard to find a big money manager who isn’t worried out there, amid fears of the Fed “breaking something” as inflation soars and Europe’s energy crisis worsens.

With central banks — the BoE being a current exception — no longer providing liquidity support to markets, investors now need to be more nimble if they hope to preserve their capital, or even wring some alpha out of their portfolios.

That’s the message from Stock Traders Daily and portfolio manager at Equity Logic, Thomas H. Kee Jr., who in our call of the day says they must learn or relearn one vital skill to survive these turbulent times.

“Unfortunately, many in today’s market have completely forgotten how to manage risk, and over the past decade the FOMC has dissuaded Wall Street from being concerned about risk,” Kee said in a recent post, which he discussed with MarketWatch in an interview.

In short, some investors have mastered the art of not managing risk at all, said Kee. And managing risk has been a core part of his Stock Traders Daily strategies from the internet bubble’s peak through during a decade of stimulus. Since 2000, he notes, “some of the most opportune times have come during times of widespread fear in the market.”

At its heart, risk management “both reduces the temptations that come with greed, and the stress that comes with the fear cycles,” letting investing flow through economic and market upheaval, said Kee.

So how to not be at the mercy of markets and fear? For starters, forget about that buy and hold strategy, said the portfolio manager, who has long used a strategy of alternating between cash and the highly liquid SPDR S&P 500 ETF SPY.

He highlights his Stock of the Week strategy as an option for retail investors, who can be more nimble than the bigger institutions that have too much money to move around.

“The approach is to trade one stock every week, according to a trading plan that is designed to go with the expected flow of the market in the week ahead. The correlation factor is important, but the risk controls involved in the trading plans are traditional. They are normal stop losses, but what is not normal is that this strategy also ends every week in cash,” explains Kee.

That means investors can take a “nap” from market exposure over the weekend, as the strategy objective is to trade one stock every week, and end every week in

cash.

And using turbulent environments to an investor’s advantage has also worked for him when it comes to one cornerstone stock. Kee bought Apple AAPL in May, then sold it in near the highs in mid-August along with Invesco QQQ QQQ, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index, in mid-August.

He has been back buying Apple, which had a rough day on Wednesday amid reports of slowing demand for its newest models.

He says investors need to look for stocks that can “withstand good and bad times,” he said. “Apple is a bellwether and you don’t want to mess with lower quality stocks in conditions like this,” he said, adding that because of its quality, the stock can be held for a month or two.

The bank doesn't expect the bleeding to stop until the Fed launches a coordinated dovish pivot with other central banks.

""Markets stop panicking when central banks start panicking but BoJ/BoE panics not yet credible nor coordinated,"" BofA said.

It's been a tough year for investors, with global stock and bond markets erasing $46.1 trillion in market value since November 2021, according to Bank of America.

The massive drawdown has led to forced liquidations on Wall Street, the bank's chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett said in a Friday note, highlighting the recent break below 2018 support in the NYSE Composite Index.

And investors shouldn't expect the pain to stop until the Federal Reserve, in coordination with other central banks, pivots away from its currently hawkish monetary policy and towards a more dovish stance, according to the note.

That's because this year's interest rate and quantitative tightening shock from the Fed has hit Wall Street's ""addiction to liquidity,"" Hartnett said.

And while the Bank of England and Bank of Japan have recently pivoted to a more dovish stance amid turmoil in their local currency and fixed income markets, that hasn't been enough, as evidenced by the continued downtrend in stock prices.

""Markets stop panicking when central banks start panicking but BoJ/BoE panics not yet credible nor coordinated,"" Hartnett said, referencing the fact that the Bank of England's recent easing measures, combined with the UK government's tax cut plans, runs counter to its goal of reducing elevated inflation.

As to when such a panic by central banks might occur, Hartnett believes mid-November is a possibility, arguing that the S&P 500 could fall another 10% from current levels by then, which would ""force policy panic"" right when the G20 meets on November 16.

Such a policy shift from central banks would help spark a short-term relief rally, but the stock market likely won't find its ultimate low until the first quarter of next year when recession and credit shocks lead to a peak in interest rates and the US dollar, Hartnett said.

To take advantage of such a decline, Hartnett recommends investors ""nibble"" if the S&P 500 hits 3,600, ""bite"" if it falls to 3,300, and ""gorge"" if the index touches 3,000, which would represent a peak-to-trough decline of 37.5% from its January peak.

Based on historical data, the S&P 500 has experienced 20 bear markets over its lifetime, with a average peak-to-trough decline of 37.3%, which would be right in line with 3,000 for the S&P 500."
3fa4bab1-47b4-4e59-b62c-7c579fc0aff1,"For the G-7 nations, comprising Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US, the average 10-year yield is approaching a key inflection point.

At about 3.15 per cent, it’s already well above the mean of 1.3 per cent seen in the past decade. And if the Bank of Japan wasn’t spending billions of yen to keep its benchmark yield below 0.25 per cent, that average would be even higher.

Sky-high inflation

The current elevated level of consumer prices, which has belatedly spurred central banks into raising official interest rates, bodes ill for bond yields. After years of keeping inflation below their 2 per cent targets, the guardians of monetary stability have been caught napping at the wheel.

The current G-7 average of 7.2 per cent is way beyond the two-decade mean of 1.7 per cent, the one-decade level of 1.6 per cent or the 2002-2012 average of 1.8 per cent.

Sky-high inflation suggests central banks will need to tighten policy even further in the coming months to subdue consumer prices. The G-7 average official interest rate is at about 1.75 per cent (although, again, Japan’s suppressed borrowing cost distorts the figures somewhat), after hovering around zero in the past two years. That doesn’t seem sufficiently high to bring prices back into line.

We haven’t even begun to address the impact high and rising borrowing costs will have on stocks. While equities floated to records on borrowing costs that were around – and below – zero, the best advice now is probably: “Don’t look down.”

The total global equity market capitalisation is currently about $US90 trillion (about $140 trillion); while that’s 47 per cent higher than when the pandemic locked down economies in the first quarter of 2020, it’s 25 per cent below its November peak.

“I used to think that if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the President or the pope or a .400 baseball hitter. But now I want to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everybody,” James Carville, a political consultant to President Bill Clinton, told the Wall Street Journal in 1993.

The bond market has certainly been intimidating the world this year. The test in the coming days, weeks and months will be whether that G-7 average breaches the 3.5 per cent mean that prevailed between 2002 and 2012, or declines closer to its two-decade level of about 2.4 per cent. But it seems safe to say that we won’t revisit the 1.3 per cent average of the past decade any time soon.

c17ca70c-86e0-44c2-a36f-a3396e858a2e,"The third quarter is a officially a wrap, and the stock market saw the Dow (^DJI) post its worst September performance in two decades — down nearly 2800 points, or 8.9% for the month — while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) are now in the red three straight quarters for the first time since the Global Financial Crisis.

And as investors prepare for the historically volatile (and crash-prone) month of October, some on Wall Street are coalescing around the idea that equities are on the cusp of a meaningful rally. Two key questions remain: How far can stocks rally? And, is ""The low"" in?

The global research team at BofA Securities, led by Michael Hartnett, has navigated the curveballs thrown by 2022 far better than most. In their latest missive, Hartnett & Co. reflect on the ""broken, freaky post-[Quantitative Easing] financial system plumbing"" and throw down the gauntlet at the bottom-is-in crowd.

""We are tactical bears,"" says BofA, recommending bets on lower stock prices and higher yields (particularly in the two-year tenor) into Halloween.

This image of U.S. dollars flowing through pipes was created by Yahoo Finance with DALL·E AI software. (OpenAI)

They cite the recent actions by the Bank of Japan and Bank of England as evidence that central bankers are enacting ad hoc policy responses doomed to fail. Moves in London were particularly dizzying: British authorities aggressively hiked rates to combat inflation (restrictive), then proposed cutting taxes to mitigate the pain on the working class (stimulative), and then — in the face of pension funds teetering on the brink of collapse — committed to buy an unlimited amount of bonds for a period (also stimulative).

The situation may not be as dire in the U.S., but cracks are surfacing that reveal financial markets are creaking under the strains of massive and often incongruous policy responses.

Central banks have tightened financial conditions to the point where the plumbing of the global financial markets could burst, BofA stated, having already drained $3.1 trillion from their balance sheets through quantitative tightening (QT).

Story continues

BofA:

Investors, meanwhile, are grappling with a generational shakeup in market regime, which necessarily takes time and patience to navigate. BofA painted a stark picture of the dramatic transition.

The ""bullish deflationary era of peace, globalization, fiscal discipline, QE, zero rates, low taxes, [and] inequality"" is slowly giving way to an ""inflationary era of war, nationalism, fiscal panic, QT, high rates, high taxes, [and] inclusion,"" the analysts wrote.

At the same time, authorities must respond to day-to-day realities — oftentimes without the luxury of waiting. BofA believes that global authorities are likely to come together and coordinate policy if the carnage continues into a critical G20 meeting in mid-November.

Until then, BofA sees the S&P 500 plunging further to the numerically-symmetrical target of 3333. Rounding to the nearest hundred, their advice is to ""nibble 3600, bite 3300, gorge 3000."" The S&P 500 closed at 3585.62 Friday — a fresh 2022 low — suggesting a light snack of bruised large-cap stocks for those champing at the bit to deploy cash on the sidelines.

Looking forward to 2023, BofA expects the ""Big Low"" in the first quarter as recession and credit shocks peak. From there, the bank is forecasting the ""trade of '23"" to be short the dollar while being long emerging markets, small caps, and cyclical stocks.

BofA stressed that investors shouldn't expect to achieve anything near the historic annual returns of 10% — much less the 14% returns achieved over the trailing decade — and simply be aware of ""more limited upside from risk assets.""

After what is shaping up to be a remarkably turbulent year for investors, perhaps ""limited upside"" will be a welcome change in 2023.

d127a4f1-8f50-4762-a529-7515eea80526,"Global investment-grade bonds are suffering their worst selloff in at least three decades based on the year-to-date yield spike of the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Bond Total Return Index.

As a gauge of the carnage, the iShares Core Global Aggregate exchange-traded fund, which tracks the global bond benchmark consisting of government, corporate and other types of fixed-income debt denominated in 28 local currencies, has fallen 21.5% year-to-date, according to FactSet data, which is the steepest percentage decline since at least 2017.

Looking another way, Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, a London-based strategist at JP Morgan Chase & Co. characterized the 2.5 percentage point increase in the yield of the global aggregate index in the past nine months (see chart) as “the steepest and largest rise in the history of the Index,” in a recent research note. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.

JP MORGAN

The global aggregate bond index dates back to the early 1990s, and originally was known as the Lehman Brothers Global Aggregate Bond Total Return Index.

The scope of its move this year has been even larger than the surge in global yields that occurred in 1994, the same year that the Federal Reserve hiked the fed-funds rate by 75 basis points in a single shot in November of that year. This marked the last time the Fed raised rates by such a large margin after a single meeting before June of this year.

The Fed has since hiked rates by 75 basis points three times this year following its meetings in June, July and September.

Furthermore, it has been the worst selloff in the global bond market since at least the early 1980s, including Gennadiy Goldberg, a senior U.S. rates strategist with TD Securities.

“It’s difficult to compare directly, but this is already the fastest move in interest rates since at least 1981,” Goldberg said. Inflation and rapidly rising interest rates can spell disaster for bonds investors, since bonds that offer lower yields often decline in price.

Furthermore, the performance of the global aggregate index based on an “unhedged” basis, which doesn’t adjust for the strength of the dollar, makes the loss even more severe, said Panigirtzoglou, who leads a team of analysts specializing in cross-asset research.

Taken in purely dollar terms, the global aggregate bond index has unwound more than a decade of returns in the span of just nine months, he said, with the following chart showing the steep drop from above $500 billion.

JP MORGAN

The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.31% , a gauge of the greenback’s strength against a basket of its main rivals, advanced to its highest level in 20 years this month, spurred by weakness in the euro EURUSD, +0.29% , pound GBPUSD, +0.54% and Japanese yen USDJPY, -1.15% , among other currencies.

As the global bond rout intensified this week, the 10-year Treasury yield rose more than 5 basis points to 3.7594% on Wednesday. The yield briefly topped 4% earlier this week for the first time since 2008. The nearly 2.5 percentage-point increase in the 10-year yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 3.641% so far this year represents the biggest year-to-date increase since 1981, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

As a result of the chaos in markets, the Treasury yield curve has been inverted for months, with the 2-year yield TMUBMUSD02Y, 4.351% trading at 4.184% on Thursday, up 8.6 basis points on the day.

It also has prompted nervous investors to sit on a pile of cash. As a result, nonbank investors’ bondholdings have fallen to just 17% of their overall portfolio, the lowest level relative to their holdings of equities, cash and other positions, since 2008, according to JP Morgan data.

JP Morgan

The selloff in bonds and equities since the start of the year has led Panigirtzoglou and his team to two key conclusions.

The first is that institutional investors are sitting on so much cash that it could help to buttress markets against further declines. This is a view that Panigirtzoglou and other JP Morgan analysts like Marko Kolanovic have touched upon in their research for months.

“A backdrop of high cash allocations provides in our opinion a backstop to both equities and bonds,” Panigirtzoglou said.

They also concluded that it might be difficult for equities to rally unless bonds rally as well — a view that is widely held by stock-market analysts, as rising Treasury yields have been blamed for exacerbating the selloff in stocks.

Investors around the world have been keeping a close eye on global bond markets lately, particularly after the Bank of England was forced to intervene to suppress unprecedented volatility in its local sovereign-bond market that bled across borders and even rattled U.S. stocks.

Deutsche Bank analysts pointed out a few days ago that global bonds are now in their first bear market in 76 years, based on data going back to 1786.

Exchange traded funds that track bond markets have endured a torrid time this year as galloping inflation has forced central banks to raise interest rates aggressively, in an effort to restore price stability.

Investors have been warned to expect more increases in interest rates in the US, UK and EU as increased volatility in global energy and food prices — resulting from Russia’s war in Ukraine — creates greater uncertainty over the future path for inflation.

Meanwhile, widespread losses have been registered across some of the world’s most popular fixed income ETFs. Bond prices, which move inversely to interest rates, have dropped as central banks have signalled that tighter monetary policy will be necessary until policymakers are confident that inflation has been brought under control.

As a result, the 10 largest fixed income ETFs by assets have all delivered negative total returns in the first eight months of this year: ranging from minus 3.4 per cent for SHY — BlackRock’s $26.6bn iShares 1-3 Year Treasury Bond ETF — to minus 16.1 per cent for LQD — BlackRock’s $32.9bn iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF.

The biggest ETFs in high-yield bonds and emerging market debt have also suffered significant losses by September. HYG — BlackRock’s $12.3bn iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF — has lost 14.1 per cent this year and its direct competitor JNK — State Street’s $5.9bn SPDR Bloomberg High Yield Bond ETF — has dropped 12.8 per cent. At the same time, EEM — BlackRock’s $22.6bn iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF — has fallen 18.2 per cent.

But this repricing has been accompanied by shifts in positioning by large institutional investors. Many are abandoning their earlier caution and are now more willing to allocate more funds to the asset class.

A net 40 per cent of asset allocators held “underweight” bond positions in September, according to a survey by Bank of America of 212 investment managers with combined assets of $616bn. However, that was an improvement in sentiment compared with the net 80 per cent “underweight” recorded in October 2021 — the most pessimistic reading in the 20-year history of the survey.

The risk-reward balance for bond investors has improved because of the price falls, according to Amundi, the Paris based-asset manager.

“Bonds are back,” says Vincent Mortier, group chief investment officer at Amundi. “After the great repricing in the first half of the year, and as we move to an environment with a higher risk of recession, government bonds are worth looking at as yields are now more appealing.”

Investor appetite for government bond ETFs has strengthened, accordingly. Global net inflows were $118.4bn in the first eight months of this year — already more than double the $47.1bn gathered over the whole of 2021, according to ETFGI, a London-based consultancy.

Bonds are back — government bonds are worth looking at as yields are now more appealing

“The US has been the main driver of the increased inflows into government bond ETFs this year, along with a notable improvement in Europe,” says Deborah Fuhr, chief executive of the ETFGI consultancy. “At the same time, continuing investor caution is evident across inflation-linked bond ETFs, high yield, and emerging market fixed income ETFs, which have all registered net global outflows so far this year.”

Michael John Lytle, the chief executive of Tabula, a London-based ETF provider, says sentiment toward credit that is investment grade and high yield improved following the weakness in the first half of 2022.

“Developments in bond markets in the first half were undoubtedly painful for fixed-income investors,” he acknowledges. “Although it is not clear where policy on interest rate rises will peak, spreads in both investment grade and high yield markets have widened and are now much more attractive.”

Fears of acute inflation remain a major problem for fixed-income investors, though. BlackRock says the threat that high inflation rates will persist is still being underestimated by investors. But the world’s largest asset manager thinks that both the US Federal Reserve and ECB will be forced to stop raising interest rates once the gravity of the damage being done to the economy and employment by monetary tightening becomes clearer.

BlackRock has a “neutral” tactical view on EU government bonds and an “underweight” on holding US Treasuries. It is recommending clients should overweight inflation-linked bonds and also investment-grade credit. “The strong balance sheets of high-quality corporate bond issuers suggest that investment-grade credit should weather weaker economic growth better than equities,” says Karim Chedid, head of investment strategy for iShares in the Emea region at BlackRock.

He adds that investors looking for income should also consider LEMB — BlackRock’s $373mn iShares JPMorgan EM Local Currency Bond ETF — which has an attractive yield.

“Local currency emerging market debt offers attractive valuations and income. Higher yields already reflect monetary policy tightening in emerging markets and compensation for inflation risks,” says Chedid."

Global bonds are now in their first bear market in 76 years, after having dropped 20% from their peaks, according to Deutsche Bank research dating back to 1786. The last time global bonds fared so poorly was in 1946, the year that the first session of the United Nations was held in London after the end of World War II.

Driving much of the brutal selloff in global bonds, which has sent yields soaring across developed markets, is expectations for much higher interest rates as central banks try to combat the highest inflation spell in 40 years. As financial-market players rush to factor in much higher rates, they’ve aggressively sold off government bonds — pushing yields to multiyear highs, particularly in the U.S.



Global government bonds have seen a decade’s worth of positive nominal returns wiped out, so far, based on a rolling 10-year return basis. “By the end of September 2022, this may be the worst rolling 10-year period for U.S. bonds in history,” Deutsche Bank researchers said.

“What makes this current period even worse historically is that we are now seeing deep losses in nominal terms which, for many countries, has never previously happened over a sustained period outside of wars or defaults,” said Deutsche Bank researchers Jim Reid, Henry Allen, Luke Templeman and Adrian Cox."

U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) has the potential to help Europe strengthen its energy security, according to a recent report by the American Petroleum Institute (API) and the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (IOGP).

The study, conducted by Rystad Energy, found that new long-term supplies from abundant and affordable resources could fully replace Russian natural gas and rebalance the European market.

“As Russia holds European energy supplies hostage, this study shows how critical American natural gas will be to lasting global energy security,” API Vice President of Natural Gas Markets Dustin Meyer said.

From 2021 to 2040, Europe’s demand for LNG is projected to increase 150 percent. According to the study, Europe could replace Russian imports before 2030 with abundant and affordable global natural gas resources.

U.S. LNG is being exported to Europe at record levels while reserves of natural gas have increased nearly annually since 2000. This is because of steady gains in drilling activity, production technologies and natural gas exploration.

“To harness the power of U.S. LNG, we need smart and consistent policy support here at home, including strengthening domestic pipeline networks and energy export facilities, that will ensure both American consumers and global allies have access to the reliable energy that powers our modern world,” Meyer said.

The United States would need to expand its LNG export capacity to meet shared energy security commitments with the European Union, while the European Union would need to expand its import capacity over the next several years.

To meet European demand, the United States needs timeliness and transparency in the permitting and approval process for the full natural gas and LNG value chain, and the appropriate European legal framework must support long-term LNG purchases and infrastructure contracts, the report said.

API is a standards-setting organization. IOGP Europe supports the goal of reaching climate neutrality in Europe and calls for inclusive policies."
348d2b54-b795-431b-9cdc-3772951b3525,"Seven months after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, an energy crisis continues to roil Europe. Things might only get worse from here.

In a global research note by Bank of America released Friday, analysts warned that higher storage levels of gas in Europe still might not be enough to hold the continent over in the cold months ahead.

“One winter’s storage is not a long-term solution,” the bank’s analysts wrote.

European gas inventories are above seasonal averages at 88% full, they noted. Storage levels could rise above 90% in October—which could put “pressure” on spot prices (current prices at which an asset could be bought or sold).

“Yet we caution against a false sense of security,” the analysts said.

Their reasoning? For one, full European gas inventories represent only two months of peak winter demand. Additionally, the high prices are directly responsible for higher levels of storage—so if prices decrease, storage could deteriorate.

This comes as leaks hit the Nord Stream pipelines in what both the European Union and U.S. President Joe Biden called deliberate acts. Although Russia had already cut its gas supply to Europe for some time now, reports of the leaks and the question of who’s to blame have escalated tensions.

“Whatever the cause, it raises the possibility that gas may never flow via Nord Stream again— thereby locking in our ‘ugly’ supply disruption scenario of ~€200/MWh Europe gas prices,” the analysts wrote. “This is a picture that we see persisting for several years until tangible new LNG (liquefied natural gas) supply comes to the market from 2025/26.”

Before the war, the European Union relied on Russia for 40% of its natural gas supply. Since the supply was cut off, countries throughout Europe have been working to reduce their gas and electricity consumption by placing restrictions on both businesses and consumers—all while increasing their imports of liquefied natural gas.

But the fear of what’s to come remains.

If Russia’s gas imports cease, Europe’s total gas supply for 2023 will be 25% lower than 2019 levels, even if Europe makes maximum use of its existing capacities in LNG regasification and planned ones in floating storage regasification units.

The bank’s analysts also warned that more demand deconstruction—a sustained decline prompted by a prolonged period of high prices or constrained supply—is needed as European gas demand increases 60% across colder months.

“Demand destruction to date might be balancing markets, but we highlight that a 15% reduction in summer demand is very different from -15% during winter,” they wrote. “Peak demand months are as much as double summer lulls, hence nominal demand destruction may have to rise in step in order to balance flows.”

Additionally, the bank’s analysts suggested the effects of the gas crisis will spill over into coming years, in terms of sustained higher gas prices for Europeans.

“The bottom line is that a permanent alteration in daily flows has a much greater impact than starting storage levels, which can only be consumed once.”"
87a2c0a0-4b99-471e-a28b-dcb4f04a1f0e,"Liquefied natural gas from the United States has turned into a lifebelt for struggling Europe as Russia cut supplies via one of the biggest gas conduits into the continent. U.S. LNG will continue to play a crucial role in Europe’s gas supply. But it won’t be enough to avoid a major squeeze over the next three years. A recent study by Rystad Energy and funded by the American Petroleum Institute and the International Association for Oil & Gas Producers found that U.S. producers will remain the biggest LNG suppliers to European countries over the long term. But before the market rebalances, there will be a supply gap lasting until somewhere between 2023 and 2025.

The gap will be prompted by the assumed cutoff of all Russian gas supplies—something that European countries have stated they will aim for—and growth in U.S. LNG export capacity. Meanwhile, export capacity will be growing in Qatar, too.

Although there are non-Russian options for more pipeline gas, such as Norway, Azerbaijan, and Algeria, the Rystad study assumes that LNG will reign supreme as the main source of natural gas for Europe, coming to satisfy half of its demand by 2030.

Over the next 10 years, LNG is seen covering as much as 75 percent of demand in Europe, booking an expansion of 150 percent from 2021. What the report does not seem to dwell on are the costs associated with this increased reliance on liquefied gas and their effect on European industries’ competitiveness.

Related: Oil Jumps On EIA Inventory Data

Already, the European Union’s gas import bill has swelled to ten times the usual for filling up winter storage sites because of the switch to LNG from pipeline gas. It’s worth noting that all that LNG was bought on the spot market, and Brussels has been a fan of spot markets for years. With the new gas bill, however, it might reconsider.

Indeed, some are already reconsidering: Germany’s Chancellor Olaf Scholz last week went on a tour in three Gulf states looking for hydrocarbon deals, with a focus on LNG, and the only result from the tour was an agreement with Emirati Adnoc for the delivery of one cargo of LNG of 137,000 cubic meters and a non-binding commitment for five more cargos.

Meanwhile, U.S. producers seem to be happy to sell their liquefied gas on the spot market, where it fetches prices that just a couple of years ago would have been unthinkable. Media have even reported about cases of diverting cargos of LNG meant for Asia to Europe because of the European’s willingness to pay a premium to get the gas.

While this year, such behavior is perfectly understandable as European countries scramble to stock up on gas for the winter, over the longer term, it would not exactly make economic sense.

European industries are already struggling to remain profitable amid soaring energy bills. Yet many of them are too busy fighting for survival to bother about profitability, which should sound the alarm to governments and motivate a more comprehensive diversification of gas deliveries.

Based on the Rystad research, Europe is essentially replacing one big supplier—Russia—with another big supplier—the United States—which can hardly pass for diversification.

True, Qatari LNG and LNG from Africa is also an option, but unless Europeans consent to long-term commitments, it seems Qatari gas in sufficient amounts will remain a dream. African projects, on the other hand, have yet to be fully developed, or, in the case of Nigeria, security issues need to be solved.

While all of this is certainly good news for U.S. gas producers, there’s a fly in their honey, too. There is not enough pipeline capacity to carry the gas from the shale plays to the liquefaction trains on the Gulf Coast, and permitting for new LNG capacity is a complex and lengthy process.

On top of these challenges, U.S. gas drillers are already struggling to meet both local and international demand. Although the country has enormous gas reserves, production is another matter, and right now, it’s a difficult matter because of increased gas-fired power generation at home and Europe’s mad dash for gas.

This supports Rystad’s forecast for a gas supply gap in Europe over the three years to the middle of the decade. The gap is estimated at 19 percent for next year if the Groningen gas field in the Netherlands is shut down and 12 percent if it keeps pumping. For 2024, the gap is seen at 16 percent without Groningen and 10 percent with it. Finally, in 2025, the gap will begin shrinking to 14 percent without Groningen and 8 percent with it.

The report continues to point out that after 2025 it would be relatively smooth—though probably costly—sailing for gas supplies in Europe. The question remains, however, what will Europe do over these three years?

The likeliest answer to this question is quite unpleasant because it effectively comes down to the demise of its status as an industrial power. There is not enough money in the world to keep all industries in Europe on life support for three years and keep them profitable.

TOKYO, Sept 29 (Reuters) - LNG markets in 2023 may be tighter than this year as demand may rise in China, India and other parts of Asia, the head of the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Thursday.

""We may well see that the LNG markets in 2023 will be rather tight, maybe tighter than this year,"" said Fatih Birol in remarks at the LNG Producer-Consumer Conference in Japan.

Global gas prices have surged to record levels this year, as Russia's gas supply cuts have placed enormous strain on the European and global market.

High wholesale gas prices in Europe has seen the bloc import record amounts of LNG cargoes, drawing in volumes from top importing region Asia.

Birol also added that Europe has received a substantial amount of LNG this year, with imports increasing ""by a staggering 60%"".

""One of the reasons why Europe can draw so much LNG is that China ... (saw) sluggish economic growth this year,"" he said.

""If the Chinese economy recovers ... it will be difficult for Europe to attract so much LNG.""

China's imports of LNG are on track to post their first major decline this year, as high prices and weak manufacturing due to COVID-19 lockdowns crimp demand for the super-chilled fuel.

The country became the world's top LNG buyer last year but surrendered the top spot back to Japan in the first four months of 2022.

Should Japan restart their nuclear power plants, it would free up about 10 billion cubic metres (bcm) of LNG and ""help the global LNG market,"" said Birol, without specifying a timeframe.

Birol had made similar remarks on Tuesday, saying that Japan's restart of more nuclear power plants would help ease Europe's energy supply fears during the winter as more LNG will become available to the global market.

0cca0765-ec32-4a0c-99ab-9e74730d70e2,"Traders betting against Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest have had a lucrative run this year.

Shorting the firm’s family of eight exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has turned investors a mark-to-market profit of $2.4 billion so far in 2022 – more than twice the $941 million profit they made in all of last year, per figures from data analytics firm S3 partners.

Of that gain, $492 million has been generated since mid-August, as technology stocks resumed a downslide amid renewed rate hike fears and rising bond yields.

Before the recent slump, ARK rode a summer rally that helped the speculative, beaten-down stocks that comprise much of its holdings bounce. The fleeting climb led to a temporary streak of short coverings, the closure of a short position by buying back shares that were initially borrowed to short sell, from mid-June through last month.

Since then, however, “We saw short selling once again get more active in these tech-heavy ETFs,” S3 Managing Director Ihor Dusaniwsky said in a note.

“Short sellers were actively backing up their bets as stock prices of the underlying ARK ETF holdings declined,” he added. “Short sellers were willing to keep their exposure even as stock borrow rates for their shorts almost doubled.”

Catherine Wood, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer of Ark Invest, speaks at the 2021 Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., October 19, 2021. REUTERS/David Swanson

The $882 million ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) was the most profitable of the lineup, with a return of roughly 28.7%. ARKF was down about 62% year-to-date as of Thursday’s close, according to Bloomberg data. Top holdings in the vehicle include Block (SQ), Shopify (SHOP), and Coinbase (COIN), which are down roughly 60%, 80%, and 70%, respectively, over the year.

ARK Innovation (ARKK), the firm’s flagship investment vehicle with about $8 billion in assets under management, came in third place, turning short sellers a mark-to-market profit of 27.4% on average short interest of roughly $1.4 billion. The ETF was the most shorted of the docket and was down 60% as of the end of Thursday.

Wood's trenchant stock picks made her a star portfolio manager amid the pandemic recovery after ARKK returned a whopping 150% in 2020. Since then, the firm has experienced a change of fate as speculative tech names fell out of favor among investors concerned over rising interest rates.

Story continues

The ARK founder and CEO has been a vocal opponent of recent Fed policy, insisting in a recent webcast that central banks are overdoing it.

“They’ll let something crack first,” before inflation ""unravels to something well below"" the target rate of 2%, she said.

Cathie Wood's Ark Invest is dipping back into a space SPAC, with two of the firm's funds buying up stock in Rocket Lab the past two days.

Ark's exchange-traded funds ARKQ and ARKX – which focus on autonomous technology and space exploration, respectively – bought about 729,000 shares of Rocket Lab in trades on Monday and Tuesday, the firm disclosed.

While Ark's Rocket Lab position is relatively small, worth about $3 million total, the purchases mark the first recent space SPAC stock the firm has owned since selling its position in Virgin Galactic in May 2021.

Both ETFs also have significant positions in Iridium , a satellite communications company that went public via a SPAC deal in September 2009 – over a decade before the frenzy of space SPACs.

The purchases by Wood's firm also follow Rocket Lab hosting an investor day in New York, where it gave updates on the progress of its Electron and Neutron rockets, as well as its space systems business

Rocket Lab stock was up 3% in trading on Wednesday from its previous close of $4.19 a share. Like many of its space SPAC peers, Rocket Lab shares have been hit hard of late, falling about 72% over the past 12 months."
75820a88-4ec1-412c-ac5f-64edb14117f6,"Cathie Wood’s venture career starts now.

As I reported in June, ARK Invest—the investment manager known for its aggressive bets on innovative public tech companies—had been planning to debut a crossover fund that would experiment in the private markets, and it filed initial documentation with the Securities and Exchange Commission in February.

Now it’s go time. Yesterday, ARK Invest announced that the ARK Venture Fund, which will invest in anything from early-stage startups to mega-cap corporations, is live. And it’s seeking buy-in from none other than retail investors.

Sometimes there is a discrepancy when people use the word “retail investors.” Private equity firms often use that verbage to distinguish high-net-worth LPs from their institutional LPs. But make no mistake: Wood’s fund will accept retail investors, as in the Robinhood or Interactive Brokers-esque, $500-minimum-investment kind of investor, by using the fintech platform Titan.

Buckle up, because I have a lot of thoughts about this.

First, let’s go through some of the fundamentals of this new fund:

It is an “interval fund,” meaning that, unlike a Fidelity or T. Rowe Price crossover fund, ARK Venture Fund is effectively illiquid. While ARK will repurchase about 5% of the fund’s outstanding shares every quarter, the capital is basically locked up.

The fund has “substantial risks,” per its own disclosures. For private companies, and especially early-stage ones, valuations are uncertain, failure rates are high, and liquidity is limited. You can read through ARK’s 11-page list of risks here.

The fund will primarily invest in genomic advancement, automation, energy transformation, A.I., “next generation internet”, and fintech companies.

Management fees are 2.75%. The total expense ratio is 4.22%. There is no carry.

ARK told the Wall Street Journal it is targeting a 70% allocation to private companies, and a 30% allocation to publics.

Personally, I think making this available to retail investors is a horrible idea. Yes, retail investors can be highly sophisticated (I’d argue that many of them are probably making much better investment decisions than accredited investors). Yes, retail investors deserve an opportunity to play in the markets, too. But if you, like me, aren’t worth at least $1 million and aren’t making at least $200,000 a year (meaning you qualify for accredited investor status), you probably don’t have any business investing in venture capital.

Let’s get into this.

Right off the bat, you will be paying ARK 2.75% of the assets you invest every single year. That’s really expensive. Just for context, an investor could get passive exposure to a thematic basket of Nasdaq tech stocks for 0.10% in fees, or pay the all-in expense ratio of 0.75% for Wood’s flagship ARK Innovation ETF, which backs tech companies the asset manager believes will be transformative in the public markets. Of course, there’s way more potential upside investing in a company’s early days, and ARK is picking out the companies it thinks will end up winners with much less information to go off of. In general, investing in private companies is a lot more work, so you’ll pay for that.

Early exposure is great—if the companies end up being successful. But most startups aren’t successful, meaning investors will take on a whole lot more risk, too. The investments could lose value and the portfolio companies could all go bust. I mean—90% of startups fail, and high-flying growth-stage companies are surely not immune from enormous swings in valuations, mismanagement, scandal, or ultimate failure. There’s also the matter of managing that risk, or diversification.

Traditional limited partners have a lot of money to play with. They are family offices, endowments, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, etc. This means that they can diversify well. Let’s pull up the New York State Common Retirement Fund, for example, which has $272.1 billion in assets. As of March 2022, that fund had 13% of its assets in private equity, less than half what it allocated to domestic public equities. That capital was diversified across more than 50 different private equity and venture funds.

Now let’s introduce a retail investor with, say, $50,000 of capital they feel comfortable investing in the market. Should they allocate 13% to the private markets, that would mean they have $6,500 to invest. They simply can’t diversify much with only $6,500, putting them at a disadvantage. If the individual only has $2,000, it’s even worse.

But the major issues are around liquidity. Wood’s fund is not only extremely risky—it is also illiquid. Sure, you probably shouldn’t be touching your investments all that much anyway. But should some sudden expense emerge in a retail investor’s life (i.e. a divorce, sudden layoffs, a death in the family), there is no accessing that capital. Here’s another scenario: In some bizarre situation, Wood leaves ARK and there is a leadership shakeup within the fund. An investor no longer agrees with the direction of the fund—too bad!

You could argue that retail investors already invest in startups via mutual funds at Fidelity or T. Rowe Price (their exposure to startups has been controversial as well), but investors can exit out of those investments as they see fit. Not here.

Wood, whose ETFs have suffered amid the broader tech rout, has historically seen extraordinary success investing in public equities, and she and her team have had an eye for spotting which public companies would be transformative early on, even when some on Wall Street had scoffed at ARK’s thesis. Who knows—maybe this crossover fund will end up being the best-performing fund we’ve ever seen on the private markets. That’s unlikely: The world of privates operates under a whole different set of rules, and her team is relatively new to it.

Even if the fund ends up an outlier, that doesn’t mean a retail investor should throw 50% of their investable assets in it and risk losing it all. Especially when you consider that Americans should have about $7 trillion more saved for retirement than they actually do.

Perhaps I’m just conservative with my own small pool of investable assets. I could also just be jaded from reading lawsuits filed by individuals who were late to realize the true meaning of their money being stuck in a closed-end fund somewhere. But either way, there’s plenty of places to take bold, well-informed bets on the market, and most of them don’t require that you lock up your capital with a fund manager who will use it to make extraordinarily risky bets in a highly-opaque industry for the next decade.

If you have the money to play with and want to risk it all for the sake of a fat return, that’s great. Most people don’t, and they’d be better off putting it somewhere much safer.

See you tomorrow,

Sept 28 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets from Jamie McGeever

Investors might not often pay much heed to Vladimir Lenin, but they would surely agree with the Soviet revolutionary's 1917 observation that: ""There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen.""

Take Britain, where a government budget on Friday sparked a run on the pound and gilts, accelerated the downdraft across world markets, before prompting an astonishing policy U-turn from the Bank of England on Wednesday.

The BoE - which is raising rates and had been about to start 'QT' sales of gilts back into the market - intervened in bonds, pledging to buy unlimited quantities on a ""temporary"" basis to restore order in what was effectively a broken market.

This unleashed a wave of buying across British assets - the 30-year gilt yield sank a record 100 basis points and sterling rose 1.5% - and triggered a pent-up recovery across world markets.

The relief was palpable: world stocks and the S&P 500 snapped six-day losing streaks, with the S&P 500 jumping around 2%. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which had topped 4%, plunged 25 bps in its biggest one-day fall since 2009.

chart

But how long will the relief last? Investors' faith in policymakers' credibility must surely be dented, and the underlying tightening of financial conditions from the strong dollar and high U.S. bond yields remain in place.

Then there's China. The People's Bank of China on Wednesday said FX market stabilization is its top priority after the yuan weakened to its lowest level since 2008. Its tinkering at the edges seems to have failed, so will it soon have to take more forceful action to support the yuan?

This unleashed a wave of buying across British assets - the 30-year gilt yield sank a record 100 basis points and sterling rose 1.5% - and triggered a pent-up recovery across world markets.

The relief was palpable: world stocks and the S&P 500 snapped six-day losing streaks, with the S&P 500 jumping around 2%. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which had topped 4%, plunged 25 bps in its biggest one-day fall since 2009.

But how long will the relief last? Investors' faith in policymakers' credibility must surely be dented, and the underlying tightening of financial conditions from the strong dollar and high U.S. bond yields remain in place.

Then there's China. The People's Bank of China on Wednesday said FX market stabilization is its top priority after the yuan weakened to its lowest level since 2008. Its tinkering at the edges seems to have failed, so will it soon have to take more forceful action to support the yuan?

0473465a-df39-41c0-9eb6-20278c3714b7,"The U.S. economy is mostly insulated from turmoil in UK markets, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said on Thursday, a day after the Bank of England resumed its bond-buying in an emergency move to protect pension funds from partial collapse.

“We certainly saw some movement in U.S. asset prices in response to this, but I do think this is about UK policy,” Bullard said during a conference call with reporters. “I don’t see this really impinging on the U.S. inflation or real growth developments, so this is mostly about financial markets needing to price in the volatility you are seeing in the UK.”

The pound touched an all-time low of $1.0327 on Monday and British government bonds sold off at a ferocious pace in response to tax cuts proposed by the government of new British Prime Minister Liz Truss. There are widespread fears the government’s plan will further stoke inflation and put Britain’s fiscal and monetary policy at odds with each other.

The mixed signals added another dose of volatility to world financial markets already coping with the U.S. central bank’s interest rate increases moving faster and higher than anticipated, and many other countries racing to follow suit.

Bullard added that the Fed carefully monitors the impact of global developments on U.S. financial stability. Part of the issue was the way UK pension funds were structured, he said, calling on others around the world to take heed.

“It’s certainly true that some players in global financial markets didn’t realize they were taking risks with their strategies or they downplayed the risks ... I’d encourage them all to review their strategies in the current situation.”"

(Reuters) - Federal Reserve policymakers will press ahead with raising U.S. borrowing costs to fight the corroding effects of too-high inflation, taking in stride both turmoil in global financial markets and early signs their actions are weakening the job market.

""I'm quite comfortable"" with raising interest rates to 4%-4.5% this year and 4.5%-5% next year, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told reporters after a speech at Boise State University on Thursday, adding she expects that rates will need to stay at that level for all of 2023.

Those ranges encompass what the majority of Daly's fellow policymakers wrote in their rate path projections published last week, when the Fed lifted interest rates to 3%-3.25% in what is proving to be the most aggressive round of rate hikes since the 1980s.

The Fed's steeper-than-expected policy tightening, aimed at bringing down inflation that's running at more than triple the Fed's 2% target, is expected to slow economic growth and lift unemployment. Global stock markets have tumbled, and major currencies have lost ground against the dollar.

Loretta Mester, president of the Cleveland Fed, speaking on CNBC on Thursday, offered an even more aggressive outlook on what is needed to tame inflation.

Mester said she does not see a case for slowing rate hikes right now, and in fact said she expects the central bank will need to go even further than it signaled last week.

""I probably am a little bit above that median path because I see more persistence in the inflation process,"" Mester said.

Daly addressed the turmoil in financial markets, noting that markets are ""trying to get their footing,"" with investors assessing a myriad of risks, including market dysfunction in the U.K. which prompted intervention by the Bank of England, the war in Ukraine, the damaged gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea, continued COVID lockdowns in China, and policy tightening by many central banks globally.

""What I ultimately want to know is how much have financial conditions tightened, what has this done to the global economy, how much of a headwind will that be blowing against U.S. growth, and then how does that factor in to where what we need to do in our policy,"" Daly said.

And while Daly sees some signs that U.S. labor markets are slowing - noting that firms she talks to say they are recruiting new hires with less intensity -- consumer spending remains robust.

Still, Daly said she does not believe the Fed will need to raise rates so high they will trigger a deep recession -- for now. Unemployment, at 3.7%, is low, and the labor market is still strong, she said.

But if households and businesses start expecting inflation to continue to get worse, or if supply chains don't heal as expected and goods shortages continue to push upward on prices, Daly told reporters, ""then I am prepared to do more.""

Mester said she did not see distress in U.S. financial markets that would alter the central bank's campaign to lower very high levels of inflation through interest rate hikes.

While ""no one knows for sure"" if there is a big problem lurking in the financial sector right now, ""so far, we haven't seen the kind of market dysfunction, even through what's happening in the global markets right now, we haven't seen that in the U.S. markets,"" Mester said.

Earlier Thursday, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he doesn't see U.K. market turmoil ""really impinging on the U.S. inflation or real growth developments.""

Tax cuts proposed by the government of new British Prime Minister Liz Truss touched off a drop in the value of the pound to an all-time low of $1.0327 on Monday. The drop reflects widespread fears the government's plan will further stoke inflation and put Britain's fiscal and monetary policy at odds with each other.

cd087bf4-6bf7-491e-808e-c0fe191047cf,"St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard on Thursday defended the central bank from charges its aggressive interest rate-hike policy is creating impossible conditions for foreign central banks by saying there were no surprises this year compared to other tightening cycles.

“In the earlier era, the quantitative easing era, foreign central banks said they were surprised by Fed action and they were not sure what our policy was and this was feeding back to them,” Bullard said, in a livestreamed discussion sponsored by HSBC.

“But here, I think we’ve made it clear and we’ve been forthright,” Bullard said.

This allowed foreign central banks to act in tandem and calibrate their policies, Bullard said.

“This has helped us a lot this year to limit the sorts of disorderly adjustment that might otherwise occur,” he added.

Some analysts have said the developments in the UK this week was a sign of concern about global financial stability.

The Bank of England was forced to restart bond buying Wednesday to easing financial market jitters even though it runs counter to their efforts to fight inflation.

The St. Louis Fed president said that the Fed was always monitoring financial stability risks.

“So far, so good,” he concluded.

Pressed by reporters after his talk, Bullard said there are daily briefings at the U.S. central bank about financial stability.

Bullard noted that news reports indicate some of the volatility in the UK bond market this week was tied to pension funds using derivatives that were sensitive to large movements in bond prices.

“So I would say it is up to pension funds to take that risk into account with their trading strategy and I’m sure they will now,” he said.

“For all other parts and corners of the financial markets, they have to be careful and need to examine their strategies to make sure they are not susceptible to large movements in yields because yield are on the move, both in the U.S. and globally, and that’s because inflation has come back on the scene,” he said.

The current UK turmoil was about the kind of economic policy they want.

“I don’t see this really impinging on U.S. inflation or real growth developments,” he said.

Bullard said some of the consumer inflation reports have been a shock and surprise to central banks this year.

“I think inflation will start to come down in 2023,” Bullard said. But exactly how fast that happens and whether there are more surprises are open questions.

“It’s a fact of life, I’m afraid, in the central banking world,” Bullard said."

LONDON, Sept 29 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Liz Truss defended her economic plan that has roiled financial markets, saying on Thursday she was willing to take ""controversial"" steps to reignite growth and would not reverse course despite the turmoil.

""This is the right plan that we've set out,"" she said in a series of interviews with local BBC radio stations.

Asked if she would reverse the mini budget that shocked markets with the scale of its tax cuts and government borrowing, Truss said: ""I don't accept the premise of the question.""

""We are facing difficult economic times. I don't deny this. This is a global problem. But what is absolutely right is the UK government has stepped in and acted at this difficult time.""

Finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng sparked turmoil in financial markets last week when he delivered a plan to cut taxes without detailing the impact on the public finances or how the government would reform the economy to spur growth.

The pound sank and British government bond yields soared, forcing the Bank of England to revive its bond-buying programme in an emergency move on Wednesday to shore up pension funds. read more

Truss said the government had to take urgent and decisive action to protect households and businesses from surging energy bills.

Liz Truss has told US multinational corporations that her plan for imminent tax cuts is “just the start” of a long-term plan to simply Britain’s taxes as she tries to lure investment.

The prime minister told bosses of firms including Google, Microsoft and JPMorgan Chase that she wants “lower, simpler taxes” to attract businesses to the UK during a speech in New York on Wednesday.

Ms Truss also said Britain still has a significant number of people who are “economically inactive” following the Covid crisis – vowing that her chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng’s mini-Budget would “encourage more people to go into work”.

Confirming the plan to create low-tax investment zones in “left behind” areas, she added: “While this is just the start, our long-term plan is to simplify Britain’s taxes and to make us a better place to invest and be unashamedly pro-business.”

It comes as the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warned that Ms Truss’s radical plans for huge tax cuts alongside mammoth spending on energy bill caps could put public finances on an “unsustainable path”.

The respected think tank calculated that government borrowing would hit £100bn a year – more than double the official forecasts last March, warning that public debt was potentially on an “ever-rising path”.

The IFS said there was no case for letting debt soar “indefinitely” for the sake of immediate tax cuts, arguing that Ms Truss’s claim that her cuts would create economic growth was “a gamble at best”.

As well as reversing the hike in national insurance contributions and scrapping a planned increase in corporation tax, Mr Kwarteng is also expected to cut stamp duty at his “growth plan” mini-Budget on Friday.

IFS deputy director Carl Emmerson said: “Under the new prime minister’s plans, the fiscal targets legislated in January would be missed and while we would get to enjoy lower taxes now, ever-increasing debt would eventually prove unsustainable.”

It comes as business groups warned that further support for energy bills would be needed at the end of a “short-term fix”, after Jacob Rees-Mogg outlined his plan to slash the cost of energy costs for non-domestic users for six months.

The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) criticised the lack of detail on which kinds of “vulnerable” non-domestic customers will continue to get support beyond March. “Six months’ support is not enough to make plans for the future.”

The IFS previously estimated the cost of the business energy support package at around £40bn. The think tank said the final bill for the household energy price cap could be £100bn over the next two years, but was “highly uncertain” and could turn out to be much higher.

The national insurance and corporation tax changes would cost the Exchequer around £30bn a year, said the IFS. The economists said it would mean borrowing could hit 3.5 per cent of national income – not far off double the 1.9 per cent it averaged in the 60 years to the global crash in 2008.

“Allowing debt to rise temporarily to finance one-off packages of support, such as the energy price guarantee or the furlough scheme, in exceptional circumstances is justifiable … but the same case cannot be made for allowing debt to rise indefinitely in order to enjoy lower taxes now,” the IFS said.

The economy would have to grow by an additional 0.7 per cent a year to 2026-27 just to stabilise debt, the experts warned. “There is no miracle cure, and setting plans underpinned by the idea that headline tax cuts will deliver a sustained boost to growth is a gamble, at best,” the think tank warned.

The Liberal Democrats dubbed the Tories the “borrow and spend party” – claiming that Ms Truss’s government “has lost all sense of fiscal responsibility”.

Leader Ed Davey said Ms Truss was saying “the most extraordinary ideological things”, accusing her of leading “probably the most right-wing government in modern history”.

His party said the Conservatives were set to hand big banks a tax cut of more than £6bn over the next two years, pointing to Commons library research on the impact of freezing corporation tax.

Ms Truss has indicated that her government is willing to lift the cap on bankers’ bonuses in the City of London, despite widespread outrage among MPs, unions and economists at the proposal.

The PM told the meeting of American corporate leaders that Mr Kwarteng will be “reforming regulations” in the City and making sure new businesses are not “hit by mountains of red tape”.

She added: “We’re also going to be introducing low tax investment zones across the country, in parts that are left behind. It’s going to be easier to get things done in those zones.”

Summary Companies Truss says government will not change course on UK policy

New poll gives opposition Labour party 33-point lead

Investors warn of loss of faith in government

Kwarteng says mini budget was 'absolutely essential'

British government bond yields, sterling rise















LONDON, Sept 29 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Liz Truss said on Thursday she would stick to her controversial plan to reignite economic growth, breaking her silence after nearly a week of financial market chaos triggered by the government's push for huge tax cuts.

A day after the Bank of England resumed its bond-buying in an emergency move to protect pension funds from partial collapse, Truss blamed the upheaval on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has caused inflation to spike around the world.

""We had to take urgent action to get our economy growing, get Britain moving, and also deal with inflation, and of course, that means taking controversial and difficult decisions,"" she told BBC radio.

""But I'm prepared to do that as prime minister because what's important to me is that we get our economy moving.""

Truss, Britain's 47-year-old former foreign minister, took office on Sept. 6 after winning the governing Conservative Party's leadership contest, becoming the fourth prime minister in six turbulent years in British politics.

She defeated former finance minister Rishi Sunak by vowing to put an end to ""Treasury orthodoxy"" with a new economic policy that would cut taxes and regulation, funded by vast government borrowing to snap the economy out of years of stagnant growth.

She dismissed Sunak's warnings that her plans posed a threat to Britain's economic standing in the world as ""negative, declinist language"".

But her fiscal plan, set out by finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng on Friday, triggered a crisis of confidence in the government, hammering the value of the pound and government bond prices and jolting global markets.

Asked if the so-called mini budget had been a major economic disaster, Kwarteng told reporters the government was focussed on delivering economic growth.

""The mini budget was absolutely essential in resetting the debate around growth and focusing us on delivering much better growth outcomes,"" he said, during a visit to a local business in northern England.

Huw Pill, the Bank of England's chief economist, said on Thursday there was ""undoubtedly"" a UK-specific component to the adverse market moves, in contrast to Truss's view that they reflected global factors rather than her budget plans.

Meanwhile, a new YouGov poll showed the opposition Labour party had surged to a record 33-point lead over Truss's Conservatives. The poll of voting intention conducted over Wednesday and Thursday showed 54% support for Labour and 21% for the Conservatives.

Ken Griffin, the U.S. billionaire founder of Citadel Securities, one of the world's biggest market-making firms, said he was worried about the damage to Britain's reputation.

""It represents the first time we've seen a major developed market, in a very long time, lose confidence from investors,"" he said.

UNFUNDED TAX CUTS

Truss said her government would not change course.

Having set out 45 billion pounds of unfunded tax cuts, she said it would in the coming weeks spell out reforms of everything from childcare costs to immigration, planning and financial regulation. A fuller fiscal statement on Nov. 23 will detail the cost of the borrowing and measures to cut debt.

With borrowing costs elevated and markets volatile, investors and economists have said they cannot wait another eight weeks for details.

A committee of lawmakers in Britain's parliament urged Kwarteng to bring forward the Nov. 23 statement which will include new forecasts by the country's fiscal watchdog. read more

As well as the risk posed to pension funds, the surge in borrowing costs has led to the withdrawal of cheaper mortgage offers and a leap in corporate lending rates.

The BoE's intervention had an immediate impact in driving bond yields sharply lower on Wednesday, but investors still see the central bank increasing its key interest rate by 1.25 percentage points to 3.50% on Nov. 3, the date of its next scheduled announcement.

That rate is seen rising further to 4.50% in December and close to 6.00% by June, levels that would likely hit house prices and offset any gains from a cut in property transaction taxes that was announced last week.

Economists mostly expect a less severe pace of rate increases.

""This is the right plan,"" Truss told the BBC. Asked if it was time to reverse course, she said: ""No, it isn't.""

Yields on British government bonds rose moderately on Thursday, having plunged a day earlier on the BoE's move to temporarily buy long-dated debt and halt a sell-off that threatened the country's pension funds.

Sterling gained almost 2% against the dollar to rise above $1.10, leaving its fall in September at just under 5% and its year-to-date decline around 18%.

Simon Wolfson, the head of major British retailer Next (NXT.L), warned that the plunge would create a second cost-of-living crisis in Britain after the surge in energy costs. He cut the group's forecasts after a slowdown in August.

CRITIQUED BY MARKETS

Investors, businesses and consumers are now waiting for the government to announce more details of how it plans to get the economy growing more quickly.

""Every day, every week, every month, the government will now be critiqued by markets and businesses on how serious they are about growth and about their fiscal responsibility to pay back debt,"" Tony Danker, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said late on Wednesday.

The BoE's former governor, Mark Carney, also criticized the plan, saying the release of only a ""partial budget"", without the accompanying scrutiny from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, had unnerved investors.

Kwarteng and Truss must now try to calm nerves in the Conservative Party, which is due to start its annual conference on Sunday.

""There is no confidence in the Truss government right now,"" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote. ""The problem is not fiscal spending per se, the problem is that people just don't trust what she is doing.""

""We just avoided a bad sovereign debt crisis in the UK because the Bank of England changed dramatically its plans and jumped in.""

68e1ed81-52d2-487f-8ecc-20ea603da97f,"London: The Bank of England has unleashed a dramatic £65-billion ($109-billion) bond-buying scheme in an attempt to calm a crisis in government bond markets and prevent the financial turmoil from spreading.

The central bank made the emergency intervention, planning to spend £5-billion a day for the next 13 days, as it warned of “material risk” to UK stability and pension markets amid the chaos that has sent government borrowing costs soaring.

The value of the pound has collapsed to record lows against the US dollar and British bonds have plunged since Friday, when UK Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng unveiled his “mini” Budget involving £45 billion of debt-financed tax cuts.

The cost of government borrowing has surged, pension funds have dumped gilts and households are now braced for big increases in mortgage payments. A gilt is British pound denominated government debt issued by the British treasury."
6796a2e8-1751-4745-b1b0-d8cc094e7b49,"This has had a worrying consequence within the market itself: a clamour of margin calls on highly leveraged players in the gilt market.

Liability-driven investment funds (LDIs), backed by pension funds, were looking in real financial peril. And if they started going under, the BoE’s worry was that they could start sucking the rest of the system, and even the real economy, down with them.

LDIs are a £1.5 trillion ($2.5 trillion) corner of the pension market that works to help defined-benefit pension schemes to hedge their liabilities – pensioners’ retirement incomes – against inflation and interest rate risk.

One of the most popular LDI strategies has been to buy long-dated gilts, repo them to investors (that is, sell with an agreement to repurchase later), and use the effectively borrowed cash to buy more gilts. About two-thirds of the LDIs’ holdings are in bonds.

As the price of the long-dated bonds – the funds’ assets – began to fall precipitously, the LDIs were having to find cash to meet margin calls. They had to find more collateral to support their hedging. So, they had to sell the bonds to cut their leverage and stump up the cash.

In an illiquid market with few buyers – nobody would buy when prices looked set to keep falling and falling – these bond sales only drove the price down further.

This was creating a vicious circle of margin calls, sales, and price declines, pushing the LDIs into negative equity and threatening eventual insolvency.

By stepping in as a purchaser of the LDIs’ forced sales, the BoE isn’t just buying bonds. It is buying pension funds time to sell other assets, such as stocks, to raise cash and shore up their LDIs.

A stressful stress test

The BoE isn’t trying to target a particular yield, just steady the ship. This is why the BoE expects that it won’t need to keep buying much beyond the middle of next month, because a modicum of order and stability will have been restored.

In fact on day one, the BoE did not have to shell out as much as some had expected. It is understood they bought about £1 billion worth of gilts.

Some in the market have been asking whether there’s a whiff of 2008 about all this – hidden pockets of leverage that can metastasise into bigger and more systemic problems with frightening speed.

The BoE and the Pensions Regulator are likely to have a close look at the resilience of LDIs – ideally market-based finance would be as resilient as banks.

That said, it is hard to be resilient when your bond portfolio halves in value over a four-day period. You don’t often get a stress test quite as stressful as that."
35604312-7ceb-4baa-b024-91cbe21afc44,"""When a country sees its interest rates rise by [as much as they have] in two days at the same time that its currency is falling in a major way, that is a sign that there has been a major loss of market credibility and market confidence."
9090ff60-66bf-495a-a7e6-5a30f553bf3b,"InvestSMART’s Evan Lucas says the Bank of England moving to stabilise financial markets is in “direct movement” to what the new UK Prime Minister Liz Truss and Chancellor of the Exchequer Kwasi Kwarteng have done.

Britain’s central bank announced it would temporarily buy up UK government bonds to “restore orderly market conditions” after the pound dropped to a record low against the US dollar.

“It is an astonishing reverse from the Bank of England because they are in the current process of trying to tighten market conditions,” Mr Lucas told Sky News Australia.

“In the UK, inflation is at 9.9 per cent – it is likely to go through that double-digit sometime in the next month or so, so this is counter to what they are trying to do.”"
358f5a43-03f3-4fef-ac0e-d4c98bcf44cd,"The Bank of England has promised to take action to calm the financial market mayhem that has followed the announcement of major tax cuts by the UK government.

The Bank plans to temporarily buy whatever quantity of long-term debt is required to stabilise the cost of government borrowing, which has skyrocketed in response to Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng’s new economic plan. The difficulty is that the Bank is also expected to further raise interest rates in order to fight inflation, which will also increase the cost of borrowing, making it harder for the government to stick to its plan.

This latest intervention underlines how intertwined monetary policy – the tools used by a central bank to support a country’s economic growth – is with fiscal policy – the tools used by the government to achieve the same ends. What the government does affects what the Bank has to do and vice versa. It also indicates that either the government or the central bank must consider changing their stated course to address the current economic crisis, or risk continued financial market volatility.

Under normal circumstances, the Bank of England should set interest rates to stabilise inflation over a medium-term time horizon of around two years. When the Bank anticipates that inflation is rising, it can control that by raising interest rates to discourage consumption spending by households and investment by firms. This reduced spending on goods and services is intended to slow the rise in prices.

With the central bank acting in this way, the government is free to conduct fiscal policy in line with its objectives, provided these policies ensure that government debt remains sustainable in the long-run. That is, whatever the mix of taxation and spending chosen by the government, it must ensure that over time it raises enough tax revenues to pay for public expenditure without unsustainable increases in borrowing.

Different governments may make different choices about the size of the state (that is, how much they tax and spends on public services) and whether economic efficiency or equality should be the priority. Regardless, the books must still balance in the long run.

This conventional view relates to “normal” times, however. During the financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, when interest rates were more or less at zero, the Bank of England was forced to engage in unconventional monetary policies such as quantitative easing (printing money to buy government debt) in order to support the economy.

While giving fiscal policy a greater role in supporting the economy in such situations may be appropriate, once the situation begins to normalise the government’s tax and spending decisions should return to being sustainable.

Crisis of confidence

The recent so-called mini budget saw the government take a number of steps that reduced market confidence in its commitment to sound fiscal policy.

The removal of the permanent secretary to the Treasury, Tom Scholar, the suspension of the government’s fiscal rules, failure to accompany the mini-budget with forecasts from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, and the suggestion by Kwasi Kwarteng in a post-budget interview that more tax cuts were to come, all signalled to the markets that rising debt levels were not a concern for the government.

The government has argued that its tax cuts will “grow the economy”, increasing tax revenues to pay for improved public services. The idea is that tax cuts can motivate workers and entrepreneurs so much that tax revenues rise despite tax rates being lower.

Most economists are unconvinced that these arguments apply, generally, to the UK today, and it is unlikely that any growth will be sufficient to pay for these tax cuts. Various analyses of the mini budget suggest debt will rise as a result of Kwarteng’s measures.

Comments by organisations including the IMF, as well as economists such as Nobel prize-winner Paul Krugman and former US Treasury secretary Larry Summers, say the same thing.

Economic theory also suggests that an alternative combination of monetary and fiscal policy is viable. When the government does not make sufficient effort to raise taxes or reduce public expenditure to stabilise government debt, the central bank can soften its monetary policy, meaning it allows inflation to rise to reduce the value of excess government debt.

A large part of the reduction in debt following the second world war was achieved by a combination of low interest rates and high inflation in the 1960s and 1970s, which reduced the returns to bond holders.

But since the Bank of England was made independent in 1997, the government no longer has any control over how interest rates are set by the central bank. Revoking this independence would be seen as undesirable today, but remains a theoretical possibility.

Playing chicken

Instead, the current situation features an independent (as of 1997) Bank of England reaffirming that it will do whatever needs to be done to stabilise inflation. At the same time, the government is relaxing fiscal policy without (yet) publishing a clear plan on how the deficit will be eliminated and the growth in government debt curtailed.

This implies a game of chicken between the Bank of England and the UK government. The Bank is raising interest rates to fight inflation. This also raises the interest payable on government debt, exacerbating the deficit created by tax cuts and further increasing government debt. With UK debt levels at their highest since the second world war, one of these policy makers has to blink and change policy.

Either the Bank of England pulls back from the tightening in monetary policy needed to fight inflation and stabilise the pound, or the government acts to return fiscal policy to a more sustainable footing by at least presenting a credible plan for raising taxes or reducing expenditure.

If there is no clear resolution to this tension, we can expect further volatility in the financial markets as investors try to guess which policy maker will execute a U-turn. The Bank’s current approach of raising rates to fight inflation at the same time as buying government bonds to reduce their interest rate and support financial stability, highlights the dilemma it faces."
38874c67-97d8-4cf1-8ed6-3a38cb8097cd,"London | UK 30-year bonds headed for their biggest-ever rally after the Bank of England stepped in to stem a disorderly market rout fuelled by forced selling from pension funds.

The yield on 30-year gilts plummeted as much as 100 basis points to below 4 per cent after the BoE said it would carry out temporary purchases of long-dated debt and delay planned bond sales under quantitative tightening. That’s the largest drop in data going back to 1996 on a closing basis.

The moves injected some desperately-needed confidence into the UK’s bond market, which showed signs of collapsing in the wake of the new government’s spending plans. Frantic selling had driven the yield up more than a percentage point since Friday to as high as 5.14 per cent, a level last seen in 1998.

“We have been seeing a disorderly rise in long-end gilt and linker yields in recent days which could have driven a further uncontrolled rise if left unchecked,” said Daniela Russell, a rates strategist at HSBC. “In recent days, thousands of pension schemes have faced urgent demands for additional cash to post as collateral to meet margin calls.”

The BOE acted after being warned by investment banks and fund managers in recent days that collateral calls as soon as Wednesday afternoon could trigger a further crash in gilts, according to a person familiar with policy makers’ decision making.

The sudden spike in gilt yields was particularly worrisome for so-called liability-driven investment strategies, which are popular among UK pension programs. They often employ leverage to match liabilities -- that stretch decades into the future -- with their assets. The selloff in gilts required many to post more collateral."

The Bank of England (BoE) has been forced to stem a crisis in bond markets amid market turmoil that has sent government borrowing costs soaring.

The central bank said it will launch a temporary UK government bond-buying programme as an emergency move to stave off a ""material risk to UK financial stability"".

UK chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng’s plans to cut taxes have sent the pound to record lows and, along with expectations of an aggressive rates rises, put pension funds under pressure to sell bonds to stave off solvency.

Threadneedle Street will now start buying bonds to stabilise what it described as ""dysfunctional markets"", abandoning previous plans to sell bonds.

The Bank said in a statement: ""This repricing has become more significant in the past day — and it is particularly affecting long-dated UK government debt.

""Were dysfunction in this market to continue or worsen, there would be a material risk to UK financial stability.

""This would lead to an unwarranted tightening of financing conditions and a reduction of the flow of credit to the real economy.""

The BoE didn’t give an exact figure of how much it will purchase but said they will be carried out on ""whatever scale is necessary"", adding the Treasury would underwrite any losses.

The BoE's move follows markets' concerns over government bond markets, adding that the action would be ""strictly time limited"".

It will carry out the temporary purchases of long-dated UK government bonds from 28 September until 14 October.

The Treasury responded by reaffirming its commitment to the Bank’s independence and said the government ""will continue to work closely with the Bank in support of its financial stability and inflation objectives"".

The FPC said it ""welcomed the Bank’s plans for temporary and targeted purchases in the gilt market on financial stability grounds at an urgent pace"".

Meanwhile chief economist Huw Pill on Tuesday signalled that the Bank was ready to significantly ramp up interest rates to shore up the pound and guard against increased inflation.

""It is hard not to draw the conclusion that all this will require significant monetary policy response,"" Pill told a conference. ""We must be confident in the stability of the UK’s economic framework.""

Government bond yields have surged to a 14-year high on Wednesday, following the International Monetary Fund’s rebuke of the government’s fiscal plan, increasing government borrowing costs.

The yield, or interest rate on the benchmark 10-year gilt, rose as high as 4.56%, the highest since the financial crash in 2008, and is now trading at 4.51%. The two-year gilt climbed to 4.67%.

Liz Truss emerged for the first time in four days for a round of interviews after the government's mini-budget catapulted the British economy into financial crisis.

She appeared on eight local BBC radio stations for an hour on Thursday morning to answer a wide range of questions - from her economic strategy to her decision to lift the ban on fracking.

But if the prime minister expected an easier ride from local radio journalists, she was proved gravely wrong.

Her interrogation by regional presenters provided several excruciating on-air moments, which saw Truss at times apparently lost for words.

The awkward radio exchanges came after days of silence from the new prime minister, despite escalating economic turmoil which saw the pound drop to a record low against the dollar and the Bank of England (BoE) rescue the Treasury.

BBC Radio Leeds: 'Where have you been?'

As the segment began, Truss said it was ""great"" to be on BBC Radio Leeds, before being immediately grilled on her whereabouts while the British economy tilted on the brink of collapse.

""Since Friday, since your chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's mini-budget, the pound has dropped to a record low, the IMF [International Monetary Fund] has said that you should re-evaluate your policies, and the BoE has had to spend £65bn to prop up the markets because of what they describe as a 'material risk',"" host Rima Ahmed said.

""Where have you been?""

However, rather than responding to the question, Truss tried to deflect by immediately talking generally about the winter energy bill crisis, as the PM appeared audibly rattled by the line of questioning.

BBC Radio Bristol: 'With respect, that is the same scripted answer'

Truss later appeared on BBC Radio Bristol, where host James Hanson called out the prime minister as she tried to recycle answers about the economic crisis her mini-budget had caused.

""Prime minister, with respect, that is the same scripted answer you have given to every BBC local radio station this morning,"" said Hanson, cutting off Truss.

""You've got the BoE stepping in now to try and clean up a mess a government has caused - that has never happened!""

Prime minister Liz Truss and chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng have defended their mini-budget, which crashed parts of the economy, and said it will stimulate economic growth. (PA)

Hanson also quizzed Truss on whether people's pensions would be safe after the BoE intervened and bought over £60bn worth of government debt to avoid a collapse on pensions funds.

""Can you guarantee to my listeners this morning that their pensions are safe?""

As Truss attempted to answer by saying ""the Bank of England does a very good job"", Hanson again cut her off.

""That's not an answer prime minister,"" he said. Can you guarantee people's pensions are safe?""

Truss failed to confirm this, instead repeating the BoE ""do a very good job"" in that area.

BBC Radio Lancashire: Defends fracking... but admits she hasn't been to local fracking site

Perhaps the most excruciating moments on Thursday morning came in her interview with Graham Liver, BBC Radio Lancashire host.

Liver flagged that Truss' own MPs local to the area, including Scott Benton for Blackpool South and Mark Menzies for Fylde, have said their constituents do not support fracking - which her government lifted a ban on.

Challenging Truss on the issue of consent for fracking, Liver said: ""What does local consent look like, prime minister?""

After an awkward pause and stumbling over her words, she said the energy secretary would outline details.

However last week energy secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg refused to guarantee local consent - instead claiming ""compensation and consent"" are two sides of the same coin.

Liver continued to grill Truss, asking: ""But your local MPs don't want it, all Conservative - in the past the county council have said they didn't want it, yet your government overturned it, the science hasn't changed.

""Why can't you tell us this morning there won't be a return to fracking in Lancashire?""

Liz Truss' government made tens of billions worth of unfunded tax cuts, many for the wealthiest Brits, on Friday which made global markets panic. (Reuters)

Truss told Liver she didn't ""accept the premise"" of his question, and said: ""I don't think we should rule out the whole of Lancashire.""

Liver then pointed out that the government's claims that it worked in other countries ignored key practicalities.

""In America they do it in the middle of nowhere,"" said Liver.

""Do you actually know where Preston New Road is, where they have been fracking?"" asked Liver.

After an excruciating silence, Truss admitted: ""Well, I don't think I've been to that site in the past.""

""Shouldn't you?"" replied Liver.

BBC Radio Stoke: Lost for words when quizzed about mortgages

Appearing on BBC Radio Stoke, Truss claimed that everyone would benefit from her economic plan because it would ""grow the size of the pie"".

However she was quickly rebuffed by host, John Acres, who responded: ""By borrowing more? And putting our mortgages up?""

After an awkward silence, Truss said the government was always going to have to borrow more due to energy bills which will protect everyone.

However, she neglected to mention it was the increased borrowing to pay for tax cuts, which largely benefited the richest in the UK, that risked the British economy falling into crisis.

Acres rebuffed her claims on energy again, saying people are set to pay ""more in mortgage fees under what you've done, based on the predictions, than we would have saved with energy.""

After yet another awkward silence, she avoided the question with: ""I don't think anyone is arguing that we shouldn't have acted on energy.""

Scottish National Party (SNP) MP Tommy Sheppard described the prime minister's appearance on BBC Stoke as: ""Another car crash interview to add to this morning’s pile-up of dead air.""

Outrage in the Conservative party with Liz Truss' and Kwasi Kwarteng's mini-budget intensified on Wednesday - with one MP describing it as ""inept madness"", and a former Tory chancellor describing it as a ""catastrophic start"" amid escalating economic chaos.

Simon Hoare, who represents North Dorset, tweeted on Wednesday: ""In the words of Norman Lamont on Black Wednesday: “today has been a very difficult day”. These are not circumstances beyond the control of Govt/Treasury. They were authored there. This inept madness cannot go on.""

It comes amid a growing political backlash aimed at Truss and Kwarteng, who are being held responsible by many for plunging the UK into economic turmoil.

The Bank of England has been forced to take emergency action, buying up long-term government bonds because of a “material risk to UK financial stability”, while the International Monetary Fund (IMF) urged the chancellor to change course.

Hoare has become the first Conservative MP to make the extent of his anger amid widespread reports of serious concerns among Tory backbenches.

Some Conservative MPs are already said to have sent letters of no confidence in Truss, less than a month into her premiership.

An unnamed former minister told Sky News on Monday: ""You cannot have monetary policy and fiscal policy at loggerheads. Something has to give... They are already putting letters in as [they] think she will crash the economy.""

Under Tory party rules, 54 letters need to be sent in for a confidence vote to be triggered.

Another Tory MP and former cabinet minister, Julian Smith, reacted strongly to comments by former chief Brexit negotiator Lord Frost dismissing the concerns of the IMF.

“Arghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,” he tweeted.

Ken Clarke, former Tory chancellor and former cabinet minister under Margaret Thatcher, said: “I’ve never known a budget to cause a financial crisis immediately like this.""

He added: “They have made a catastrophic start, the budget was a serious mistake.""

The temporary measure to buy government bonds – known as gilts – to bring down spiralling borrowing costs has been met with a mixed reaction in the City.

The Bank’s extraordinary intervention, responding directly to the government’s £45 billion tax-cutting strategy, will pile further pressure on Truss and Kwarteng to defend a vision for the economy that has spooked markets and shocked most mainstream economists.

While the pound hit an all-time record low of £1.03 against the US dollar on Monday, the yield on 10-year gilts – which is a proxy for the effective interest rate on public borrowing – has also soared by the most in a five-day period since 1976, according to experts.

Senior Tory MP Roger Gale on Wednesday said: ""We need a statement in very short order indeed to steady the nerves, steady the market and set out very clearly what the business plan is so that everybody understands properly where we are going.”

The Bank of England said it was buying government bonds to bring down spiralling borrowing costs. (Getty)

On Wednesday afternoon financial secretary to the Treasury Andrew Griffith told Sky News: “We think they are the right plans because those plans make our economy competitive.”

He added: “Get on and deliver that plan. That’s what I, the chancellor and my colleagues in government are focused on is getting on and delivering that growth.""

However, the scale of the crisis in the markets has led to unease in some quarters of the Tory party, while Labour has joined calls for Parliament, currently on a conference recess, to be recalled.

“The government has clearly lost control of the economy,” Sir Keir Starmer told reporters in Liverpool.

The Labour leader said: “What the government needs to do now is recall Parliament and abandon this budget before any more damage is done.”

It all comes just days before Tory MPs and thousands of members will descend upon Birmingham for Truss’ first party conference as prime minister.

The Treasury responded by reaffirming its commitment to the Bank of England’s independence and said the government “will continue to work closely with the Bank in support of its financial stability and inflation objectives”.

The Bank's statement follows an extraordinary intervention from the IMF, who said it was “closely monitoring” developments in the UK and was in touch with the authorities, urging the chancellor to “re-evaluate the tax measures”.

It warned the current plans, including the abolition of the 45p rate of income tax for people on more than £150,000, are likely to increase inequality."

A day after the Bank of England resumed its bond-buying in an emergency move to protect pension funds from partial collapse, Truss blamed the upheaval on Russia's invasion of Ukraine that has caused inflation to spike around the world.

""We had to take urgent action to get our economy growing, get Britain moving, and also deal with inflation, and of course, that means taking controversial and difficult decisions,"" she told BBC radio.

""But I'm prepared to do that as prime minister because what's important to me is that we get our economy moving.""

Truss, Britain's 47-year-old former foreign minister, took office on September 6 after winning the governing Conservative Party's leadership contest, becoming the fourth prime minister in six turbulent years in British politics.

She defeated former finance minister Rishi Sunak by vowing to put an end to ""Treasury orthodoxy"" with a new economic policy that would cut taxes and regulation, funded by vast government borrowing to snap the economy out of years of stagnant growth.

But her fiscal plan, set out by finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng on Friday, triggered a crisis of confidence in the government, hammering the value of the pound and government bond prices and jolting global markets.

Truss said her government would not change course.

Having set out STG45 billion ($A75 billion) of unfunded tax cuts, she said it would in the coming weeks spell out reforms of everything from childcare costs to immigration, planning and financial regulation. A fuller fiscal statement on November 23 will detail the cost of the borrowing and measures to cut debt.

Investors and economists have said they cannot wait another eight weeks for details with borrowing costs elevated and markets volatile. As well as the risk posed to pension funds, the surge in borrowing costs has led to the withdrawal of cheaper mortgage offers and a leap in corporate lending rates.

The BoE's intervention had an immediate impact in driving down bond yields on Wednesday, but investors still see the central bank increasing rates by at least 1.25 percentage points to 3.5 per cent by November 3, the date of its next scheduled announcement.

Some are betting on an emergency increase before then, according to the prices of rate swaps.

Rates are seen rising further to 4.5 per cent in December and 6 per cent by June, levels that would likely hit house prices and offset any gains from a cut in property transaction taxes that was announced last week.

Economists mostly expect a less severe pace of rate increases.

""This is the right plan,"" Truss told the BBC. Asked if it was time to reverse course, she said: ""No, it isn't.""

Sterling pared some earlier losses to trade down 0.5 per cent against the dollar at $1.0797, taking its fall in September to almost 7 per cent and its fall year-to-date to almost 20 per cent.

Former BoE governor Mark Carney criticised the Truss plan, saying the release of only a ""partial budget"", without the accompanying scrutiny from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, had unnerved investors.

""It's important to have (the budget) subject to independent and, dare I say, expert scrutiny,"" Carney said.

Kwarteng and Truss must now defend their strategy, and try to calm nerves in the Conservative Party which is due to start its annual conference on Sunday."

Investors should look to avoid most stocks with recession risks rising, according to BlackRock.

The $10 trillion asset manager has warned that the Federal Reserve and other central banks have underestimated the severity of the recession that their rate hikes could trigger.

""Many central banks aren't acknowledging the extent of recession needed to rapidly reduce inflation,"" a team led by BlackRock Investment Institute head Jean Boivin said in a recent research note. ""Markets haven't priced that so we shun most stocks.""

The Fed hiked interest rates by 75 basis points for the third time in a row last week. Its tightening campaign has weighed significantly on stocks, with the benchmark S&P 500 falling 7% since August's hotter-than-expected inflation data suggested the Fed would have to carry on hiking to bring soaring prices under control.

The US central bank also indicated last week that it will raise interest rates as high as 4.6% by the end of next year, while Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged that there's a ""very high likelihood"" the US faces a period of below-trend growth.

But Boivin's team said that the Fed's cheerful economic projections overestimate the likelihood of a soft landing. In that scenario, the Fed successfully cools inflation with interest rate hikes while avoiding a severe downturn.

""The Fed still sees positive growth this year and sees it picking up next year,"" the BlackRock strategists said. ""But it also wants to see evidence core inflation is on a decisive 2% trajectory beyond 2023 before it stops hiking.""

""This soft landing doesn't add up to us,"" Boivin's team said.

The Fed wasn't the only central bank to raise interest rates last week, with the Bank of England implementing a 50-basis-point hike and Sweden's Riksbank announcing a supersized 100-basis-point hike.

The global ""rate-hike blitz"" suggests that other central bankers share the Fed's optimistic outlook, according to Boivin's team. BlackRock warned that aggressive overtightening could trigger a downturn before inflation has cooled sufficiently, leaving central banks torn between raising and slashing rates.

""Many central banks, like the Fed, are still solely focused on pressure to quickly get core inflation back to 2% without fully acknowledging how much economic pain it will take in a world shaped by production constraints,"" Boivin's team said. ""Case in point: last week's rate-hike blitz.""

""This all implies a clear sequence: overtighten policy first, significant economic damage second and then signs of inflation easing only many months later,"" the strategists added.

932cf8e8-348f-4c8b-9125-62421b111d6c,"The third quarter of 2022 is just about to wrap up. The broader market posted a muted performance during this time frame mainly due to red-hot inflation, a super-hawkish Fed and the resultant rising rate worries. Central banks around the world have been on this path in recent days to tame inflation.

The Fed has hiked interest rates this year by 300 bps so far. Last week, Fed officials raised interest rates by 75 basis points for three times in a row and Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that policymakers were ready to digest the economic recession in order to tame inflation.

The S&P 500, the Dow Jones and the Nasdaq Composite have lost about 5.6%, 6% and 6.4%, respectively, in the past three months (as of Sep 23, 2022). The small-cap index Russell 2000 has lost 4.9%.

The European Central Bank (ECB) also raised interest rates by an unprecedented 75bps in its September 2022 meeting, following a 50bps rate hike in July, and matching expectations from most analysts. The ECB promised further hikes.

Among the latest rate hikes, the Bank of England hiked its key interest rate to 2.25% from 1.75% on Thursday and said it would intervene further if needed, despite the economy entering a recession. The BoE estimates Britain's economy to shrink 0.1% in the third quarter.

The Central Bank of Sweden too announced a 100 basis points hike in interest rates last week, saying that the inflation was too stubborn. Despite the 100-bps hike, the Riksbank is still behind its inflation target by 0.25%, which indicates further rate hikes. The Swiss central bank also hiked rates by 75 basis points to 0.5% Thursday. The move brought an end to an era of negative rates in Europe.

Against this backdrop, below, we highlight a few ETF areas that won in the third quarter.

MLPs

Global X MLP ETF MLPA – Up 14.6%

ETRACS Alerian MLP Infrastructure Index ETN Series B MLPB – Up 14.4%

Though oil prices declined massively in Q3 due to recessionary fears, MLP companies stood out. The midstream space has lower exposure to volatility in commodity prices. This is because midstream players generate stable fee-based revenues since the transportation and storage assets are being booked by shippers for the long term. Thus, their business model is relatively low-risk, signifying considerably lower exposure to both oil and gas price and volume risks. Plus, MLPs are high-yielding in nature.

Biotech

Virtus LifeSci Biotech Products ETF BBP – Up 14.4%

Virtus LifeSci Biotech Clinical Trials ETF BBC – Up 13.2%

The rally in biotech stocks that started in the middle of June is still in fine fettle. Per FT, hedge funds have started buying beaten-down biotech stocks since they believe that ultra-cheap valuations could revive M&A activity in the space. Many big pharma companies are looking to boost their drug pipelines through acquisitions.

Biotech stocks were huge beneficiaries of the pandemic as many of these companies were developing new vaccines and treatments for COVID-19, leading to a surge in IPOs and venture capital investments.

Clean Energy

First Trust NASDAQ Clean Edge Green Energy Index Fund QCLN – Up 14.1%

Virtus Duff & Phelps Clean Energy ETF (VCLN) – Up 11.3%

Clean-energy shares received a boost from the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The framework provided $370 billion to combat climate change and would be the biggest climate spending package in U.S. history. It included tax credits for wind, solar, hydrogen, and nuclear energy, and battery storage, among other things.

Uranium

Global X Uranium ETF URA – Up 11.8%

The war in Ukraine has accelerated the transition to alternative sources of energy, particularly in view of surging natural gas prices. Nuclear power is back in prominence as governments try to tackle climate change and reduce dependence on Russian fossil fuels. Uranium, used mainly in nuclear power plants, is one of the cleanest ways to produce electricity.

36ab8b8b-3d91-45f6-9596-490ffc5a535f,"Policy decisions and global themes will drive markets going forward, said BlackRock's Jay Jacobs.

These include an emerging middle class, rising food scarcity, and tax credits favoring clean energy.

Jacobs shared three inflation-resistant sectors to invest in for long-term gains.

From fixed income to real estate to equities, raging inflation has dominated the minds and decisions of investors everywhere this year.

It's no different for Jay Jacobs, the US head of thematics and active equity exchange-traded funds at BlackRock, which manages $10 trillion in assets. While technology was once the major market driver, Jacobs said that so far this year the primary market catalyst has been policy decisions, due to a high-inflation backdrop and looming recession fears.

""This is exactly the kind of environment where policy is going to step up and play a bigger role in determining what's happening in the thematic landscape. I think that's likely to persist,"" Jacobs told Insider in a recent interview. ""That's likely to disproportionately impact our long-term structural themes.""

The emphasis has also shifted for investors because of the market's broader pivot from growth to value investing, added Jacobs. ""People are looking for different kinds of themes that still have these long-term powerful growth tailwinds, but are not necessarily just high tech companies anymore,"" he explained.

3 inflation-fighting themes

According to Jacobs, this shift in investing mindset combined with newer policy tailwinds have breathed new life into older industries such as infrastructure, a sector he said can offer portfolios both inflation protection and long-term growth.

""Infrastructure is really in the sweet spot of three different things,"" said Jacobs. From a business perspective, many infrastructure companies are able to set their prices based on current inflation levels, allowing them to pass inflation costs on to consumers.

Infrastructure is also a defensive sector, meaning that company revenues are likely to remain steady even in a recession because of consumers' inherent need for utilities. As an additional catalyst for the sector, Jacobs pointed to Biden's recent $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, as well as worldwide infrastructure spending to enhance global supply chains.

""So you combine the business case, the defensive nature, and the growth opportunity, and infrastructure is really one of our best-positioned themes in this environment,"" said Jacobs.

Due to rising food prices, Jacobs also believes that agricultural technology firms focused on food innovation are another long-term beneficiary of lofty inflation levels.

""The higher we see these food prices get, the more demand there's going to be for agricultural technology solutions to put a lid on those prices,"" he explained.

""Supply is pretty much finite in agriculture because you have a certain amount of arable land for growing crops or raising animal products. But demand is growing very quickly,"" Jacobs continued, pointing to both a growing global population and a rising middle class, especially in emerging markets, both of which he said would ""demand more complex foods.""

The Russian-Ukraine crisis, which has further threatened food security across the globe, has only exacerbated the problem. But it's also accelerated investments into the agricultural technology sector, which Jacobs said is now coming up with creative solutions to expand food supply and cut costs, like growing meat in labs, employing automation for precision watering and spraying, and using indoor vertical farming techniques to grow crops in urban areas.

BlackRock

Finally, Jacobs believes that investing in clean energy can also help hedge portfolios against inflation.

That's because to generate electricity, sustainable energy sources don't require rising variable input costs to the same degree that fossil fuels traditionally do, such as the current natural gas or oil rate. According to Jacobs, most costs are upfront for greener energy solutions, like the cost to build a wind turbine or solar panel.

BlackRock

""There's ongoing maintenance, but not anywhere near to the extent of a natural gas plant where you're constantly going to be paying those natural gas rates,"" he explained. ""So in an inflationary environment like we see today, that's really beneficial to those existing clean energy resources, where they've already paid the costs.""

While sustainable investments haven't yet earned the best reputation for their returns, Jacobs believes that there are several tailwinds driving the sector in the long run. These include tax policies favoring renewable energy solutions, growing energy demand from consumers for cleaner options like electric vehicles, and the fact that renewable energy is often inherently cheaper than the electricity generated from fossil fuels."

Squali said that while he believes Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +4.46% and Google-parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +6.09% GOOG, +6.30% are positioned well to withstand the current macroeconomic turbulence and “emerge stronger from it,” their results will still likely be pressured in the short term.

He trimmed Amazon’s stock price target to $170 from $180 and lowered his target on Alphabet’s stock to $136 from $145. Squali also lowered his third-quarter revenue estimates for Amazon to $125.0 billion from $126.7 billion and for Alphabet to $70.1 billion from $71.2 billion.

“We’ve updated our estimates to reflect growing headwinds from FX along with greater probability of a mild recession in 2023,” Squali wrote in a note to clients. FX refers to foreign exchange, or currency translation.

Also read: ‘We are in deep trouble’: Billionaire investors Druckenmiller believes Fed’s monetary tightening will push the economy into recession in 2023.

Meanwhile, he reiterated the buy ratings he’s had on Amazon and Alphabet for at least the past three years, saying that with valuations at 10-year lows, the market has already discounted much of the lowered outlooks.

Amazon’s stock has tumbled 29.9% year to date and Alphabet shares have shed 31.5%, while the S&P 500 index SPX, +3.09% has declined 22.4%.

A rising dollar can hurt results of multinational companies because it reduces the value of revenue and profit earned overseas. And the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.30% , which tracks the dollar against a basket of currencies of its largest trading partners, has run up 18.0% year to date, which already puts it on track for a record calendar-year gain. It closed at a 20-year high on Tuesday.

Amazon recorded $30.72 billion in international sales during the quarter ended June 30, or 27.2% of total revenue, while Alphabet recorded $33.68 billion, or 54.4% of its revenue outside of the U.S.

Squali also cut his stock-price targets for Meta Platforms Inc. META, +7.89% to $240 from $260 and lowered his third-quarter revenue estimate to $26.8 billion from $27.6 billion, but kept the buy rating he’s had on the social-media giant for at least the past three years.

For Snap Inc. SNAP, +4.99% , he kept his rating at hold and his price target at $12, but raised his third-quarter revenue estimate to $1.14 billion from $1.08 billion, to reflect “improving trends in digital ad demand” for the platform.

Meta derived 60.3% of its revenue for the quarter to June 30 from outside of the U.S., while Snap revenue from outside the U.S. was 32.4% of the total.

Meta’s stock has plunged 58.5% this year, while Snap shares have plummeted 77.4%."

952ace9d-ca6c-48cd-9217-5b66ab9489c6,"LONDON: Borrowing costs in the UK will ultimately determine how far sterling needs to fall to plug the country’s external deficit.

Bonds and sterling have sold off sharply in recent days (notwithstanding the relief rally), but it’s the market with the lower liquidity –gilts – that will be the main determinant of sterling’s performance.

Five-year gilt yields are at around 4.6%, from only 3% earlier this month.

Around 25% of the gilt market is held by overseas investors, so government borrowing costs are very sensitive to capital that could easily find an alternative home (and some surely has already).

When government borrowing costs rise, borrowing costs for the private sector rises –for companies through debt and loans, and for households principally through rising mortgage costs.

Moreover, some of the current rise in rates will get baked in, even if the Bank of England ultimately doesn’t have to hike as high as the 5.5% to 6% the market is currently expecting. The government, or any company issuing debt now, will be locked in at a higher rate.

Ditto for any mortgage holder re-fixing.

There is thus no way for the UK to completely undo the recent damage done.

And the UK has a huge stock of debt it needs to service and refinance, a net £900bil (RM4.52 trillion) of it.

As gilt yields rise, private-sector borrowing costs will also rise, damaging firms’ balance sheets and deterring investment.

On the top of that, mortgage holders will see their costs rise too.

Needless to say, this will be detrimental for the economy.

Sterling is the release valve.

The currency will have to probe to find a level where foreign investors believe the long-term return on UK assets is attractive enough.

Similarly, there will be a level of a sterling where UK holders of foreign assets find it attractive to repatriate the capital.

Unfortunately for the UK, that large debt held by international investors means capital can leave faster than it comes back in. —Bloomberg"
ab0e5e81-86f8-4d39-a3bb-76f29c7f1e7e,"Why is the US dollar so strong, and what does it mean? Published 28 September

Image source, Getty Images

The US dollar is the strongest it's been for two decades, compared with other major currencies.

This means it's more expensive to buy dollars, and dollars buy more pounds, euros or yen.

This affects businesses and households across the world.

How strong is the dollar?

The dollar index (DXY) - which measures the US dollar against an average of six other major currencies, including the euro, pound and yen - has risen 15% in 2022.

By this measure, the dollar is at a 20-year high.

Why is the dollar so strong?

The US central bank has increased interest rates several times this year to try and tackle rising prices.

This has pushed up the returns offered by financial products which use dollars such as US government bonds.

Bonds are a way for governments (and companies) to borrow money, which they promise to repay with interest in the future. Government bonds are generally considered very safe.

Investors from across the world have recently been buying billions of dollars of US bonds.

They have to spend dollars to purchase these bonds, and the extra demand has pushed up the dollar's value.

When investors sell other currencies to buy dollars, they drop in value.

Image source, Getty Images Image caption, There has been a rush to buy US government bonds on Wall Street

Investors also tend to buy dollars when the global economy is under pressure, because the size of the US makes its currency a ""safe haven"". That also puts the price up.

Many economies in Europe and Asia are struggling as a result of soaring gas prices caused by the conflict in Ukraine.

The US hasn't been hit as hard by rising energy prices. Although its economy has shrunk in the last six months, businesses are still taking on staff, which is seen as a sign of continuing confidence.

Why is the dollar so strong against the pound?

The pound hit a record low against the dollar on 26 September, falling to $1.03. It has since recovered a little.

It has fallen by 20% in value against the US dollar since start of the year.

The pound's biggest slump followed a mini-budget in which the Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng outlined a £45bn package of tax cuts, as well as energy subsidies for businesses and households.

He also indicated there would be more tax cuts to come.

Many investors sold UK government bonds, and other UK financial assets, because of fears the chancellor's measures would cause government borrowing to surge to unsustainable levels.

This made the pound drop in value.

How does a strong dollar affect countries with weaker currencies?

Like Sterling, the Japanese yen has fallen 20% in value against the dollar, while the euro has fallen by 15%.

Countries with weaker currencies can benefit from a strong dollar because it makes the goods and services they sell to the US cheaper, which boosts exports.

However, it also means goods imported from the States become more expensive.

Since oil is priced in US dollars, petrol now costs more in many countries around the globe.

In Britain, for example, the average price of a litre of petrol has increased from £1.46 to £1.67 since the start of the year - a rise of 15%.

It peaked at £1.91 in July.

Governments and firms in many countries also often borrow money in US dollars rather than their own currencies because it tends to be more stable.

As the dollar increases in value, it becomes more expensive to repay those debts with local currency.

Argentina's government has been hit particularly hard by the stronger dollar.

It has temporarily banned various imported goods, including yachts and whisky to try to protect its financial reserves.

Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Petrol prices have risen sharply in the UK this year, partly as a result of the strength of the dollar

What are countries doing about the stronger dollar?

Many countries around the world are trying to boost the value of their own currencies by putting up interest rates.

The UK has increased its main rate by 2 percentage points, so far. The Bank of England says that further rises are likely, with many analysts predicting interest rates could rise as high as 6 percent.

The European Central Bank has increased its interest rate by 1.25 percentage points.

Raising interest rates helps to hold down rising prices, but also makes it more expensive for businesses and households to borrow money.

This helps hold down rising prices, but it also means that firms struggle to stay profitable, and may lay off staff. Families may also cut back on spending.

In turn, this can cause countries to slip into recession, meaning the economy shrinks."

Bank of England (BoE) chief economist Huw Pill has hinted at a ""significant"" monetary policy response to come in November to shore up the pound.

The chief economist at the central bank has said that it is hard not to draw the conclusion that recent market uncertainty will require ""a significant monetary response.""

""It is hard not to draw the conclusion that all this will require significant monetary policy response,"" he told a conference. ""We must be confident in the stability of the UK’s economic framework.""

Pill also acknowledged the recent plunging of the pound and said the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) ""cannot be indifferent"" to the repricing of financial assets seen in the last few days.

""We have all seen recent significant fiscal news in the past few days. That has had significant market consequences as well as significant implications for the macro outlook,"" he added.

Speaking at the CEPR-Barclays International Monetary Policy forum, he reassured listeners the MPC’s commitment to bringing inflation back down to its 2% target is unwavering.

Sterling has pushed slightly higher following the chief economist's comments on Tuesday, up 0.8% against the dollar at around $1.07, although it remains off its highs for the day.

While Pill hinted at aggressive monetary policy tightening by Threadneedle Street, he pushed back against calls for emergency action.

""The better way to run monetary policy is to adopt a more considered approach and low-frequency approach,"" he said.

The speech comes a day after the pound plunged to historic lows in response to Kwasi Kwarteng's tax-cutting mini-budget, forcing the chancellor and the BoE to move to reassure markets.

Story continues

On Monday, the central bank opted not to hold an emergency rates meeting to help prop up the pound.

But the central bank said it ""will not hesitate"" to raise interest rates to get inflation under control. Inflation was running at 9.9% in August, nearly five times the Bank's 2% target.

Bank governor Andrew Bailey said the Monetary Policy Committee, which sets rates, would assess the impact on inflation and the fall in sterling at its next meeting in November, and then ""act accordingly"".

Threadneedle Street has already raised rates seven times in a row since December to the highest rate in 14 years to bring 40-year high inflation back to its 2% target.

Pill also said the UK energy support package avoids ""extreme peaks"" in inflation and ""frees monetary policy to do its job"" of tackling prices in the medium term. ""That freedom will have to be used”, he says, suggesting higher rates are on the way.""

The government announced an energy support package that freezes bills at £2,500 a year from October for two years, and a six-month energy support scheme for businesses, costing £60bn in the first six months.

The International Monetary Fund has openly criticised Britain’s new economic strategy following another slide in bond markets that forced the Bank of England to promise a “significant” response to stabilise the economy.

Pressure piled on new finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng to reassess his policy, which unleashed turmoil in financial markets as leading economists, investors and executives said that rock-bottom investor confidence would recover only if the plan was scrapped.

New British Prime Minister Liz Truss of the Conservative Party came into office on September 6 saying she wanted to snap the economy out of years of stagnant growth with deep tax cuts and deregulation.

Mr Kwarteng’s plan is designed to support households and businesses with energy bills while doubling the long-run rate of economic growth. It requires an additional £72 billion ($120 billion) in government debt issuance in this fiscal year alone, shocking investors, sending the costs of such borrowing even higher.

The IMF said the proposals, which sent the pound to touch a record low of $US1.0327 on Monday, would likely increase inequality and it questioned the wisdom of such policies.

“Given elevated inflation pressures in many countries, including the UK, we do not recommend large and untargeted fiscal packages at this juncture, as it is important that fiscal policy does not work at cross purposes to monetary policy,” an IMF spokesperson said.

“We are closely monitoring recent economic developments in the UK and are engaged with the authorities,” the spokesperson said.

The IMF holds symbolic importance in British politics: Its bailout of Britain in 1976 following a balance-of-payments crisis had long been regarded as a low point of modern British economic history.

The IMF said a budget due from Mr Kwarteng on November 23 would provide an “early opportunity for the UK government to consider ways to provide support that is more targeted and re-evaluate the tax measures, especially those that benefit high-income earners”.

Earlier in the day, BoE chief economist Huw Pill said the central bank was likely to deliver a “significant” rate increase when it meets next in November. He said financial market upheaval would have a big impact on the economy and would be factored into its next forecasts."
7b0bc2b6-3055-4c2b-b5b4-ff91a3742228,"The Bank of England has sought to quell a fire-storm in the British bond market, saying it will buy as much government debt as needed to restore financial stability after chaos triggered by the new government's fiscal policy.

Having failed to cool the sell-off with verbal interventions over the previous two days, the BoE announced an emergency move that it said would prevent the turmoil in markets from spreading through the country and seizing up credit flows.

""Were dysfunction in this market to continue or worsen, there would be a material risk to UK financial stability,"" the central bank said in a statement that immediately eased pressures on soaring British government bond yields.

The Treasury said it would fully indemnify the operations.

Sterling was down 0.7 per cent at $US1.065, having dropped to a session low of $US1.0618.

The BoE said it was keeping its goal to reduce its STG838 billion ($A1.39 billion) of gilt holdings by STG80 billion over the next year, but would postpone the start of sales - due to begin next week - because of the market conditions.

Earlier the International Monetary Fund and ratings agency Moody's had ramped up pressure on Britain to reverse its new strategy that was set out by new finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng on Friday in a move that he said would ignite economic growth.

The rare intervention about a G7 country from the IMF, the global lender of last resort, underscored the severity of the situation facing Britain, with the value of the pound and British bonds collapsing since Friday.

The Bank of England said on Monday it would not hesitate to raise interest rates and was monitoring markets ""very closely"". On Tuesday its Chief Economist Huw Pill said the central bank was likely to deliver a ""significant"" rate increase when it meets next in November.

Despite those comments, the market had remained in turmoil.

Earlier on Wednesday 30-year British government bond yields rose above 5 per cent for the first time since 2002. Following the BoE statement, 30-year yields dropped more than 50 basis points on the day.

The latest crisis to hit the British state was triggered by Kwarteng's plans for deep tax cuts and deregulation to snap the economy out of a long period of stagnation, seen as a return to Thatcherite and Reaganomics doctrines of the 1980s.

With the cost of British borrowing soaring, mortgage lenders pulled hundreds of products and anecdotal reports said people were struggling to get through to lenders to either complete or change mortgage deals.

That would mark a major shock in a country where rising house prices have for years conveyed a sense of overall affluence, and where home buyers have got used to more than a decade of rock-bottom interest rates.

The IMF said the proposals, which sent the pound to an all-time low of $US1.0327 on Monday, would add to a crisis of credibility after the government cut taxes and hiked borrowing just as the Bank of England lifts interest rates to tackle surging inflation.

""Given elevated inflation pressures in many countries, including the UK, we do not recommend large and untargeted fiscal packages at this juncture, as it is important that fiscal policy does not work at cross purposes to monetary policy,"" an IMF spokesperson said.

In a blunt release, Moody's said large unfunded tax cuts were ""credit negative"" for Britain, risking structurally higher funding costs that could weaken the economy.

Kwarteng, an economic historian who was business minister for two years, has responded to the criticism by insisting that tax cuts for the wealthy alongside support for energy prices are the only way to reignite economic growth."

High commodity prices have helped keep the Australian dollar's losses to a minimum this year, making it the third-placed currency in the Group of 10 behind Swiss franc and the Canadian dollar. But that dominance has weakened as global measures of risk sentiment collapse, such as all three US equity benchmarks slipping into bear market territory as of Monday.

Iron ore futures traded in Singapore on Wednesday fell 1.8 per cent to $US95.50 a tonne. Accusations of Russian sabotage involving Europe's Nord Stream gas pipeline system sent energy prices rocketing and the ASX's coal stocks rallying.

Magellan co-founder Chris Mackay told MFF Capital investors at MFF's annual meeting on Wednesday that Australia's medium-term position has weakened in relative and absolute terms ""despite valuable iron ore and other commodity price and volume strength"".

He cited inflation, the cost of accelerated decarbonisation, and ""unconstrained no-fault populism"" challenging the federation.

""Currently, every day, almost everywhere, central bankers occupy the spotlight, and hammer inflation with imperfect tools of higher short-term interest rates and quantitative tightening,"" Mr Mackay said. ""Probabilities of central bank policy errors requiring reversals are increasing.""

Mr Mackay is worth an estimated $726 million according to this year's Financial Review Rich List.

The US dollar will keep rising, strategists say, until the US Federal Reserve stops raising interest rates. On its own projections, it will arrive at its peak in 2023.

He described the collapse in the British pound this week to a historic low as ""classic EM"", shorthand for emerging markets. ""You've got a terrible, terrible situation for a lot of these economies.""

Mr Gor said there would be idiosyncratic moves, but the currency pain was largely indiscriminate: ""It's more just dollar strength. Everyone's in a bad place.""

He has argued that fiscal policy can counteract the destructive force of this monetary cycle, but the market reaction to the Truss government's pro-growth fiscal strategy suggested that was unwise.

G10 contender

ANZ this week projected a concurrent recession in Britain, the euro area, and the US in 2023.

“The US dollar will continue to attract safe haven bids as we expect global recessionary fears to deepen in the coming months,” ANZ’s foreign exchange strategists wrote.

However, ANZ is bullish on Australia's role in the G10 pecking order because it is an energy exporter with structurally attractive qualities. Its end-2024 Australian dollar forecast is US75¢.

“Robust US economic momentum will keep the Fed tightening well into 2023 and this will continue to suck capital away from risk proxies like the AUD.

""Domestically, however the story remains positive,"" ANZ said. ""Against other G10 pairs, however, we think the AUD can perform well given the strong domestic backdrop and positive terms of trade story.""

Retail sales data on Wednesday beat expectations with August growth of 0.6 per cent in seasonally adjusted terms against consensus for growth of 0.4 per cent. Economists said this would support the case for the Reserve Bank to increase interest rates by 0.5 percentage points in October to 2.85 per cent.

By the end of August, the Reserve Bank had completed 1.75 percentage points worth of monetary tightening, according to National Australia Bank.

NAB markets economist, Taylor Nugent, said that low readings of consumer confidence are not translating to reduced spending.

""The much vaunted rebalance away from goods has also not occurred on the whole, while services spending looks to be now matching elevated goods demand,"" he said.

Meanwhile, markets will keep picking off the weakest links from 40 years of declining risk-free rates.

""When you're getting 4 and 4.5 per cent, everything else doesn't look that great,"" Mr Gor said. ""It's the opposite of what happened pretty much from the GFC.""

Caterpillar

Mining equipment manufacturer Caterpillar (CAT) is navigating supply chain snarls and cost pressures like a champion. Cost-saving and pricing actions are helping the company improve its top and bottom lines even when end markets remain volatile. The North American housing market has slowed considerably, with the ill effects trickling down to construction equipment demand. However, Cowen analyst Matt Elkott thinks that end-markets like housing are expected to show improvement in 2023 and will recover more meaningfully in 2024. (See Caterpillar Stock Chart on TipRanks). Elkott also expects a late-2023 recovery in revenues once the Biden administration's infrastructure bill kicks in. Revenue benefits from the bill should also be meaningful in 2024. Additionally, Elkott is optimistic about Caterpillar's services segment growth. ""Growth in the company's services revenue is on track to meet the goal of doubling by 2026 to $28B. The new state of global energy insecurity should be supportive of oil & gas CapEx, at least by the privates for now,"" the analyst noted. Elkott has a buy rating and a $225 price target on the stock. He holds the 782nd position among almost 8,000 analysts tracked on TipRanks and has a success rate of 52%. Each of his ratings has garnered average returns of 12.5%.

National Instruments

National Instruments (NATI) has a resilient business of developing automated testing and measurement systems to aid the research and validation of new technologies. Earlier this year, the lockdown in Shanghai and suspension of operations in Russia hurt the company's business. Nonetheless, Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney is bullish on the company. (See National Instruments Dividend Date & History on TipRanks). National Instruments operates in industry-specific business units (BU's), which are dependent on secular trends, and a BU portfolio that is exposed to macroeconomic factors. Now, the company is focusing on achieving its target of bringing in at least 74% of its revenue from its industry-specific BU's by 2025. This transition is expected to make the company more resilient to market cycles in the coming years. Strong uptrends in emerging technologies like ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems), electric vehicles and 5G make Delaney believe that the company can withstand an economic slowdown better than many, ""as parts of its business are tied to secularly growing end markets"" that have defensive characteristics. The analyst has a buy rating on NATI stock with a price target of $49. Delaney, who is ranked No. 765 among nearly 8,000 analysts ranked on TipRanks, has had success with 56% of his ratings. An average of 9.8% returns were generated on each of his ratings.

Plug Power

Hydrogen fuel cell developer Plug Power (PLUG) is one of the top beneficiaries of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which was signed into law last month. According to the law, a $3 per kg production tax credit will be provided to developers producing green hydrogen (hydrogen produced with electrolyzers sourced from clean energy). H.C. Wainwright analyst Amit Dayal thinks the IRA helps taxpayers in the hydrogen industry ""to stack credits and allow for transfer of hydrogen-related tax credits."" To this end, Plug Power has already entered several partnerships with major companies, including Amazon (AMZN), to supply green hydrogen and electrolyzers, and Dayal expects more such deals to be signed in 2023. (See Plug Power Blogger Opinions & Sentiment on TipRanks). ""We believe the IRA should be supportive to Plug' s target of building out its green hydrogen generation network to 70 tons per day (TPD) production by the end of 2022, 500TPD in North America by 2025 and 1,000TPD globally by 2028,"" noted Dayal. Dayal is also eager for Plug Power to begin scaling and absorbing its early upfront investment costs, as this would boost its near-term financial performance by improving operating costs and margins. The analyst expects the company to generate operating profits in 2025. ""We believe that the company should be able to grow its gross margins from negative levels today to 15.7% in 2023 and subsequently reach approximately 35.0% by 2030 as revenues continue to rise,"" projected Dayal. Interestingly, Dayal is a five-star rated analyst on TipRanks, and is ranked No. 27 among almost 8,000 analysts tracked on the platform. About 42% of his ratings have been successful and have generated 44.9% average returns per instance.

Salesforce

As its ticker symbol suggests, Salesforce (CRM) is a customer relationship management software giant, which is benefiting from the growing digitalization of industries. The company last week provided an upbeat medium-term revenue and margin forecast, which pulled more investors to its shares. Expansion of the company's addressable market, geographic spread and customer base are key growth catalysts that are helping it navigate the pessimism around tech stocks with finesse. (See Salesforce Stock Investors on TipRanks). Monness Crespi Hardt analyst Brian White predicted that the current headwinds, including recession-related concerns, inflationary pressures and growing geopolitical issues, will keep Salesforce from realizing its full growth potential over the next 12-18 months. Still, White is one of the Salesforce bulls, who hold strong convictions about the company's longer-term prospects. Although White acknowledged the problems that might come with a recession (which looks almost impossible to avoid, as of now), he said that Salesforce is ""uniquely positioned"" to benefit from accelerated digital transformation in the long run. ""Salesforce has demonstrated an ability to navigate turbulent times better than most software companies, a testament to relentless innovation, acquisitions, excellent execution, and strong secular trends,"" White said. The analyst reiterated his buy rating on Salesforce. He has a price target of $215. White holds a rank of 484 among nearly 8,000 analysts tracked on TipRanks. Fifty-seven percent of his ratings have been profitable, with each generating average returns of 10.4%.

If the goal is to find stocks to buy when prices are lower rather than higher, it stands to reason that the time to go looking for the best stocks to buy is right now.

After all, the market is off by more than a fifth so far this year, which means it's probably safe to assume that most investors are fearful. And if most investors are fearful, well… doesn't Warren Buffett say that this is the time to get at least a little bit greedy?

Finding quality stocks to buy when seemingly everything is selling off is easier said than done, of course. And if you're looking for help from Wall Street analysts, good luck. There's a saying about analysts: ""In a bull market you don't need them; in a bear market you don't want them.""

That's far too harsh as an assessment – but understandable as a sentiment. It's well known that Wall Street analysts are reluctant to slap Sell calls on the stocks they cover. There are a number of reasons for this reticence, but that's a discussion for another day.

Perhaps less well known is that analysts are also pretty stingy when it comes to bestowing the highest conviction Buy recommendations on the names they follow.

As of Sept. 22, only five stocks in the S&P 500 carried consensus recommendations of Sell or Strong Sell, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. At the other end of the ratings spectrum, 392 of the index's 500 stocks had consensus recommendations of Buy or Strong Buy.

That's far too many Buy calls, to be sure. We know for a fact that the vast majority of stocks turn out to be duds. Research shows that the entirety of the $75.7 trillion in net global stock market wealth created between 1990 and 2020 was generated solely by the top-performing 2.4% of stocks.

To be fair, when analysts issue Buy recommendations, all they're saying is that they expect the stock in question to outperform the broader market by some margin, or deliver, say, a 15% total return, over the next 12 months or so. Every research shop has different definitions and metrics, but analysts are not making 30-year calls.

And yet, consensus Buy calls are so abundant that it's only natural to be at least somewhat skeptical of their value.

Happily, there is a subset of consensus Buy calls that are not so freely dispensed. Within the Street's decidedly overoptimistic universe of 392 consensus Buy-rated stocks, only 24 – or 4.8% of all the names in the S&P 500 – get a consensus recommendation of Strong Buy.

True, Strong Buy calls are nowhere near as rare as Sell or Strong Sell calls. But they are special nonetheless. Perhaps – just perhaps – analysts are on to something when they collectively possess such high conviction on a name?

With that as our admittedly hopeful hypothesis, we used S&P Global Market Intelligence data to screen the S&P 500 for stocks with Strong Buy consensus recommendations and implied upside of at least 20% in the next 12 months or so, based on share prices and analysts' average price targets as of Sept. 21.

Have a look at the table below and you'll see that only 19 stocks made the cut.

Prominent names include beaten-down mega-cap stocks such as Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL). Real estate investment trusts (REITs) HCA Healthcare (HCA) and Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) also make appearances. You will likewise see representatives from the financial, energy and industrial sectors, to name just a few.

But all these stocks do have at least three things in common: They are in the S&P 500, they sport Strong Buy consensus recommendations from Wall Street industry analysts, and their average price targets give them implied upside of anywhere from 20% to nearly 90% in the not-too-distant future.

“Even in a plain vanilla recession, the S&P 500 can fall by 30 per cent,” said Roubini, chairman and chief executive officer of Roubini Macro Associates, in an interview on Monday. In “a real hard landing,” which he expects, it could fall 40 per cent.

Roubini, whose prescience on the housing bubble crash of 2007 to 2008 earned him the nickname ‘Dr Doom’, said that those expecting a shallow US recession should be looking at the large debt ratios of corporations and governments. As rates rise and debt servicing costs increase, “many zombie institutions, zombie households, corporates, banks, shadow banks and zombie countries are going to die,” he said. “So we’ll see who’s swimming naked.”

Roubini, who has warned that global debt levels will drag down markets, said achieving a 2 per cent inflation rate without a hard landing is going to be “mission impossible” for the Federal Reserve. He expects a 75 basis points rate hike at the current meeting and 50 basis points in both November and December. That would lead the Fed funds rate by year’s end to be between 4 per cent and 4.25 per cent."
96ee7723-5c79-4386-8d5e-471f9143e315,"One of the first experts to forecast the 2008 recession is sounding the alarm bells that another big economic downturn is on the way.

With recession fears in the U.S. mounting, many economists are predicting such a downturn as early as this year. Earlier this month, Bank of America strategists wrote they expected a “mild recession” to hit sometime next year. Others, like former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, have been more bearish with their recession forecasts, predicting that only a deep recession will be enough to fix the 40-year-high inflation hitting the country.

Now economist Nouriel Roubini—a New York University professor and the CEO of Roubini Macro Associates—whose prescience of the 2007 and 2008 housing market crash earned him the nickname Dr. Doom—seems to have chosen a side.

In an interview with Bloomberg this week, Roubini said that a recession is likely to hit the U.S. by the end of 2022 before spreading globally next year, conceivably lasting for the entirety of 2023.

“It’s not going to be a short and shallow recession; it’s going to be severe, long, and ugly,” Roubini said.

The debt problem

To fend off rising U.S. inflation, the Federal Reserve has implemented an aggressive series of interest rate hikes to put the brakes on the economy. The goal is to engineer a soft landing for the economy, where inflation returns to the Fed’s target 2% annual rate, without triggering a prolonged economic downturn or significant rise in unemployment.

But with the current economic climate, the Fed’s soft landing goal is “mission impossible” according to Roubini, who sees the rapid rise in both corporate and government debt over the past year as a damning indicator.

During the 2008 recession, Roubini argued that large amounts of consumer and corporate debt had been mismanaged and neglected by credit agencies and the federal government, contributing to the downturn. In his interview with Bloomberg, he noted that very similar threats are facing the economy today.

Roubini said that the environment created by rising interest rates does not bode well for the rising levels of global debt amassed in the wake of the pandemic. As lending rates continue to increase—as the Federal Reserve has signaled they will—it could create a growing number of so-called zombie companies, firms that formed during the pre- and early-pandemic era of easy credit, but are now stumbling along unable to turn a profit or finance their debts.

“Many zombie institutions, zombie households, corporates, banks, shadow banks, and zombie countries are going to die” as rates continue rising, Roubini said.

The “long and ugly recession” will also devastate financial markets, Roubini warned. The S&P 500—which upon last week’s higher-than-expected inflation reading had one of its worst days this year—could fall by anywhere between 30% and 40%, he said, depending on how severe the recession is.

Worst-case scenario

But despite interest rate hike after interest rate hike, Roubini said that inflation in the U.S. could persist due to rippling supply-chain shocks from the pandemic, the ongoing consequences of the Ukraine war, and China’s zero-COVID policy continuing to slow economic activity in the country.

That combination of low economic growth and unyielding inflation could lead to a global worst-case scenario of 1970s-style stagflation, Roubini warned, where prices remain high but economies stagnate anyway. Institutions including the World Bank have warned multiple times this year that a return to 1970s stagflation remains a serious concern for the global economy.

It is far from the first time Roubini has expressed his pessimistic views on the economy’s future. In 2020, Roubini warned that a new “great depression” was poised to hit the U.S. during the 2020s, citing rising debt levels. And in July, Roubini predicted that a “severe recession and a severe debt and financial crisis” was just around the corner due to the growing number of zombie companies in the economy.

Not every market watcher agrees with Roubini’s view that rising debt levels and inflation will send the economy spiraling into a deep recession. Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood tweeted on Tuesday that hawkish economists like Roubini were set to be “blindsided” by inflation receding soon, citing “unwinding” headline inflation, the measure of total inflation within the economy."
41fb1914-14eb-4d1e-8e92-adead40ba91f,"The U.S. Federal Reserve holds inordinate sway over the world’s economies – yet it acts, in some ways, like they don’t really matter.

Its power is primarily because of the dominance of the U.S. dollar, which soared in recent months as the Fed’s aggressive interest rate hikes made the greenback more attractive to investors. But this has a downside for other countries because it is fueling inflation, raising the cost of borrowing and increasing the risk of a global recession.

If you only paid attention to the words of Fed Chair Jerome Powell, however, you probably would have no idea this is happening. He hasn’t said a peep in his public speeches about the significant risks to the global economy as central banks jack up interest rates to tame inflation – including the Fed’s 0.75 percentage point increase on Sept. 21, 2022.

This may seem a bit odd that the Fed would appear to be so blasé about the global economy that it arguably leads. Yet as a finance scholar, I believe it makes perfect sense – though there are risks.

The Fed’s domestic focus

The Federal Reserve is mandated to focus on the U.S. economy, and it takes this job very seriously.

While central banks are aware of all global economic data, they focus on their own economies, helping them do what is best for their own nations. In the U.S., that means the Fed is focused on improving the American economy through stable prices and full employment.

As a result, when the U.S. economy is slowing too quickly and people are losing jobs, such as early in the pandemic, the Fed lowers interest rates – no matter the impact on other countries. Similarly, when the economy is growing but consumer prices are rising too fast, the central bank raises interest rates.

And its global impact

Yet it’s unavoidable that the Fed’s policies will influence economies, companies and citizens in virtually every country in the world.

While all central banks influence the rest of the world, the Fed has a much larger impact because of the size of the U.S. economy – it remains by far the largest in absolute terms – and the prominence of the U.S. dollar in international markets and trade.

Approximately half of the world’s international debt is denominated in dollars, which means countries need to pay interest and principle on what they borrow in greenbacks. The dollar has soared almost 15% this year relative to a basket of foreign currencies, largely as a result of the Fed interest rate hikes that began in March. That means it’s, on average, 15% more expensive to finance those dollar-denominated debts – and for some countries, it could be a lot more.

Moreover, about 60% of all global foreign exchange reserves – that’s the money central banks hold to protect the value of their own currencies – are in dollars. And since most major commodities like oil and gold are priced in dollars, a stronger dollar makes everything cost a lot more for businesses and consumers in every country.

Finally, when U.S. interest rates are high relative to those in other countries, more foreign investment flocks to the U.S. to get more bang for their buck. Since there’s only so much money to go around, this drains investment from other economies, especially emerging markets. And it means they have to raise interest rates to keep foreign direct investment flowing into their countries, which can hurt their local economies.

Risks in a global world

Unfortunately, focusing solely on the domestic economy has its own risks.

It may sound cliche, but we do live in a global, interconnected world – something demonstrated powerfully by the COVID-19 pandemic and the supply chain issues that repeatedly rippled across the world. American businesses depend on other countries for supplies, workers and consumers.

That means even if the Fed manages a proverbial soft landing and is able to reduce inflation without causing a recession, a global downturn may still ultimately reach American shores. This could threaten much of the Fed’s success if the global slowdown results in international instability or food insecurity.

So while I believe the Fed is correct to keep its focus on the U.S. economy and lift rates as much as it deems necessary, I’ll be looking closely at how the central bank’s economic projections evolve. If the data shows the U.S. economy’s inflation problems diminishing, the Fed may be able to begin to think a bit less about what’s happening in its own backyard and more about the impact of its policies on the rest of the world."

NEW YORK, Sept 21 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The Federal Reserve has named the price of killing inflation: a couple of years of slow growth and a million more people out of work. If that’s all it takes to beat back rising prices, it’s a cost worth bearing, especially because if Chair Jay Powell is wrong, he passes his problem onto U.S. President Joe Biden.

The U.S. central bank raised rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday and indicated that they could go even higher than investors have expected. The Fed’s rate-setting committee now thinks its benchmark rate could go as high as 4.6% in 2023, where investors had been betting on a peak of around 4.4%, according to the Atlanta Fed. Unemployment may hit 4.4%, suggesting a 1.3 million increase in joblessness.

For now, the Fed thinks it can manage this without a hard landing. While GDP growth could slump to 0.2% this quarter and 1.2% a year from now – far below the 2% the Fed thinks is the long-run norm – the rate-setters think things will be back on track by the end of 2024. That will hurt companies in the short term, and some are already squeaking from slowing growth read more , but it’s better than a long, slow grind.

Based on previous interest-rate cycles, the Fed is either being optimistic or trying to break the bad news gently. Even so, Powell is correct to say that inflation is worse than even a reversal in growth. Unemployment brings distress for millions, but rising prices hurt more or less everyone. Around half of small businesses now say inflation is their biggest challenge, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the public agrees, a Pew survey showed in May.

Moreover, the risk that an economic slowdown does lasting damage is slight. Banks are reporting that their customers still have more money in the bank than they did before Covid-19 hit, and delinquencies are ticking up, but only slowly. JPMorgan (JPM.N) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told a Congressional panel hours before the Fed’s rate hike that the financial industry can “easily handle a hard landing.”

Powell lamented on Wednesday that there’s no way to reset the economy without pain. That’s the kind of thing an independent central banker can say without fear. If the severity of that pain is greater than he is expecting now, it tosses the hot potato over to Biden and Congress. They will spend the next two years dealing with elevated unemployment and economic glumness. Powell’s approach may kill inflation, but lose him some powerful friends in the process.

CONTEXT NEWS

The Federal Reserve’s rate-setting committee increased the target range for the federal funds rate by 75 basis points on Sept. 21, to between 3% and 3.25%. It was the third hike of that size since May.

The Fed said in a statement that inflation remained elevated, echoing its previous statement in July, with “modest growth” in spending and production.

In its updated set of economic projections, the Fed forecast 4.4% unemployment in 2024, compared with its previous forecast of 4.1%. It also projected that its targeted interest rate could max out at 4.6% in 2023.

Annualized inflation hit 8.3% in August, according to Department of Labor data released on Sept. 13, a slight deceleration from the previous month but featuring the largest increase in food prices since 1979.

Before the Fed’s announcement, investors placed an 84% probability on a 75-basis-point hike, according to the CME Group’s Fedwatch tool.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images

The Federal Reserve ordered another super-sized jump in interest rates today, and signaled that additional rate hikes are likely in the coming months, as it tries to put the brakes on runaway prices.

The central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points Wednesday, matching hikes in June and July. The Fed has been boosting borrowing costs at the fastest pace in decades. But so far, its actions have done little to curb the rapid run-up in prices.

The annual inflation rate in August was 8.3% — down only slightly from the month before. While the price of gasoline has dropped sharply from its record high in June, and used cars and airline tickets have gotten somewhat cheaper, other costs — including rent, groceries and electricity — continue to climb.

""My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power,"" Fed chairman Jerome Powell told reporters, ""especially for those least able to meet the higher cost of essentials.""

What's more, price hikes have begun to spread to goods and services that are not directly affected by the pandemic or the war in Ukraine, suggesting that inflation has gained momentum that may not be quickly reversed.

Sending a 'tough love' message on interest rates

""Inflation is still running hot and is not easing as fast as expected,"" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate.com. ""The Fed has been delivering a 'tough love' message that interest rates will be higher, and for longer, than expected.""

The central bank has raised its benchmark rate five times this year — from near zero to 3.125%. On average, Fed policymakers think rates will climb to about 4.4% by the end of this year and 4.6% by the end of next year.

By making it more expensive to buy a car, get a mortgage or use a credit card, the Fed hopes to tamp down consumer demand, which has been outstripping supply and pushing prices higher.

""If we don't get inflation down, we're in trouble,"" Fed governor Christopher Waller said this month. ""So that's the number one job.""

The housing market is feeling the effects. Mortgage rates have soared to the highest level since 2008, while sales of existing homes have dropped in each of the last seven months. Falling home sales also cuts demand for things like furniture and appliances.

Overall consumer spending remains strong, however, so Fed policymakers will continue to tighten the screws.

""The Fed will continue to hike rates until it actually restrains the economy and intends to keep rates at those restrictive levels until inflation is unmistakably on its way to 2%,"" McBride said.

Doing whatever it takes to get inflation under control

The prospect that interest rates will stay higher for longer has rattled investors in recent weeks, producing big swings on Wall Street.

Fed policymakers now expect significantly slower economic growth this year than they did in June, as well as slightly higher unemployment. But they've stressed their willingness to do whatever it takes to get inflation under control.

""No one knows whether this process will lead to a recession or, if so, how significant that recession would be,"" Powell said. ""Nonetheless, we're committed to getting inflation back down to 2%, because we think that a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain later on.""

With unemployment near a 50-year low at 3.7% and businesses adding hundreds of thousands of jobs each month, Waller argues the Fed can afford to take a hard line on prices.

""If unemployment were to stay under, say 5%, I think we could really be really aggressive on inflation,"" he said. ""Once it gets over 5%, there's going to be obvious pressure to start making tradeoffs.""

Powell insists the central bank will not be swayed by political pressure to take its foot off the brake prematurely. He argues that's the mistake policymakers repeatedly made in the 1970s, allowing inflation to become more firmly entrenched.

""We will keep at it until the job is done,"" Powell told an audience at the CATO Institute this month. ""The longer inflation remains well above target, the greater the risk that the public does begin to see higher inflation as the norm, and that has the capacity to really raise the cost of getting inflation down.""

Recent surveys have shown that despite today's high inflation rate, Americans expect prices to stabilize in the next few years. People have grown more confident of that over the summer as the cost of gasoline — with its highly visible price tag — has fallen."

The Ethereum developers had for a long time suggested miners migrate to other proof of work projects like Ethereum Classic. Prior to the Merge, there was reasonable social activity around proof of work based blockchain networks. On the other side, a White House report on energy usage indicated that the U.S. government would have to curtail mining dependent on excessive energy usage.

The report suggested placing a limit or a ban on crypto mining, particularly the energy inefficient way. The White House mentioned its restrictions on high energy intensity consensus mechanisms like the proof of work method.

Ethereum Miners Migrate To These Cryptocurrencies

Following Ethereum’s shift to the new consensus mechanism, miners shifted to a few other projects. The miners are largely dependent on just a few blockchains — Ethereum Classic, Ergo and Ravencoin. According to a Forbes report, these projects are reasonably better options considering the mining capabilities and rewards. Hence, on the day The Merge successfully completed, these cryptocurrencies saw huge spike in hashrate. Hash rate is the total computational power used by cryptocurrencies to mine and process transactions. This indicates the speed of mining on the blockchain network.

Miner Profits Plunge

Hashrates on Ethereum Classic, Ravencoin, and Ergo surged by 124%, 98% and 146% respectively following Ethereum Merge completion on September 17. However, the mining capabilities on these networks only support a fraction of what Ethereum offered before The Merge. While hashrate for Ethereum before the Merge was around 867 (TH/s), these three networks offer only 28% of it. Morover, with increased miner traffic on these networks, profits have decreased compared with pre-Merge levels.

Meanwhile, the price of Ethereum Classic (ETC) plunged post The Merge and failed to recover since. As of writing, ETC price stands at $34.21, down 1.13% in the last 24 hours, according to price tracking platform CoinMarketCap. Same is the case with Ethereum (ETH) which is continuing to fluctuate in post Merge levels. As of writing, ETH price stands at $1,454.58, up 0.73% in the last 24 hours.

Last week, SEC chief Gary Gensler said crypto assets that allow staking would have to qualify a criteria. The criteria, called as the Howey Test, assesses whether the assets are securities are not.

Post the Merge event last week, The ETH price has come under severe correction losing more than 20% in a week’s time. As of press time, ETH is trading 5.6% down at a price of $1,260 with a market cap of $154 billion. As per on-chain data provider Santiment, Ethereum’s larger addresses have substantially lowered their supply post the Merge upgrade. It adds:

The #Ethereum #merge on 9/15 has brought on a shift in large address behavior. In the past 6 days since the shift to #proofofstake, addresses holding 1k to 10k $ETH have dropped 2.24% of their cumulative holdings. 100 to 1k addresses have dropped 1.41%.

The sell-off in ETH across the broader crypto market remains severe. While other altcoins have registered single percentage digit weekly losses, ETH is down by more than 20%. However, there’s one altcoin that’s trading against the tide, and that is Ripple’s XRP.

Whales Shift Their Attention to Ripple’s XRP

Over the last week, there’s strong buying seen in ripple XRP which has shot up by 20% on the weekly charts. As of press time, XRP is trading at $0.40 with a market cap of $20.2 billion. The recent price surge comes on the reports of XRP soon reaching a settlement with the U.S. SEC. As per on-chain data provider Santiment:

#XRPNetwork is +17%this past week, while #Bitcoin (-5%), #Ethereum (-16%), and most of #crypto has declined. The ongoing battles between #Ripple & the #SEC regarding increased regulation has mainly led to increased trader optimism & high whale movement.

Apart from altcoins, Bitcoin is also facing strong selling pressure dropping 7% over the last week. On Wednesday, the BTC price dropped under $19,000 as the Fed announced a 75 basis points rate hike to combat the soaring inflating.

However, 24 hour trading volume has jumped by a whopping 65% to stand at $81.1 billion. Meanwhile, the biggest cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum have dropped by 6% and 10% respectively.

Ethereum faces massive liquidation post merge

The correlation between the traditional market and macroeconomic conditions has played a major role in increasing fear among investors.

As market indices printed red indexers, investors have shifted a huge amount of their money out over the past 24 hours. According to Coinglass, over 124K traders have liquidated more than $420 million worth of funds from the crypto market in the last 24 hours.

The largest single liquidation of $10 million took place on the Bitmex exchange.

Meanwhile, the data suggest that over $161 million have been liquidated from the second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum. ETH has led the amount of liquidation over the past 24 hours. However, this was not expected just after the historic Ethereum merge.

Ethereum prices have dropped by around 10% over the past day. ETH is trading at an average price of $1,309. It went on to dip under the crucial $1.3k price level to trade at $1,289. However, its 24 hour trading volume has surged by 101% to stand at $20.6 billion.

The Ethereum prices have dropped by around 25% over the past 7 days, that too amid and after the most anticipated Ethereum Merge.

On the other side, the optimism around Ethereum (ETH) earned the cryptocurrency a significant market dominance. However, with the prices dropping after The Merge completion, Ethereum dominance is dropping, potentially indicating buy opportunity for Bitcoin as well. Meanwhile, BTC price appears to be on a freefall with the price dropping to below $19,000.

Short Ethereum Rally Could Be Good For Bitcoin Buying Too?

Recent behavior shows that strong buying pressure around ETH could create an opportunity to buy Bitcoin as well. This is more so whenever Ethereum surges by over 20%. With the recent price behavior, there could be a strong possibility of price decline in Ethereum and Bitcoin. Both the top cryptocurrencies have in the recent times showed declining pattern whenever ETH dominance rose above 20%.

During the middle of August, Bitcoin price was on a declining trend when Ethereum dominance exceeded 20%. Similarly, Ethereum was falling at around August 1, posing a buying opportunity. According to Crypto Quant statistics, this situation could portray a good time to enter a position.

“If the ETH dominance rises by more than 20%, it provides a good timing to enter the short position. Two recent signs of indicators have occurred, indicating a strong fall signal. If you use the two signals properly, you can prepare for the down trend.”

More Drop In Prices Ahead?

This trend is actually reflecting in the sudden drop in crypto prices in last few hours. While BTC is down nearly 6% in last 24 hours, ETH dropped in value by close to 8%. As of writing, Ethereum (ETH) price stands at $1,336.99, down 6.96% in the last 24 hours, according to price tracking platform CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is trading at $19,119. It remains to be seen if the crypto assets will drop further.

At the current levels, Ethereum dominance based on market cap is nearly 18.50% while that of Bitcoin is 41.02%. For close to one week before The Merge, ETH share was above 20%. This is the highest peak ETH dominance in recent times, with the highest share of market value being 21.59%.

The recent widespread correction in the crypto market reverted the Ethereum price from $1800 resistance.

The four-time chart shows a lower price rejection candle at the $1420 support indicating the traders are actively buying at this level. Moreover, the RSI indicator displaying bullish divergence to base support indicates a better possibility for price reversal.

If this theory worked out, the Ethereum price could rally 3.88% higher to challenge the $1470 neckline of double bottom pattern. A bullish breakout from this resistance will further encourage buying activity and retest the $1575 supply zone.

Anyhow, the price action at this level is crucial to influence future Ethereum prices.

Due to the accumulation of daily EMAs at this level, a possible reversal could display a lower high in the daily chart indicating a losing bearing momentum.

However, if the Ethereum price surpasses this level, it indicates the recent correction was just panic selling in the market.

One of the truisms of personal finance is that time is an asset when it comes to investing: The earlier you start, the more time your money has to grow. This is true even if you don’t have a lot of money. For one thing, it’s good to get into the habit of putting something aside for the future. For another, even small amounts of savings will reap rewards over the long term.

Of course, when you’re starting small, you’re not going to be signing up for an expensive financial planner or a wealth adviser who only takes on clients with a high net worth. So how do you begin? This guide will walk you through the basics.

Investing is about risk and reward. Investing gains are rarely guaranteed, and that’s the tradeoff you make: recognizing you could lose money.kate monakhova/iStockPhoto / Getty Images

Invest for long-term gains; save for short-term goals

One thing to keep in mind is that there is a difference between saving and investing. Saving simply means putting money aside, whereas investing means you’re using your money (or another asset) to try and earn financial returns. Remember also that investing is about risk and reward. Investing gains are rarely guaranteed, and that’s the tradeoff you make: recognizing you could lose money.

“As a rule, investing is for long-term goals, saving is for short-term goals,” says independent investment consultant Darryl Brown, who defines short-term as within the next five years. The volatility of stock markets means that they’re not the best place to put money you’ll need in the near future. The ideal investing time frame for stocks, says The Globe and Mail’s Rob Carrick, is 10 years or more.

Mr. Brown recommends that people ensure they have an emergency fund: at least six months’ worth of living expenses put aside in a safe and easy-to-access location, such as a high-interest savings account. Once your emergency fund is set up, you can start directing funds into an investment account to start building a long-term investment portfolio.

Look for ‘free money’: Does your employer have a top-up program?

If you have investment top-ups available to you, they’re a good place to focus your initial investment efforts.

For example, many employers offer matching contributions to workplace retirement savings plans. This means that if you sign up for the company pension plan, group registered retirement savings plan or other similar initiative, your employer will put money in alongside your own contributions. Mr. Carrick calls it “free money” and gives one example of a company that pitches in 50 cents for every dollar an employee invests and, remarkably, still struggles to get people to sign up.

Registered education savings plans (RESP) are another example. They are a government savings tool to help families save for their children’s education. Opening and contributing to an RESP gives you access to government grants and top-ups, and the earlier you open these accounts, the longer your money has to grow. Low-income families are eligible for grants even if they aren’t able to contribute their own cash – but they do have to create an account. If you have children, make sure you’re maximizing your benefits from this program.

Make a budget and set up automatic withdrawals

Even if your income is low, it’s a good idea to get into the habit of creating a budget that includes money for investing. The trick is to pay yourself first, what investor Jack Harding defines as treating saving and investing just like your rent or mortgage – an absolute necessity. “I view savings as a non-negotiable and set up automatic withdrawals to avoid temptation,” he says.

Mr. Carrick also views automatic contributions as the key to a successful investing plan. If you save only when you have the money handy, you run the risk of never saving or not saving enough, he says.

Mr. Carrick recommends setting up an automatic transfer from your bank account to your savings or investment account that happens immediately after your paycheque is deposited. He suggests starting with a small amount that’s comfortable – perhaps 10 per cent of your net pay – and increasing the contributions as you can, such as when you get a raise or a higher-paying job. “One of the great benefits of automatic saving is that you never have to think about saving,” he notes. “Saving becomes so routine you may stop noticing that you’re doing it at all.”

If you’re into apps and fun math tricks, you can also sign up for tools like Wealthsimple’s Roundup, which links to your bank account, tracks the purchases you make with your debit or credit card, rounds them up to the nearest dollar and moves the difference into your investments.

As for actual dollar amounts, it depends on your situation and where you want to invest. Some robo-advisers, for example, have no minimum account balance, and will start investing your money with as little as $100 or $1,000. You can also find no-fee high-interest savings accounts to get your nest egg started.

It’s important to be clear about your intentions for investing: What are you trying to achieve, and why?iStockPhoto / Getty Images

How to make an investment plan

If the first step in investing is finding the money, the second is figuring out what to do with it.

It’s important to be clear about your intentions for investing, Mr. Brown says: What are you trying to achieve, and why? This comes alongside understanding the risks that come with investing and how comfortable you are with them.

Mr. Brown suggests creating an investment policy statement, or IPS. You can do this on your own or with the help of a professional. The IPS is your investing road map. It will include things like your objectives, your risk tolerance, your liquidity requirements and any other personal factors. The idea is to create a plan that will help you reach your goals without getting sidetracked.

Look for low-fee investing options (including apps)

“All investors need to be fee-conscious,” Mr. Carrick writes. “The less you pay, the more you keep from the returns generated by your investments.”

When choosing an investment vehicle, it’s important to be clear about what fees are involved, both in buying and selling and in maintaining the account. This is especially pertinent to investors with smaller account balances, for whom a flat fee of $10 for a trade or $25 for account maintenance can really make a dent in the total amount invested.

Mr. Carrick suggests a few options for low-fee investing:

Use an app: Free investing apps such as Wealthsimple Trade and TD Goal Assist, which offer no-cost options. Go robo: Robo-advisers, which have low overall fees and are friendly to investors with small balances. Try online: Online brokers such as Questrade and Scotia iTrade, which have no-fee options when buying exchange-traded funds.

Paying investment fees that are too high, Mr. Carrick notes, can eat into your returns to such an extent that you might have to work for years longer to make up the difference, which is why it’s key to be on top of the issue from day one.

DIY is split into two categories: robo-advisers and self-directed investing. Robo-advisers offer a “set it and forget it” approach while self-directed investing involves a lot more hands-on effort.iStockPhoto / Getty Images

Robo-advisers vs. self-directed investing: Pick the investment tool that works for you

As online investing tools have become more common, do-it-yourself investing has turned into an extremely popular option, especially among younger people without a lot of money to invest. Because DIY investing is low-cost, it is ideal for people just starting out.

DIY is basically split into two categories: robo-advisers and self-directed investing.

Robo-advisers offer a “set it and forget it” approach, whereby you create a personal investing profile and start depositing cash and the system chooses what to buy and when.

Self-directed investing, on the other hand, involves a lot more hands-on effort : You set up an account, choose what to buy and when, and make the purchases yourself. While some people do all the research on their own, too, others might hire a for-fee financial adviser to set up a plan for them, or follow a recommended portfolio online.

Another consideration is whether to use something like a tax-free savings account or an RRSP, and if so, which one to choose. In general, investors with lower income are better off focusing on their TFSA, while those in higher income brackets will get more benefit from RRSP contributions.

This is because of differences in income tax treatment. With an RRSP, you get a tax break when you contribute, but have to pay income tax when you pull the money out later, usually during retirement. With a TFSA, you’re contributing with after-tax income, which means no bonus tax refund now – but no tax to pay later. The idea is you want to pay the tax at the time when your income (and tax rate) is lower, which generally means during retirement for those with big salaries, and now for those just starting out.

Remember that TFSAs and RRSPs are investment buckets, not investments per se – you use them as a container to hold the investments you buy.

So what should you buy? It’s tempting to look for the next hot stock or up-and-coming industry. But for most investors, Mr. Carrick says, the best approach is to keep things simple. That means using diversified portfolios with a mix of stocks and bonds or guaranteed investment certificates that reflect your age, your investing needs and your comfort level with the potentially sharp ups and downs of the stock market.

That might still seem complicated, but Mr. Carrick breaks it down to two options that he defines as “easy and easier.”

The first is self-directed investing, as mentioned above. In this case, he suggests using your investment account to purchase an asset allocation ETF, which is a fully diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds and, occasionally, a dash of cryptocurrency. This is a low-cost, all-in-one option – you only need to buy one thing and all the diversification is built in. “A lifetime’s successful investing could easily be based on pouring money into a balanced ETF for several decades,” Mr. Carrick says.

The even easier option, he adds, is to sign up with a robo-adviser. They cost slightly more than self-directed investing, but that’s because they offer additional value to you in terms of support and guidance. Robo-advisers will also put your money into a diversified portfolio of ETFs (and occasionally other kinds of investments) that are chosen based on your personal investing profile.

Potential first-time buyers are holding back even though property prices are falling. Some are waiting to see how low house prices will go, while others cannot afford higher mortgage repayments on large loan balances, experts say.

New loans to first home buyers in Victoria fell to their lowest level since April 2019 — when the market was last in a downturn — this July, the latest month for which Australian Bureau of Statistics figures are available.

AMP Capital chief economist Dr Shane Oliver said first home buyers were leaving the market because of rising interest rates, while house price falls were not big enough to offset the rise in mortgage repayments."

First-time buyers have weeks left to apply for Help to Buy scheme - how it works explained

First-time buyers have just weeks left to apply for the Help to Buy scheme before it closes for good.

Help to Buy allows savers to purchase a house using a Government equity loan to help with the deposit.

The idea is that you can have a smaller deposit and still get on the property ladder - although the equity loan from the Government needs to be paid back, with interest.

You need to have a 5% deposit to use the scheme, with the Government then lending you up to 20% of the property price, or 40% in London.

But the scheme is closing for applications at 6pm on October 31, with Help to Buy ending on March 31, 2023 - unless it gets extended.

Since 2013, just shy of 340,000 homes have been bought using the equity loan scheme.

We explain how Help to Buy works - and what other support is out there for first-time buyers.

Help to Buy explained

Help to Buy is only available on new-build properties and there are maximum property values set for different parts of England.

For example, the maximum property price for buying in the north east of England is £186,100, rising to £600,000 if you’re buying in London.

This particular scheme is only available if buying a home in England, but a similar version is also available in Wales.

Here is a breakdown of the regional price caps from highest to lowest:

London: £600,000

South East: £437,600

East of England: £407,400

South West: £349,000

East Midlands: £261,900

West Midlands: £255,600

Yorkshire and The Humber: £228,100

North West: £224,400

North East: £186,100

You'll have to start paying interest on the loan after five years, at a rate of 1.75%, so keep in mind this added cost to your repayments.

Other first-time buyer schemes

With a Lifetime ISA (LISA) account, you can get a free 25% cash boost from the Government if you're saving for your first home or retirement.

You can save up to £4,000 each tax year, meaning the maximum bonus you can pocket is £1,000.

The maximum bonus is £33,000 if you open it at 18, and max it out until you turn 50 - you can’t pay into a LISA beyond the age of 50.

Anyone who is aged 18 to 39 can open a Lifetime ISA for free - and if you're in a couple, you can open one each.

You'll pay a penalty and lose your bonus if you take money out of your LISA account for anything other than your first home or retirement.

Help to Buy ISA accounts closed to new savers on November 30, 2019 - but if you’ve already opened an account, you can keep saving until November 30, 2029.

You must also claim your bonus by December 1, 2030.

When they first launched, you could open an account with a maximum of £1,200 but after that you're limited to saving £200 a month into it.

The government then tops up your savings with a 25% bonus - the maximum you can get free is £3,000, and you'd need to save £12,000 to get this.

Through this initiative, savers can put down a 5% deposit and the government acts as a guarantor if they miss a payment.

But, while the scheme is marketed at first-time buyers, it’s not just limited to those hoping to get on the ladder for the first time.

Guarantor mortgages will be available to anyone buying a property costing up to £600,000, unless they are investing in buy-to-let or second homes.

Critics of the scheme point out that you’ll save money in the long-run if you can afford a bigger mortgage.

Some lenders also offer 5% mortgages outside of the government-backed scheme that may be cheaper for borrowers.

This is where you buy a share of a property - between 25% and 75% of the property value - and pay rent on the rest.

The share you can buy is usually between 25% and 75% but can be as low as 10% on some homes.

You can buy additional amounts under what's known as “staircasing” which is where you slowly increase the amount of the property you own.

Shared ownership isn’t limited to first-time buyers, but to be eligible, you need to have an individual income no greater than £80,000 a year or £90,000 a year in London.

Your combined income can't be greater than these caps if you're buying as a couple."
d2051538-7646-471e-92f2-aa1751e15a2e,"Many first-home buyers hoped they would finally get a chance at the Australian dream when big banks forecast the biggest property price plunges in history earlier this year.

But their optimism was short lived.

Housing affordability is rapidly worsening as the sheer pace of interest rate hikes squeezes buyer borrowing power much faster than home prices can realistically fall.

In a speech on Monday, Reserve Bank head of domestic markets Jonathan Kearns revealed the size of mortgage buyers can afford fell a staggering 20 per cent in the past five months – since the RBA began its record streak of rate hikes to curb inflation.

“A lot of media attention is placed on the increase in existing borrowers’ repayments when interest rates increase,” Dr Kearns said.

“But higher interest rates also reduce the maximum loan size for prospective borrowers looking to purchase housing.”

From bad to worse for buyers

Against this backdrop, first-home buyers have rapidly retreated from the market.

The pandemic sparked a massive boom in new buyers rushing to buy amid huge public subsidies and record-low interest rates, but that trend has unravelled – big time.

The latest official data showed the number of first-home buyer loans fell below decade averages in July – down a whopping 48 per cent – from an earlier peak in January 2021.

And who could blame them? The maths are brutal.

Over the past three months average capital city house prices fell just 3.4 per cent, according to CoreLogic figures, after they rose more than 20 per cent over two years to 2022.

That pales in comparison to a 20 per cent squeeze on borrowing power.

So, while houses are now cheaper, the loans people can afford are much smaller. That shakes out into an affordability squeeze for many.

In fact, the proportion of median household income required to service a new home loan is set to reach 56 per cent very soon – a record high – according to new analysis from Barrenjoey.

“In the very near term the rapid rise in interest rates (both fixed and floating) is expected to outweigh falling house prices,” analysts at the investment firm said.

Still opportunities: Broker

Despite the shrinking borrowing power for buyers, mortgage broker and Zippy Financial director Louisa Sanghera said there are still opportunities in the market.

“First-home buyers have backed off,” she said.

“Rising interest rates scare them … but to be honest, we’re still getting them through [to a home loan].”

“As long as they’ve got a deposit together, we’re not having too many issues.”

Ms Sanghera said lenders, particularly those outside the big four banks, were still willing to extend sizeable home loans to first-time buyers, despite rising rates.

But you need to stick to your budget and, perhaps, consider looking further out from the major city centres.

“They might not be able to get in on the northern beaches [of Sydney], but they’ll be able to buy a property on the upper north shore,” Ms Sanghera said.

“You’ve got to buy to budget.”"

Interested entities should discuss STOs with SFC

This charge is one of the products of a series of recent meetings held by relevant agencies. Representatives of the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB), the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), and Invest Hong Kong held discussions with industry experts on the development of STOs in the country.

The meetings which the agencies held on September 14th and 16th followed previous discussions with virtual asset entities in August.

Elizabeth Wong, Director of Licensing and Head of FinTech Unit at the SFC stressed the agency’s support of the digital asset industry. Furthermore, Wong noted that the SFC’s support extends to the use of digital ledger technology (DLT) for offering securities.

According to Wong, the use of DLT in offering securities promotes transparency, efficiency and cost-effectiveness. She further debunked some misrepresentations of the FSC’s principles regarding securities. Additionally, Wong stated that interested entities should discuss STOs with the FinTech unit of the SFC.

Hong Kong government is ramping up measures to oversee digital assets

Speaking in the meeting, Joseph Chan, Under Secretary of the FSTB noted that Hong Kong is already home to several STOs. The recent guideline is an attempt at establishing proper oversight in the scene.

Chan highlighted the Hong Kong government’s readiness to enact measures that will contribute to the growth of the FinTech industry. He acknowledged that the FinTech sector is crucial in the development of the broader economy of Hong Kong.

We support the sustainable development of STO business in Hong Kong that meets the relevant regulatory and compliance requirements particularly on ensuring investor protection and addressing the risk on the anti-money laundering/combating of terrorist-financing aspect, Chan added.

Due to a recent surge in adoption rate, the Hong Kong government has ramped up measures to oversee the digital asset industry. In addition, institutions are showing increasing interest in the scene.

The banks – Bank of America, Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs – as lead underwriters for the funding package only managed to offload $US8.55 billion of bonds and loans at big discounts. They on-sold the debt at an effective yield of about 10 per cent, and were forced to retain about $US6.5 billion of the loans they had hoped to on-sell in their own balance sheets.

The heavy discounts they had to offer left them with about $US600 million in the red, according to Bloomberg. The funding package was used to help finance the buyout of US software group Citrix Systems by private equity firms Vista Equity Partners and Elliott Investment Management.

By Matt Tracy

(Reuters) - When U.S. consumer products company Newell Brands Inc refinanced $1.1 billion worth of bonds earlier this month, it saw its borrowing costs jump by more than half.

The maker of Sharpie pens and Rubbermaid storage containers agreed to pay annual interest of between 6.4% and 6.6%, up from the 3.9% annual coupon it was paying, in exchange for pushing back the bonds' maturity by four and six years.

Newell Brands had seven months left until it had to pay back the principal on these bonds and could have held out in the hopes of a cheaper debt deal. But with the Federal Reserve rushing to raise interest rates to combat rampant inflation, it made sense for the Atlanta, Georgia-based company to refinance now, credit ratings agency Moody's Investors Service Inc said in a note. Newell Brands is rated Ba1 by Moody's.

A Newell Brands spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. The company said in its latest quarterly earnings in July that it was betting on strong cash generation in the second half of 2022, driven by less spending on inventory, to help pay down its debt.

With a debt mountain net of cash of close to $5 billion and projected negative free cash flow this year of about $300 million, Newell Brands is one of hundreds of U.S. companies with overstretched balance sheets.

Many of these companies binged on cheap debt in the past 15 years and are now confronted with higher borrowing costs as a result of central banks tightening their monetary policies. This is restricting their ability to hire and retain employees, as well as invest in their business and return capital to shareholders.

The companies under the greatest strain are prolific users of debt rated as ""highly speculative"" by credit ratings agencies. Asset manager AllianceBernstein estimates that the average company with a B3 or B- rating -- highly speculative in credit rating agency parlance -- could see an 80% or more reduction of their free cash flow because of the decline in the junk debt markets.

Story continues

""Our belief is that a large number of B3 rated companies, by virtue of higher interest rates and deterioration of earnings, will become severely free cash flow-constrained,"" said Scott Macklin, director of leveraged loans at AllianceBernstein.

Moody's analyzed 208 B3-rated companies in June and found that 124 of them saw their free cash flow turn from positive to negative this year. Those funded by loans that have floating interest rates are more vulnerable, Moody's analysts said.

Jessica Gladstone, associate managing director at Moody's and co-author of the report, said bigger companies have more funding options and have been able to secure some fixed-rate financing at less onerous rates. But most companies with junk-rated debt have significant exposure to higher interest rates.

""If we're talking about the typical six times cash flow-leveraged, private equity-owned, all-loans and relatively small B3 company, the vast majority of them are going to see a very significant hit to their cash flow,"" Gladstone said.

HIGHER BANKRUPTCY RISK

The burden of higher interest payments is expected to lead to more companies filing for bankruptcies. Moody's projects that 3.7% of companies with junk-rated debt will file for bankruptcy by August 2023, up from 2.1% a year earlier.

Among the highly indebted companies facing this bankruptcy risk are healthcare provider Surgery Center Holdings, dentistry operator Heartland Dental, energy infrastructure servicer Artera Services and collision repair provider Wand NewCo 3, according to Moody's.

The vulnerability of these companies is partly due to floating-rate loans comprising a big chunk of their debt pile, according to Moody's.

Representatives for Surgery Center Holdings, Heartland Dental, Artera Services and Wand NewCo 3 did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

While most of the debt-laden companies will remain afloat in the short term, they will have to adjust to higher borrowing costs moving forward. Jeremy Burton, portfolio manager for high-yield bonds and leveraged loans at asset manager PineBridge Investments, said this will be an adjustment many companies will struggle with.

With interest rates having gone up ""materially"" in recent months, issuers are ""probably going to need to come in at a discount"" with new debt, Burton said.

Markets are fully priced for a rise in interest rates of 75 basis points from the Federal Reserve, with futures showing a 20 per cent chance of a full percentage point.

They also indicate a real chance that rates could hit 4.5 per cent as the Fed is forced to tip the economy into recession to subdue inflation.

""Asset performance during this Fed tightening cycle is very different from the norm for other rate hike episodes,"" said David Chao, a global market strategist at Invesco.

""Usually, the Fed tightens when the economy is thriving and most assets do well. However, most assets have suffered this time, perhaps due to the surge in inflation and abrupt policy change.""

Trading was thinned on Monday with British markets closed for Queen Elizabeth II's state funeral, but Europe's STOXX index slid 0.5 per cent to its lowest level in two months, dragged down by tech stocks.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.6 per cent, continuing to set new two-year lows, also hurt by declining tech stocks.

S&P 500 futures dipped 0.67 per cent, while Nasdaq futures fell 0.83 per cent.

As well as the specific rate hike, investors will be watching Fed members' ""dot plot"" forecasts for rates, which are likely to be hawkish, putting the funds rate at four to 4.25 per cent by the end of this year, and even higher next year.

That risk saw two-year Treasury yields surge 30 basis points last week alone to reach the highest since 2007 at 3.92 per cent, so making stocks look more expensive in comparison and dragging the S&P 500 down almost five per cent for the week.

Treasuries are not yet trading, as both Japan and Britain have public holidays, but euro zone borrowing costs edged higher, with the short-dated yields not far off their multi-year highs.

It is not just in the US that interest rate rises are expected. Most of the banks meeting this week - from Switzerland to South Africa - are expected to hike, with markets split on whether the Bank of England will go by 50 or 75 basis points.

China's central bank went its own way, though, and cut a repo rate by 10 basis points to support its ailing economy, leaving blue chips up 0.1 per cent.

The other exception is the Bank of Japan, which has shown no sign of abandoning its uber-easy yield curve policy despite the drastic slide in the yen.

The dollar rose 0.34 to 143.45 yen on Monday, having backed away from the recent 24-year peak of 144.99 in the face of increasingly strident intervention warnings from Japanese policymakers.

The euro was 0.36 per cent lower at $US0.9978 ($A1.4881), and sterling slipped 0.3 per cent to $US1.1390 ($A1.6987) just off Friday's 37-year lows, with traders keeping an eye on new British finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng's emergency mini-budget, expected Friday.

The dollar index, which measures the currency against six counterparts, was 0.4 per cent stronger at 110.03.

""We expect the USD to keep trending higher this week to a new cyclical high above 110.8pts because of the deteriorating outlook for the world economy,"" said CBA analysts in a note.

The ascent of the dollar and yields has been a drag for gold, which was down 0.55 per cent $US1,666 ($A2,485) an ounce after hitting lows not seen since April 2020 last week.

Oil prices slid, pressured by the stronger dollar Brent crude fell 1.3 per cent to $US90.18 ($A134.50). US crude dropped 1.3 per cent, to $US83.97 ($A125.23)."

TOKYO, Sept 20 (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan is set to maintain ultra-low interest rates and its dovish policy guidance on Thursday, a decision that comes hours after its U.S. counterpart's expected big rate hike and could trigger a fresh bout of yen selling.

Markets are focusing on whether BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will offer stronger warnings on the yen's sharp falls or tweak his view the recent cost-push inflation will be short-lived.

""Japan's consumer inflation is perking up at a faster than expected pace, partly due to the weak yen. It's becoming hard for the BOJ to keep saying price rises will remain temporary,"" said Mari Iwashita, chief market economist at Daiwa Securities.

At a two-day policy meeting ending on Thursday, the BOJ is set to maintain its short-term rate target at -0.1% and that for 10-year government bond yields around 0%. Kuroda will hold a news conference after the meeting.

The BOJ's decision will come hours after the Fed concludes its Sept. 20-21 meeting. Market players expect the U.S. central bank to raise rates by at least 75 basis points.

""Major central banks like the Fed and the Bank of England are about to continue shrinking their balance sheets. That puts the BOJ's dovish stance further under the spot-light,"" Iwashita said. ""I don't think the dollar's uptrend is over.""

The country's fragile recovery has forced the BOJ to remain an outlier among a global wave of central banks tightening monetary policy to combat surging inflation.

While Kuroda echoed the government's warning against sharp yen moves, he has pledged to keep monetary policy ultra-loose to support the economy - comments critics say dilute the impact of government officials' jawboning to tame yen falls.

At the policy meeting, the BOJ is expected to end as scheduled a pandemic-relief funding scheme this month and discuss adjustments to a policy guidance that flags the COVID-19 pandemic as the top economic risk.

But the BOJ is likely to leave unchanged key parts of the guidance that promises to ramp up stimulus as needed, and keep interest rates at ""current or lower"" levels, sources have told Reuters. read more

83755058-9902-499c-ba86-fa7b39a66686,"Citi says that the Malaga analysts will work on the same transactions as their counterparts elsewhere in the bank. They will just be assigned to fewer of them and given compensatory time off if they have to work late or on weekends to meet deadlines. Executives also promise that those who thrive in the two-year program will be offered promotions, including the option to take on more demanding, higher-paying roles elsewhere.

“This is not something we have suddenly come out with. We are listening to what people are telling us,” says Maria Diaz del Rio, chief of staff for the Citi unit that is running the program. “The industry is trying to change the culture, but the new generations are going further.”

The ‘mummy track’

However, the Malaga analysts could easily find themselves on a co-ed version of the 1980s and 1990s “mummy track”, which sidetracked the careers of many women who wanted to balance parenting with demanding jobs. Highly educated women who reduced their hours suffered lasting harm to their long-term earnings relative to male colleagues. (A 2010 paper put the gap at 24 per cent after 10 years.) They also missed promotion opportunities, leaving them a choice between dead-end jobs or departure.

Sexism was part of it but even well-meaning banks, consultancies and law firms found it hard to offer the pioneering mothers on and off ramps to the traditional high-speed career path. Most financial institutions still struggle to retain and promote mid-career women and mummy track discrimination lawsuits persist. US law firm Morrison & Foerster settled one in March.

Similarly, despite periodic promises of reform, seven-day work weeks remain normal in investment banking. Younger recruits may want something different, but a tiny beach resort program is not going to change bosses’ expectations overnight. Participants risk resentment from co-workers as well as being permanently stigmatised as unserious.

To be fair, Citi is probably the Wall Street bank most likely to make such a flexible working program succeed. Chief executive Jane Fraser, the first woman to run one of the US giants, has personal experience with non-traditional working. She went part-time at consulting firm McKinsey when her children were small. She has also called the pandemic recovery period a “once-in-a-generation opportunity for companies to redefine their workplaces”.

Diaz del Rio believes Malaga is the beginning of a wider cultural shift. “I think London, Frankfurt and Madrid are going to get closer to Málaga than Málaga will get to them,” she says.

Maybe this is the wave of the Gen Z future. But Goldman received record applications for its much harder core entry-level jobs last year, and UK bankers have praised the new government’s plan to lift the cap on bonuses because it will allow them to compress salaries while rewarding high-flyers. With investment banking fees falling and a recession in the offing, the pressure on juniors to prove their worth will only grow.

The Wall Street bank has set up a new branch for junior investment bankers in Málaga, the capital of the province of the same name on Spain’s southern Mediterranean coast. Temperatures in the seaside city rarely drop below 38ºF in the winter or exceed 97ºF in the summer.

Citi received more than 3,000 applications from graduates of top universities in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the Asia-Pacific region and Latin America. The 27 junior analysts chosen represent 22 nationalities and speak 15 different languages, including English, which will be the branch’s main idiom for doing business. After two years, they will be able to apply to work elsewhere within the bank.

Most of the new hires are between the ages of 22 and 26, with the oldest aged 32; the team is 59% male and 41% female. The group will be working to fulfill Citi’s strategy of aligning resources with sectors where it sees key growth: digital disruption, technology, health and wellness, sustainability revolution and energy transition.

“After considering distinct locations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, it was decided that the new group would be located in Málaga for its recognized capacity to attract and retain talent internationally,” Citi said in a statement. The office is situated in the center of the city, which is one of the oldest in Spain, having been founded by the Phoenicians around 770 B.C.

Related: No more New York: People are trying to flee the Empire State for warmer destinations. Here’s why.

Like many Spanish cities, Málaga boasts an efficient public transport system, with a metro, buses and trains.

Manolo Falcó, global co-head of investment banking, told the Financial Times that this was not just a gimmick to draw in young candidates. “We suffer from a lot of churn like the rest of the industry, we lose talent to private equity and tech, so we are eager to understand if we can stop that by offering a better work-life balance,” he said.

A survey of 200 junior bankers by the tech group UpSlide, provided to Financial News last month, revealed that 72% of them were ready to quit over burnout. That comes a year after a group of unhappy Goldman Sachs analysts claimed “inhumane” 100-hour workweeks in a PowerPoint presentation.

Entry-level salaries reportedly have climbed 30% to $110,000 over the past year at many of the bigger firms, with weekend work limited and more vacation time doled out, according to Financial News.

Citi is also one of several major Wall Street banks to extend travel benefits to employees seeking abortions in other states in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in June 2022 to strike down Roe v. Wade, ending the constitutional right to abortion.

Despite the moves to encourage investment bankers, talk of layoffs at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and other banks has increased after a sharp drop in deal making.

04d5940a-0dd8-46b0-95a3-a62cfa2cb401,"The Federal Court of Victoria, Australia, has ratified a $7.2 million penalty against Dixon Advisory and Superannuation Services for failing to act in its clients' best interests and provide advice that was appropriate for its clients' circumstances.

Two years ago, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission sued Dixon Advisory for violating the Corporation Act and accused six of the advisory's firm representatives of being involved. The corporate regulator claimed that Dixon Advisory failed to consider the conflict of interests between clients and entities associated with a predecessor firm, Evans Dixon, and that capital loss resulted from that negligence. In July 2021, Dixon Advisory entered into an agreement to resolve ASIC's civil penalty proceedings and admitted to a number of allegations three months later.

""There is no evidence that the [Dixon Advisory] representatives conducted the necessary reasonable investigations into the recommended financial products or any alternative financial products, nor is there evidence that they considered the personal circumstances of the clients,"" said Justice Timothy McEvoy in a statement. ""The contraventions were not the result of isolated or unauthorized conduct of the representatives. Six representatives committed the contraventions over a period spanning some three and a half years.""

Established in 2011 by Dixon Advisory, the U.S. Masters Residential Property Fund exposed investors to the U.S. residential property market by investing in New York City real estate. On 53 occasions between October 2015 and May 2019, Dixon representatives failed to act in their clients' best interests and advised eight clients to acquire, roll over or retain interests in URF without investigating their background.

These practices allegedly caused some clients' self-managed superannuation funds to be insufficiently diversified and to lose a significant amount of assets. Brian Osborne was one of the many clients who lost hundreds of thousands of dollars by investing in URF, and Osborne believes that the court's decision was ""just a slap over the wrist.""

""I was waiting to see something substantial, with some sort of compensation to the investors who have lost large portions of their retirement,"" he told Financial Review .

In June 2019, the firm's vertical-integration model started receiving negative attention after several clients said they were being encouraged to sometimes invest more than half of their savings in shares, hybrids and debt tied to the U.S. property fund. According to ASIC, the fund paid Dixon $136 million in fees between September 2015 and June 2018, thus accounting for almost two-thirds of Dixon Advisory's revenue at some point. Before its collapse, Dixon Advisory was Australia's fourth largest self-managed superfund provider and offered wealth management services to over 5,000 clients.

Despite Dixon's efforts to create a renovation program, the overcapitalized fund still performed poorly and continued to charge clients expensive fees. The company was criticized for leading clients into risky investments, and discussions got even more heated when URF stocks fell 50% between 2017 and 2019. Eventually, Dixon Advisory's issues with URF culminated in the departure of former CEO Alan Dixon and the firm's merger with David Evans' Evans & Partners in 2017.

""Licensees need to ensure their representatives are taking into account their clients' specific needs and circumstances,"" said ASIC deputy chair Sarah Court. ""Advice that fails to reflect client circumstances — or advice models that lead to one-size-fits-all outcomes — are less likely to meet best interest duty obligations and can expose clients to a risk of capital loss.""

Last November, law firm Piper Alderman launched a class action lawsuit against Dixon Advisory for failing to act in its clients' best interests. The lawsuit alleged that Dixon's investment committee reviewed, approved and recommended which products were to be ""pushed on to group members"" whom the firm believed it could earn millions in fees from. The lawsuit came only weeks after Maurice Blackburn sued the company for causing a couple to lose almost $1 million in retirement savings, and a month before Shine Lawyers proceeded with its own class-action suit.

Dixon Advisory filed for voluntary administration in January and, on April 19, ASIC suspended its Australian Financial Services license. The court said that Dixon Advisory may resume providing financial services if it implements appropriate systems, policies and procedures to ensure its representatives act in their clients' best interests.

Stephen Longley and Craig Crosbie of PwC's Australia firm were jointly appointed as voluntary administrators of Dixon Advisory & Superannuation in January. Accounting Today reached out for comment, but has not yet heard back from the firm.

Many investors are also worried about a potential recession, adding to the stock market concerns. With all of this volatility, is it still safe to retire right now? Or should you hold off a few years? It depends on a few factors.

1. Is your asset allocation appropriate for your age?

Asset allocation refers to how your investments are divided up in your portfolio.

When you're younger, it's generally best to invest primarily in stocks, with little money allocated toward bonds and other conservative investments. While stocks are higher risk than bonds, they also see higher returns, on average. And if the stock market falls, you have plenty of time to let your investments recover.

As you get older, though, your portfolio should lean to the conservative side, more heavily allocated toward bonds and less to stocks. Bonds generally see lower returns than stocks, but they're also less affected by market volatility.

There's no set rule as to what your asset allocation should look like. A general rule of thumb, though, is to subtract your age from 110, and the result is the percentage of your portfolio that should be allocated to stocks. If you're 65 years old, for example, you may aim to allocate 45% of your portfolio toward stocks and 55% toward bonds.

2. How strong are your savings?

If your savings are falling short, it may be more challenging to retire. Even with proper asset allocation, your retirement fund could still lose value in the short term if the market is in a slump.

This is normal and not something to be overly concerned about, as the market will likely rebound eventually. However, it can sometimes take years for the market to fully recover from a downturn. If your savings are sparse to begin with and a downturn shrinks your retirement fund even more, your first couple of years in retirement could be more difficult.

How much you should save for retirement will depend on your unique situation. But your savings may need to last 20 years or more, so before you retire, it's wise to take a realistic look at whether you're on track.

3. How much can you depend on Social Security?

Social Security benefits can go a long way toward bridging the gap between what you have saved and what you need to retire comfortably.

If you haven't already, now is a great time to check your benefit amount online. You can do this by creating a mySocialSecurity account, where you'll see an estimate of your benefit amount based on your real earnings throughout your career.

Keep in mind that this is the amount you'll collect at your full retirement age (FRA). If you file before your FRA (as early as age 62), your payments will be smaller. On the other hand, if you delay Social Security past your FRA (up to age 70), you'll receive larger checks each month.

Social Security can be a significant source of income in retirement, and your checks won't be affected by stock market fluctuations. Depending on how much you're receiving, your benefits can make it easier to retire during periods of market volatility.

Market turbulence can be intimidating, but that doesn't mean you can't retire. By taking a few extra precautions to ensure you're ready, you can head into retirement as prepared as possible.

If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings.

All three major US stock indexes slid to levels not touched since mid-July, with the S&P 500 closing below 3,900, a closely watched support level.

Staggering past the finish line of a week rattled by inflation concerns, looming interest rate hikes and ominous economic warning signs, the S&P 500 suffered its worst weekly percentage plunge since June.

The Nasdaq is set for its biggest Friday-to-Friday drop since January while October 2020 was the last time the blue-chip Dow suffered a steeper weekly drop.

""It's been a tough week. It feels Halloween came early"" said David Carter, managing director at JPMorgan in New York.

""We are facing this toxic brew of high inflation, high interest rates and low growth, which isn't good for stock or bond markets.""

Risk-off sentiment went from simmer to boil after FedEx Corp's withdrawal of its earnings forecast late on Thursday, citing signs of dampening global demand.

FedEx's move followed remarks from the World Bank and the IMF, both of which warned of an impending worldwide economic slowdown.

A deluge of mixed economic data, dominated by a hotter than expected inflation report (CPI), cemented an interest rate hike of at least 75 basis points at the conclusion of the Fed's monetary policy meeting next week.

""While the market is expecting a big bump in the Fed's rates next week, there is tremendous uncertainty and concern about future rate increases,"" Carter added.

""The Fed is doing what it needs to do. And after some pain, markets and the economy will heal themselves.""

Wall Street noticed: FedEx stock fell more than 21% on Friday following the pre-earnings announcement. Shares are now down more than 37% year to date.

""FedEx preannounced the weakest set of results we've seen relative to expectations in our ~20 years of analyzing companies,"" Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to clients.

In a statement, the logistics company said it now expects fiscal first-quarter earnings, excluding some items, to come in at $3.44 per share, 30% below the $5.10 consensus estimate compiled by Bloomberg. The company announced it will cut flights, trim labor hours, and cancel network capacity projects to cushion the expected blow of reduced demand for the next several quarters.

The company's air cargo market has shifted as inflationary pressures, elevated inventory levels in the U.S., the war in Ukraine, and COVID-19 lockdowns in China present ongoing challenges for the market. Air cargo volumes in August fell 5% year-over-year, according to a news release from Clive Data Services last week.

“Based on FedEx's pre-announcement, the biggest hit to margin came in their air express unit, not the ground unit,"" equity research analyst Jordan Alliger said on the Goldman Sachs ""Making Logic of Logistics"" webinar on Friday, adding: ""That would imply that there could be some downshift — not necessarily absolute drops — in demand, maybe in total.""

For FedEx Express, the company’s time-definite delivery segment that uses cargo aircraft, revenue came in $500 million short of its revenue target.

""The company did say that revenue in this segment was $500 million short vs. its forecast; but the decremental margins associated with this should not be 100%,"" Deutsche Bank added. ""This implies a concerning inability to respond with cost mitigation, which we believe is more indicative of operating execution than macro forces. And this is not the first time we've observed weak execution from FedEx, but the magnitude of the numbers in today's release was simply staggering. We simply can't explain it, even after our discussions with the company this evening.""

Although many of FedEx's issues are specific to the company, Shanker believes this is the start of the post-pandemic unwind and cost pressures will add another leg to the risk.

""We believe a discount is merited given the decelerating core and fuel pricing support in Ground and Express, in addition to increasing risks of a recession,"" JPMorgan’s Brian Ossenbeck wrote in a note.

For tourists, a strong dollar is great news. It means you get more for your money abroad. But for investors, a beefed-up buck is decidedly bad news. ""When the dollar strengthens, that means foreign revenues are going to translate into fewer dollars. Those earnings are going to come in lower,"" says Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, adding that any overseas investment you own ""is going to hurt you in a rising dollar environment."" Here's why investing experts say a strong dollar could hurt your portfolio, and what you can potentially do about it.

How a strong dollar hurts your portfolio

A strong dollar crimps income that companies earn abroad, since money brought in in the form of weaker foreign currencies is converted into fewer dollars. The effect on your portfolio is directly related to your international exposure, which could be greater than you think. About 30% of revenues in the S&P 500 — a barometer for the broad U.S. stock market — come in from overseas, analysts at investing firm Evercore report. If you own a collection of international stocks — a commonly recommended way to diversify your portfolio — the drag on performance is even more apparent. ""U.S. investors who own international equities get punished by the strong dollar because they're not getting the benefits of a local market,"" says Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at investing analytics firm VettaFi. ""The dollar has significantly weakened the performance of international strategies this year."" Case in point: The MSCI EAFE Index, a benchmark for stocks from developed foreign countries, has surrendered more than 20% so far in 2022. A version of the index that strips out the effects of currency fluctuations has lost about 7.5%.

How to adjust your portfolio for a strong dollar"
5f27b949-c392-45c0-ac49-ade47fd7febe,"New York CNN Business —

Few investments have increased in value during this challenging year on Wall Street. But one asset that is in green in 2022 is literally green: the US dollar.

The greenback has soared this year thanks to the Federal Reserve jacking up interest rates to fight inflation and hopes that the US economy will prove to be more resilient than others around the world despite fears of recession.

The US Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar versus the British pound, euro, Swiss franc, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar and Swedish krona, has soared nearly 13% this year and is trading near its highest level since May of 2002.

With the dollar at a 20-year high, that will likely hurt earnings for US multinational giants. That’s because the strong dollar reduces the value of sales and earnings from their overseas operations.

Dow components Microsoft (MSFT) and Nike (NKE) have noted dollar strength as a problem in earnings calls during the past few months, for example.

“Currency volatility has accelerated and absolute valuations are at multidecade extremes. History is not kind to such a backdrop,” said Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer and head of the global investment office of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, in a report Monday.

“While the dollar helps the Fed fight inflation, it also threatens US corporate earnings through foreign profit translation and a deterioration in competitiveness,” she added.

The strong dollar could lead to a further pullback in oil prices, since crude (like other commodities) trades in dollars. Lower energy costs would obviously be welcome news to consumers around the globe who are struggling to pay bills because of inflation.

Stronger dollar has some benefits to go along with major drawbacks

But oil stocks are, by far, the best-performing sector this year. So if energy prices continue to slide (crude prices are down nearly 5% in the past month) then that could be bad news for the broader market.

“We want to believe that the [dollar] rally cannot continue forever, because a dollar this strong is also a growing headache for the US itself,” said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst with Swissquote Bank, in a report last week.

“The stronger dollar should have a negative impact on US exports, making US goods less affordable for the others, especially given that the world is struggling with a sharp decline in purchasing power,” she added. “If the dollar continues rising at this speed…the US economy will also hit a wall.”

The surging dollar has also hurt gold, which is down about 6% this year, as well as bitcoin and other cryptos. Despite a recent rebound in bitcoin to about $22,000, bitcoin prices have been cut by more than half this year. Simply put, investors don’t need precious metals or crypto as a hedge to the dollar at a time when the dollar is king.

There is one positive from the strong dollar though. A healthy greenback provides more bang for American shoppers’ proverbial buck, if they are looking to buy imported goods or travel overseas.

“The benefits of a stronger dollar include a moderating influence on inflation here at home…and greater purchasing power for U.S. companies and consumers abroad,” said Tim Holland, chief investment officer at Orion Advisor Solutions, in a recent report.

Holland noted that a dollar and a euro are roughly at parity now. Back in 2008, just before the Great Recession and Global Financial Crisis, the euro peaked at a record level of above $1.60, a move that helped contribute to oil prices soaring to nearly $150 a barrel."

A modern currency must meet the needs of a modern economy. Yet in an important way, the US dollar is failing: As currencies around the world become more user-friendly, it’s in danger of falling behind. The Federal Reserve is rightly working to remedy this, but the broader government must do more to ensure that the dollar remains competitive, within the country’s borders and beyond.

In recent decades, countries ranging from the UK to China have introduced payment systems enabling people to transact instantly, directly from their bank accounts and at extremely low cost, with everyone from friends to the phone company. By one estimate, this transition to real-time payments has boosted global economic output by $78 billion a year — meaning faster paychecks, smoother transactions and generally accelerated commerce.

Not so much in the US. Less than 1% of all transactions settle in real time. The fastest retail payment systems — such as Venmo and Zelle — have only limited uses or coverage. Bank transfers can still take days to process, with all the frustration, expense and risk that entails. Card payments, albeit relatively convenient, incur merchant fees as high as 3%, amounting to tens of billions of dollars a year in added costs that consumers ultimately pay.

Advertisement

To its credit, the Fed is trying to address at least part of the problem: the country’s outdated “automated clearinghouse,” which processes by far the largest share of payments by value — more than $70 trillion in 2021 — but only in batches and during weekday business hours. In mid-2023, the central bank intends to launch a new service called FedNow, which will operate around the clock. If successful, it will complement and expand upon existing private services, enabling a wide range of instant payments among financial institutions, businesses and consumers.

So far, so good. But the rest of the world isn’t standing still.

Consider international payments. Governments can facilitate trust between banks within their territories, but things become more complicated across borders. Payments often need to travel convoluted paths among banks that have established correspondent relationships, adding delay, risk and expense. Workarounds such as Wise or Western Union don’t fully address the issue. The typical international remittance fee, for example, is about 5%, extracting billions of dollars a year from people sending money to family and friends.

One promising solution, borrowed from cryptocurrencies: Create a true digital form of cash. This could come in various forms, such as regulated versions of stablecoins tied to fiat currencies, or tokens issued directly by central banks. Much like bearer instruments, these wouldn’t require trust. They could be exchanged on platforms that transcend borders, making international transactions fast, secure and cheap. Among others, the central banks of Australia, China, France, Singapore and Switzerland have tested such platforms, and the International Monetary Fund is advocating a more robust version to connect payment systems worldwide.

The US hasn’t been entirely idle in this respect. The Fed has been exploring the possibility of a digital dollar — and to some extent, the issuer of the world’s dominant currency can afford to wait and learn from the experience (and mistakes) of others. That said, policy makers need to ensure that the US helps shape whatever legitimate payment infrastructure emerges. To that end, regulators should get a grip on stablecoins, insisting that any token purporting to be worth a dollar be backed by actual dollars. And Congress should grant the Fed the authority to issue a central bank digital currency if needed.

The next iteration of money has the potential to benefit billions, enhance global trade, and broaden access for previously marginalized people and places. The US shouldn’t allow itself to fall behind again.

The value of the U.S. dollar has been on a tear for more than a year against everything from the British pound across the Atlantic to the South Korean won across the Pacific.

After rising again Friday, the dollar is near its highest level in more than two decades against a key index measuring six major currencies, including the euro and Japanese yen. Many professional investors don’t expect it to ease off anytime soon.

The dollar’s rise affects nearly everyone, even those who will never leave the U.S. borders. Here’s a look at what’s driving the U.S. dollar higher and what it can mean for investors and households:

What does it mean to say the dollar is stronger?

Essentially that one dollar can buy more of another currency than it could before.

Consider the Japanese yen. A year ago, $1 could get a little less than 110 yen. Now, it can buy 143. That’s about 30% more and one of the biggest moves the U.S. dollar has made against another currency.

Foreign currency values are constantly shifting against each other as banks, businesses and traders buy and sell them in time zones around the world.

The U.S. Dollar index, which measures the dollar against the euro, yen and other major currencies, has climbed more than 14% this year. The gain looks even more impressive compared against other investments, most of which have had a dismal year. U.S. stocks are down more than 19%, bitcoin has more than halved and gold has lost more than 7%.

Why is the dollar strengthening?

Because the U.S. economy is doing better than others.

Even though inflation is high, the U.S. job market has remained remarkably solid. And other areas of the economy, such as the services sector, have been resilient.

That’s helped offset worries about a slowing housing industry and other parts of the economy that do best when interest rates are low. That in turn has traders expecting the Federal Reserve to follow through on its promise to keep hiking interest rates sharply, and to hold them there a while, in hopes of knocking down the worst inflation in 40 years.

Such expectations have helped the yield of a 10-year Treasury more than double to 3.44% from roughly 1.33% a year ago.

Who cares about bond yields?

Investors who want to make more income off their money. And those juicier U.S. yields are drawing investors from all over the world.

Other central banks have been less aggressive than the Fed because their economies seem to be more fragile. The European Central Bank just raised its key rate by the largest amount ever, three-quarters of a percentage point. But the Fed has already raised its key rate by that amount twice this year, with a third expected this upcoming week. Some traders even say a gargantuan hike of a full percentage point could be possible, following a hotter-than-expected report on U.S. inflation Tuesday.

Partly because of that less aggressive bent, 10-year bonds across Europe and other areas of the world offer much lower yields than U.S. Treasurys, such as Germany’s 1.75% and Japan’s 0.25%. When investors from Asia and Europe buy Treasurys, they have to trade their own currencies for U.S. dollars. That pushes up the dollar’s value.

A strong dollar helps US tourists, right?

Yes. U.S. travelers in Tokyo spending 10,000 yen on dinner will be using 23% fewer dollars than a year ago for the same-priced meal.

With the dollar up sharply so far this year against everything from the Argentine peso to the Egyptian pound to the South Korean won, the dollar is going further in many countries than before.

Does it help only rich people who can afford to travel abroad?

No. A stronger dollar also helps U.S. shoppers by keeping a lid on prices for imports and pushing downward on inflation.

When the dollar is rising against the euro, for example, European companies make more euros on each $1 of sales. With that cushion, they could cut the dollar price for their products and still make the same amount of euros. They could also leave the price in dollars alone and pocket the extra euros, or they could find some balance of the two.

Prices for imports fell 1% in August from a month earlier, following July’s 1.5% drop, offering some relief amid the nation’s high inflation. Prices for imported fruits, nuts and some peels dropped 8.7%, for example. They’re down 3% from a year earlier.

A stronger dollar can keep prices in check for commodities generally. That’s because oil, gold and others are bought and sold in U.S. dollars around the world. When the dollar rises against the yen, a Japanese buyer can get fewer barrels of crude for the same number of yen as before. That can mean less upward pressure on oil prices.

So there are only winners from a strong dollar?

No. U.S. companies that sell abroad are seeing their profits get squeezed.

At McDonald’s, revenue fell 3% during the summer from a year earlier. But if the dollar’s value had simply stayed put against other currencies, the company’s revenue would have been 3% higher. Microsoft, meanwhile, said changes in foreign-currency values sliced $595 million off its revenue in the latest quarter.

A string of other companies have given similar warnings recently, and further gains for the dollar could add more pressure on profits. Companies in the S&P 500 index get roughly 40% of their revenue from outside the United States, according to FactSet.

Any other collateral damage?

A strong dollar can put a financial squeeze across the developing world. Many companies and governments in such emerging markets borrow money in U.S.-dollar terms, instead of in their own currencies. When they must repay their debts in U.S. dollars, while their own currencies buy fewer dollars by the day, it can create lots of stress.

Where’s the dollar heading from here?

The dollar’s biggest moves may be behind it, but many professionals expect the dollar to at least stay this high a while.

Tuesday’s report on U.S. inflation shocked the market and showed it remains more stubborn than expected. That has traders upping bets for Fed rate hikes going into next year. Fed officials have been busy recently reaffirming their commitment to keeping rates high “until the job is done” in breaking the nation’s high inflation, even if it damages economic growth.

That bias toward still-higher rates by the Fed should continue to offer support for the value of the U.S. dollar.

NEW YORK (AP) — The buck isn’t stopping.

With another jumbo rate hike on deck, investors worry the Fed risks a recession by going too far.

Here's what Stanley Druckenmiller, Jeff Gundlach and 4 other Fed watchers had to say.

A surprisingly hot US inflation number has galvanized Wall Street into taking stock of the Federal Reserve's efforts to cool it — and some investors aren't holding back.

The inflation shock last week has cemented in the view the Fed will raise interest rates by at least 75 basis points at its meeting next week.But it will mean yet another oversized increase from the central bank for its fifth rate hike this year.

There are worries the Fed's paying too much attention to inflation data releases, because they don't reflect what's happening at the time.

That lag means policymakers run the risk of overtightening, at a point when the economy needs some relief — and that would hit stocks hard.

Here what six straight-talking investors and Fed watchers say about its interest-rate campaign and the chances it will cause pain for the economy and markets.

1. Stanley Druckenmiller: The Fed's abrupt shift after years of easy money signals a bleak outlook for stocks.

""Now they're like reformed smokers,"" Druckenmiller said. ""They've gone from printing a bunch of money, like driving a Porsche at 200 miles an hour, by not only taking the foot off the gas, but just slamming the brakes on,"" he said.

""There's a high probability in my mind that the market, at best, is going to be kind of flat for 10 years,"" the billionaire investor said.

2. Jeff Gundlach: Fed policymakers are on the brink of going too far with tightening.

""I've been saying for a long time that the Fed does nothing but follows the 2-year Treasury yield. Now they are catching up the Fed Funds rate to that level,"" the DoubleLine CEO said on a recent podcast, the company tweeted.

""Unfortunately, looks like the Fed might overtighten,"" Gundlach said.

""The Fed is getting aggressive to the point that they oversteer the economy into the dumpster,"" added Gundlach, whose nickname is ""Bond King"".

3. Barry Sternlicht: More jumbo rate hikes from the Fed will spark a US recession and a housing crash.

""If the Fed keeps this up, they are going to have a serious recession and people will lose their jobs,"" billionaire real-estate investor Sternlicht said.

""You are going to see cracks everywhere,"" he added.

The Fed ""is attacking the economy with a sledge hammer [when] they don't need to,"" the Starwood Capital Group boss said.

4. Nassim Taleb: Zero interest rates have hurt the economy, and now we need to get back to normal.

""We've had 15 years, 14 and a half years of Disneyland that basically has destroyed the economic structure. Think about it: No interest rates,"" Taleb, author of ""The Black Swan"", said.

""At zero interest rates … for long periods of time, you are hurting the economy. You're creating bubbles, creating tumors like bitcoin, creating hedge funds that should not exist, but have existed for 15 years.""

""So now we need to go back to normal economic life. People with experience remember that there was at some point such a thing as a discount rate … that your investment had to earn cash flow,"" the former options trader said.

5. Mark Spitznagel: The Fed's hikes risk sparking an asset slump and tipping the economy into a devastating recession.

""If the Fed's going to try to normalize rates, they're going to bring inflation down very, very quickly, but it's also going to cause devastation,"" the cofounder of Universa Investments said.

""The controlled burn can turn into a wildfire cascade,"" Spitznagel said about the Fed's tightening plan.

""That is the real risk here. And that's what investors need to think about — not the type of losses that occurred this year, but rather the type of losses that this can turn into. Where the Fed actually can't do anything to stop it.""

""We should really worry more about deflation. That's a huge, huge risk people are not thinking about. If the Fed pops this bubble, we will be in a deflationary spiral.""

6. David Rosenberg: The Fed is too focused on inflation data, when it should give the economy a break from hikes.

""I'd be pausing right now and assessing the tightening that's already been put into the system,"" the chief economist of Rosenberg Research said. ""We're talking incessantly about inflation, but the economy is flat on its back right now.""

""They're raising rates and reducing the size of the balance sheet in a rather dramatic fashion into an inverted yield curve. And that is going to sow the seeds of a recession, if we're not already in one."""
ed91dbec-969e-4d79-b5d3-83b1f5019c5c,"After a hotter-than-expected inflation reading spooked investors on Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average sank over 1,200 points in the stock market’s worst showing since June 2020.

That same day, Stanley Druckenmiller, one of Wall Street’s most respected minds, argued that the pain won’t be temporary—and that stocks face an entire decade of sideways trading as the global economy goes through a tectonic shift.

“There’s a high probability in my mind that the market, at best, is going to be kind of flat for 10 years, sort of like this ’66 to ’82 time period,” he said in an interview with Alex Karp, CEO of software and A.I. firm Palantir.

Druckenmiller added that with inflation raging, central banks raising rates, deglobalization taking hold, and the war in Ukraine dragging on, he believes the odds of a global recession are now the highest in decades.

And given Druckenmiller’s track record, investors would be wise to heed his warnings.

The legendary investor founded his hedge fund, Duquesne Capital, in 1981, and routinely outperformed the majority of his peers on Wall Street over the coming decades, delivering an annual average return of 30% from 1986 to 2010, according to Yahoo Finance.

But Druckenmiller really made his name when he led George Soros’s bet against the British pound in 1992, helping the billionaire pocket a cool $1.5 billion profit in a single month.

Druckenmiller eventually shut down his hedge fund in 2010 and converted it into a family office—a type of private firm established by wealthy families to manage their money—as many hedge funders typically do when they unofficially retire. But the leading investor’s views are still widely followed on Wall Street.

Reformed smokers

Druckenmiller’s argument for why the stock market is facing a decade of “flat” trading is based on the idea that central banks’ policies are shifting around the world from a supportive to a restrictive stance.

This shift is a result of the globalization that characterized the past few decades fading amid the war in Ukraine and U.S.-China tensions. Druckenmiller points out that globalization has a deflationary effect because it increases worker productivity and speeds up technological advancement, but now that’s gone.

“When I look back at the bull market that we’ve had in financial assets really starting in 1982…all the factors that created that not only have stopped, they’ve reversed,” he said, referencing current de-globalization trends like the rift between the U.S. and China, along with a move toward increased government spending and more regulation since the 1980s.

Druckenmiller went on to explain how central banks responded to the disinflation caused by globalization since the 1980s—and particularly after the 2008 Great Financial Crisis—with unsustainable policies that now have to be reworked.

“The response after the global financial crisis to disinflation was zero rates, and a lot of money printing, quantitative easing. That created an asset bubble in everything,” he said.

Central bank officials around the world are now moving away from the near-zero interest rates and quantitative easing—a policy of buying mortgage-backed securities and government bonds in hopes of spurring lending and investment—that have bolstered financial assets over the past few decades.

“They’re like reformed smokers,” Druckenmiller said. “They’ve gone from printing a bunch of money, like driving a Porsche at 200 miles an hour, to not only taking the foot off the gas, but just slamming the brakes on.”

To his point, the U.S. Federal Reserve has raised rates four times this year to combat inflation, and it’s not the only central bank attempting to bring down consumer prices with tighter monetary policy. From the U.K. to Australia, central bankers around the world are shifting to a more conservative approach and raising interest rates.

While that means financial assets, including stocks, will likely underperform over the next decade in Druckenmiller’s view, there is some positive news.

“The nice thing is, there were companies that did very, very well in that environment back then,” Druckenmiller said, referencing the stock market’s flat trading seen between ’66 and ’82. “That’s when Apple Computer was founded, Home Depot was founded.”

Druckenmiller also gave a caveat for investors when it comes to his pessimistic outlook, saying that this is the most difficult time in history to make economic forecasts and that he has a history of a “bearish bias” that he has had to work around his whole career.

“I like darkness,” he said."
cb40d9c6-b363-49d2-bd46-88ddbff134dc,"Stanley Druckenmiller said there's a high probability of a flat stock market for 10 years.

That's because of a rollback in globalization and easy monetary policy.

The Fed has already hiked interest rates four times this year.

Billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller sees a bleak outlook for the stock market, and that there's a ""high probability"" of the stock market being flat for 10 years.

""There's a high probability in my mind that the market, at best, is going to be kind of flat for 10 years, sort of like this '66 to '82 time period,"" said Druckenmiller in a discussion with Alex Karp, the CEO of data company Palantir, according to a YouTube video uploaded on Tuesday.

One key change is the reversal of globalization that drove high productivity, contributing to disinflation. Central banks also adopted generally loose monetary policies since the Global Financial Crisis in 2008 to boost growth, but are now tightening their stance.

The Federal Reserve has implemented four interest rate hikes so this year and is likely to hike rates further to tame inflation.

""Now, they're like reformed smokers,"" Druckenmiller said of central banks. ""They've gone from printing a bunch of money, like driving a Porsche at 200 miles an hour, by not only taking the foot off the gas, but just slamming the brakes on,"" he added.

As a result, gains in the bullish stock market since 1982, which went into ""hyperdrive"" in the last decade, will likely taper off, said Druckenmiller, who is a former lead portfolio manager for George Soros' Quantum Fund.

Stock markets tend to fall when interest rates rise, as higher rates may hit company profits. This reduces the appeal of stocks versus assets like bonds, which are less risky.

Despite the doom and gloom, there could be an upside in a stagnant environment, said Druckenmiller.

""The nice thing is, there were companies that did very, very well in that environment back then,"" Druckenmiller said, referring to the period a flat stock market from 1966 to 1982. ""That's when Apple Computer was founded, Home Depot was founded."""
96ec8cc0-62e1-4020-b6c0-e178e9209f3a,"© Paul Morigi/Getty Images Warren Buffett's top investing advice is still valid but the S&P 500 is 'the worst thing to own' in the near term, says top US stock strategist

Investors should avoid the S&P 500 in the short term, according to the head of US equity and quantitative strategy at BofA Securities.

""If you're thinking about what's going to happen between now and let's say the next 12 months, I don't think the bottom is in,"" Savita Subramanian told CNBC.

The S&P 500 is the ""worst thing to own"" in the current high-inflation environment, unless investors have a long-term outlook, according to Bank of America Securities head of US equity and quantitative strategy.

Renowned billionaire Warren Buffet has often preached that average retail investors should buy and hold an index fund tracking the S&P 500.

""If you've got a 10-year time horizon, hold the S&P 500 and watch and wait. Returns are probably going to be in the mid-single digits for the next 10 years,"" Savita Subramanian told CNBC on Tuesday. ""But if you're thinking about what's going to happen between now and let's say the next 12 months, I don't think the bottom is in.""

She added that she likes the Buffett strategy of buying and holding, but not everybody is looking 10 years out.

In the short term, there is better value to be found outside of the S&P 500, pointing out that small-cap stock benchmarks are pricing a much deeper recession than she expects.

The US economy could even benefit from what appears to be the beginnings of a capital expenditure cycle, Subramanian said.

""The S&P 500 right now is expensive — it's super crowded. It's the most crowded ticker in the world if you think about it from an index perspective,"" she said, adding that ""while it might do well over the next 10 years, I do think that there is some crowding risk [and] some potential for investors to have to sell the S&P."""
5705500b-22af-499a-913e-54235f72bc0d,"Down, up, then back down again. It wouldn't be surprising if investors have gotten dizzy from the stock market's gyrations.

All of the volatility makes it difficult for many to know what to do. Should they buy stocks? Should they hold off?

In times like these, it would be nice to receive advice from one of the world's greatest investors ever -- Warren Buffett. Of course, the multibillionaire isn't a personal financial advisor. However, we don't have to look hard to find out what he'd probably say. Here's what Buffett would most likely recommend investors do right now.

What to do

We really don't know for sure how Buffett himself is investing right now. Our best picture is what Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B), the conglomerate he runs, did in the second quarter of 2022. In Q2, Berkshire bought nine stocks and sold six stocks.

But Buffett probably wouldn't tell you to mimic what he's doing anyway. As far as I know, he's never encouraged other investors to copy his moves. However, he has given very specific advice in the past.

In Buffett's 2013 letter to Berkshire Hathaway's shareholders, he wrote about how he and his longtime business partner Charlie Munger evaluate stocks. After this discussion, though, he noted that most investors don't need to do what he and Munger do.

Buffett rightly pointed out, ""In aggregate, American business has done wonderfully over time and will continue to do so (though, most assuredly, in unpredictable fits and starts)."" He stated that non-professionals should simply invest in a cross-section of businesses and that ""a lost-cost S&P 500 index fund will achieve this goal."" An index fund, as the name implies, simply holds all of the assets in the index that it attempts to track.

How serious was Buffett about this recommendation? He even put similar instructions in his will for how his cash should be invested for the benefit of his family. Buffett revealed that his will stipulates that 90% of the money should be invested in a low-cost S&P 500 index fund with 10% in short-term government bonds. He suggested Vanguard, which operates the Vanguard 500 Index Fund ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO).

What about timing?

But would Buffett think that buying an S&P 500 index fund such as Vanguard's would be the best thing to do right now? After all, as we discussed earlier, the market is really volatile. I think the answer to this question is a resounding ""yes.""

First of all, Buffett hasn't been shy about buying stocks for Berkshire's portfolio during times of high market volatility -- including this year. Granted, he has been selective about which stocks to buy. However, investing in an S&P 500 index fund doesn't require the kind of analysis that Buffett and his team conducts before buying stocks.

We also can look back to what Buffett said about the timing of investments. He wrote in 2013, ""The 'when' [of investing] is also important. The main danger is that the timid or beginning investors will enter the market at a time of extreme exuberance and then become disillusioned when paper losses occur.""

There's certainly no reason to worry about ""extreme exuberance"" right now. Even if that was the case, though, Buffett has an answer. In the 2013 letter to Berkshire shareholders, he stated, ""The antidote to that kind of mistiming is for an investor to accumulate shares over a long period and never to sell when the news is bad and stocks are well off their highs.""

In other words, Buffett's recommendation would probably be to buy an S&P 500 index fund now and keep buying on a regular basis. The most important caveat is that you shouldn't sell in an attempt to avoid a loss.

Good advice

Buffett told Berkshire's shareholders in 2013 to ""ignore the chatter"" and ""keep your costs minimal."" Investors who did so, he maintained, would be ""virtually certain to get satisfactory results.""

He was right. Historically, Buffett's recommended approach would have made investors a lot of money. The S&P 500 has experienced downturns in the past, but it's risen significantly over the long term. If you're looking for good advice on what to do in today's volatile market, you probably won't go wrong by listening to the Oracle of Omaha.

6a39a4b4-c562-45f1-90b3-cf0dbecd46cd,"The Producer Price Index for the month of August was just released. The data highlights a -0.1% MoM change in producer prices. It is also what most economists estimated the PPI to be. Meanwhile, the core PPI shows an MoM change of 0.4%, rather than the expected 0.3%.

Since the release of the data, the crypto prices have gone up. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum prices have surged by 1% in the last 24 hours. However, this rally does not have the same strength as the bulls were hoping for.

Why Inflation Data Is Important For Crypto

The CPI data released yesterday was not good news for the crypto market. The YoY inflation reveals that the market may have overestimated the reduction in inflation levels. The Federal Reserve was already prepared for a jumbo hike. However, after the bad inflation data, the market began to price in a 48% chance of a 100 bps crypto hike.

The Producer Price Index is the change in price the producers receive for goods and services. It is another indicator of inflation. The Fed takes into account the PPI data before making its decision on the next inflation data. However, this PPI data may not be enough to change the Fed’s stance. According to @tedtalksmacro, a major crypto influencer, the increase of inflation in PPI might even be the bigger deal,

Key Fed officials backed taking an aggressive stance to combat the inflation levels. Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester has backed bringing the interest rate over 400 target level. Neel Kashkari of Minnesota Fed, a traditional dove, backed a Volcker-esque stance. Paul Volcker, a Fed president, raised interest rates to curb inflation, even at the cost of tipping the economy to a recession.

Will Elon Musk’s Deflation Warning Come True

With the PPI data failing to provide good news on inflation, the Fed is all set for a big interest hike on the 21st of September at the next FOMC meet. According to Elon Musk, such a hike will lead the US economy to deflation.

5a132c40-6e70-4960-9239-cc91b9294d4b,"Following the higher-than-expected CPI inflation data on Tuesday, Bitcoin and the broader crypto market witnessed a sharp fall. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at 8.4% over the last 24 hours holding just above its crucial support of $20,000.

Bitcoin’s price crash came alongside that of the S&P 500 dropping 4.5% and slipping under $4,000. As on-chain data provider Santiment explains:

After a brutal #CPI report on disappointing inflation news Tuesday, #Bitcoin fell alongside the #SP500‘s biggest daily drop in two years. The correlation between the sectors remains high, and #crypto typically thrives best with zero #equity reliance.

As we know, Bitcoin has been showing a greater correlation with the S&P 500 here. As long as Bitcoin continues to follow the equity markets it is likely to stay in the bear’s grip going ahead.

Bitcoin (BTC) Can Correct Another 20%

If BTC continues to follow its correlation with S&P 500, another 20% drop to $16,000 is very much likely. Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at Fidelity said:

If a 14x forward multiple is the correct valuation, then simple math will tell us that the fair value for the S&P 500 is 3200-3400 at an EPS of $230. This suggests that this bear market is not yet over.

Just as the news of U.S. CPI inflation came on Tuesday, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index slid from 34/100 to 27/100. However, it has still not entered the “extreme fear” zone which shows some kind of investor resilience at this point.

Once again the news of inflation prevents Bitcoin from crossing its 200-day moving average (DMA), a zone of crucial resistance for Bitcoin this year.

Along with Bitcoin, several other altcoins have also corrected. A day ahead of the Merge event, Ethereum (ETH) has once again tanked 7% moving to $1,600 levels. As the Merge approaches closer, ETH has come under some selling pressure by following “sell the news” kind of momentum."

LONDON, Sept 12 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) is finding that creativity can thrive in a crisis. Board members Michael Klein and Blythe Masters recently floated the idea of giving senior dealmakers an equity stake in the investment banking division, Bloomberg reported. The Swiss lender needs to keep its best advisers but can’t afford to pay large quantities of cash. Though it currently gives them Credit Suisse stock, shares in the investment banking unit would be more closely linked to their performance. The lender has form in finding creative ways to reward employees. After the 2008 crash, it paid bosses’ bonuses in instruments linked to risky assets acquired during the preceding boom.

For Credit Suisse investors, the lesson is that Chairman Axel Lehmann seems to be considering radical changes, in contrast to the bland strategy launched late last year. The question is how much short-term pain he is willing to take. Some of the bank’s best businesses, like arranging leveraged loans, have minimal overlap with Credit Suisse’s core wealth unit. Handing ownership stakes to employees would arguably be a step towards spinning off the investment bank. With Credit Suisse shares trading at one-third of tangible book value, it may be time to slay some sacred cows. (By Liam Proud)

The weakest American borrowers are starting to miss payments and default on their loans, and that is showing up at a surprising place: Goldman Sachs . While competitors like Bank of America enjoy repayment rates at or near record levels, Goldman's loss rate on credit card loans hit 2.93% in the second quarter. That's the worst among big U.S. card issuers and ""well above subprime lenders,"" according to a Sept. 6 note from JPMorgan. The profile of Goldman's card customers actually resembles that of issuers known for their subprime offerings. More than a quarter of Goldman's card loans have gone to customers with FICO scores below 660, according to filings. That could expose the bank to higher losses if the economy experiences a downturn, as is expected by many forecasters. ""People are losing their jobs and you had inflation at 40-year highs; that will impact the subprime cohort more because they are living paycheck to paycheck,"" Michael Taiano, a senior director at Fitch Ratings, said in an interview. ""With Goldman the question will be, were they growing too fast into a late-cycle period?"" The dynamic comes at a sensitive time for CEO David Solomon. Under pressure to improve the bank's stock price, Goldman's money-losing consumer operations have drawn headlines and the ire of some investors and insiders. The investment bank began its foray into consumer finance in 2016 to diversify from its traditional strengths of Wall Street trading and advisory activities. But the journey has been a bumpy one, marked by leadership turnover and staff departures, missed product deadlines, confusion over branding, a regulatory probe and mounting losses.

Solomon will likely face questions from directors about the consumer business at a board meeting later this week, according to people with knowledge of the matter. There is internal dissent about who Solomon has picked to lead key businesses, and insiders hope he puts stronger managers in place, the people said. Some feel as though Solomon, who moonlights as a DJ on the international festival circuit, has been too extroverted, putting his own personal brand ahead of the bank's, the people said. Goldman declined to comment for this article, and Apple didn't immediately return a request for comment.

A viral hit

Goldman's credit card business, anchored by the Apple Card since 2019, has arguably been the company's biggest success yet in terms of gaining retail lending scale. It's the largest contributor to the division's 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances, a figure that Goldman said would nearly double to $30 billion by 2024. But rising losses threaten to mar that picture. Lenders deem bad loans ""charge-offs"" after a customer misses payments for six months; Goldman's 2.93% net charge-off rate is double the 1.47% rate at JPMorgan 's card business and higher than Bank of America's 1.60%, despite being a fraction of those issuers' size. Goldman's losses are also higher than that of Capital One , the largest subprime player among big banks, which had a 2.26% charge-off rate. ""If there's one thing Goldman is supposed to be good at, its risk management,"" said Jason Mikula, a former Goldman employee who now consults for the industry. ""So how do they have charge-off rates comparable to a subprime portfolio?""

Apple Card

The biggest reason is because Goldman's customers have been with the bank for less than two years on average, according to people with knowledge of the business who weren't authorized to speak to the press. Charge-off rates tend to be highest during the first few years a user has a card; as Goldman's pool of customers ages and struggling users drop out, those losses should calm down, the people said. The bank leans on third-party data providers to compare metrics with similar cards of the same vintage and is comfortable with its performance, the people said. Other banks also tend to be more aggressive in seeking to recover debt, which improves competitors' net charge-off figures, the people said. But another factor is that Goldman's biggest credit product, the Apple Card, is aimed at a broad swath of the country, including those with lower credit scores. Early in its rollout, some users were stunned to learn they had been approved for the card despite checkered credit histories. ""Goldman has to play in a broader credit spectrum than other banks, that's part of the issue,"" said a person who once worked at the New York-based bank, who asked for anonymity to speak candidly about his former employer. ""They have no direct-to-consumer offering yet, and when you have the Apple Card and the GM card, you are looking at Americana.""

Spitting distance

After the 2008 financial crisis caused by undisciplined lending, most banks shifted to serving the well-off, and competitors including JPMorgan and Bank of America tend to focus on higher-end borrowers. The exception among big banks was Capital One, which focuses more on subprime offerings after buying HSBC's U.S. card business in 2011. Capital One says 30% of its loans were to customers with FICO scores below 660, a band that contains near-prime and subprime users. That's within spitting distance of Goldman's proportion of sub-660 customers, which was 28% as of June. Meanwhile, JPMorgan said 12% of its loans were to users with below-660 scores, and Bank of America said that 3.7% of loans were tied to FICO scores under 620. After a period in which borrowers fortified by Covid pandemic stimulus checks repaid their debts like never before, it is the industry's ""newer entrants"" that are ""showing much faster weakening"" in credit metrics, JPMorgan analyst Vivek Juneja wrote last week. ""Goldman's credit card net change-off ratio has risen sharply in the past 3 quarters,"" he wrote. That is happening ""despite unemployment remaining very low at 3.7% in August, similar to 2019 levels.""

Mounting losses"
bee5bc88-81ac-4029-9156-410af831b89e,"TORONTO, Sept. 12, 2022 /CNW/ - Dye & Durham Limited (TSX: DND) (""Dye & Durham"" or the ""Company""), a leading provider of cloud-based, efficient workflow software for legal and business professionals, today provided an update regarding its proposed acquisition of Link Administration Holdings Limited (ASX: LNK) (""Link Group"") and the related UK Financial Conduct Authority's (""FCA"") regulatory approval process.

The FCA has delivered a Warning Notice to Dye & Durham stating that it is proposing to approve the Company's acquisition of Link Fund Solutions Limited (""LFS"") subject to conditions, which are subject to finalization.

The currently proposed conditions provide that the FCA will not approve the proposed acquisition unless Dye & Durham undertakes to cover any shortfall in the value of the assets of Link Fund Solutions Limited (""LFS""), up to a maximum of £306 million (approximately A$523 million or C$465 million) in relation to any restitution and/or redress payments that the FCA may levy on LFS in relation to its management of the LF Woodford Equity and Income Fund (""Woodford Fund""). For certainty, the process by which any restitution and/or redress liability is decided is still underway and no determinations in that respect have been made.

The Woodford Fund was a £3 billion (approximately A$5.13 billion or C$4.56 billion) investment fund that collapsed in 2019 after it was unable to repay investors. The FCA commenced an enforcement investigation into LFS, which was responsible for managing the Woodford Fund, including its liquidity, in June 2019. In its latest audited financials, released on August 30, 2022, Link Group disclosed that no provision for contingent liability has been made by it in respect of the Woodford Fund matters.

Dye & Durham is currently assessing the impact of the proposed condition on the proposed acquisition of Link Group. If Dye & Durham is unable to accept the FCA's conditions, one of the conditions precedent in the proposed Link Group acquisition's scheme implementation deed (the ""scheme"") would not be capable of being satisfied.

Story continues

Dye & Durham is not a party to the FCA's enforcement investigation of LFS. The Company is supportive of any resolution which would result in the Woodford fund holders being appropriately compensated, to the extent that the FCA's investigation ultimately concludes that there were failings by LFS which contributed to investor losses.

Dye & Durham is in active discussions with Link Group to find a resolution with respect to the matters set out in this press release that will allow the proposed transaction to proceed. The Company will provide an update on the proposed acquisition and its timing when it is legally required or otherwise appropriate to do so.

As part of the FCA's regulatory approval process, Dye & Durham received change-of-control approval from the FCA with respect to six of the seven UK-regulated entities owned by Link Group.

Sept 8 (Reuters) - The Australian competition regulator said on Thursday it will not oppose an A$2.47 billion ($1.67 billion) acquisition of Link Administration Holdings by Canada's Dye & Durham Ltd, if it divests its existing local business.

The Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) said the acquisition would be unlikely to ""substantially lessen competition"", assuming the Canadian cloud-based software firm divests its existing local businesses, as stated in Dye & Durham's court-enforceable pledge.

Link shares jumped 8.1% to A$4.66 as of 0015 GMT, their highest since May 11.

The deal will give Dye & Durham (D&D) access to share registry firm Link's prized 42.8% stake in online property settlement firm PEXA Group Ltd, which was the subject of concern for the regulator.

""The ACCC has focussed on ensuring that the post-acquisition market structure does not hinder competition over the longer term,"" ACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said. (https://bit.ly/3x1Sc7q)

""Ultimately, the ACCC concluded that the proposed acquisition, taking into consideration the divestiture undertaking, would be unlikely to substantially lessen competition.""

The approval comes on the heels of PEXA Group announcing acquisition of a UK-based remortgage processing firm Optima Legal on expectations that rising interest rates prompt people to switch their lenders in search of better rates.

For the second time this year, a British regulator has complicated Toronto legal software consolidator Dye & Durham Ltd.’s DND-T global expansion plans, throwing its largest-ever deal into doubt.

The company is in the latter stages of closing its purchase of Sydney-based Link Administration Holdings Ltd. for 2.34 billion Australian dollars (about $2.09-billion), after receiving clearance last week from Australia’s competition and consumer commission, which required D&D to sell its existing Australian businesses acquired in 2021 for a combined $248-million. Link shareholders approved the takeover last month.

But on Monday, D&D said it had received a warning notice from Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority that the regulator wouldn’t approve the acquisition of Link’s fund solutions business included in the deal unless the buyer undertakes to cover a shortfall of up to £306-million ($465-million) related to its role in the meltdown of the LF Woodford Equity Fund in 2019.

Australian competition regulator says it won’t oppose $1.67-billion Link buyout by Dye & Durham

Link administered the £3-billion fund, which collapsed in 2019 after its British namesake, star stock picker Neil Woodford, was forced out and it was unable to repay investors after enduring heavy redemptions. Lawyers representing thousands of investors have launched legal actions against Link; the company has said it did nothing illegal and will vigorously defend itself.

D&D said the nine-figure obligation would be related “to any restitution and/or redress payments that the FCA may levy” on the Link unit to cover any shortfall in the value of its assets.

The FCA’s notice could threaten D&D’s Link acquisition, announced in late 2021, which has proceeded against a backdrop of deteriorating market conditions for tech companies. D&D has already negotiated a 12.5-per-cent price cut on the deal with Link, dropping the original deal struck at 5.50 Australian dollars per share last December to 4.81 Australian dollars in July.

“This adds some incremental uncertainty regarding the timing of the Link transaction, and/or the probability that the deal proceeds,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Thanos Moschopoulos said in an interview, calling the development “unexpected.”

D&D said in a statement that while it supports any outcome that results in Woodford fund holders receiving proper compensation, it is “currently assessing the impact of the proposed condition” from the regulator. If the company is unable to accept the FCA’s final order, a condition in the takeover deal “would not be capable of being satisfied.” D&D said it is now in “active discussions with Link Group to find a resolution.”

Link’s Australian-listed shares fell by 20 per cent Tuesday to close at 3.58 Australian dollars, after being halted Monday.

In its most recent audited financial statements, Link disclosed it had made no provision for contingent liability. D&D said the process to determine restitution or liability “is still underway and no determinations in that respect have been made” as the FCA’s proposed conditions are preliminary. The Canadian company declined further comment.

D&D has not disclosed how much the added liability could add to its purchase costs after factoring out any liability insurance recoveries Link could make, or the potential values of assets within the unit it could sell.

The notice comes just over a month after the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority ordered D&D to sell a British property-search software company it bought in 2021 for $156-million after finding earlier this year that the takeover would reduce competition and lead to higher prices for software users.

D&D has also faced a backlash in Canada for its strategy of buying up providers of real estate software and then sharply increasing prices, sometimes by hundreds of percentage points. The strategy has prompted dozens of complaints to Canada’s Competition Bureau and a class-action lawsuit, and law firms have had little choice but to pass the costs on to property buyers.

The company was an early star of the COVID-19 pandemic as its stock price shot up after it went public in the summer of 2020. But its shares have lost two-thirds of their value this year, weighed down by a crash in values for tech companies, concerns over property transaction volumes as rising interest rates cool the Canadian housing market, and uncertainty related to its Link acquisition and potential divestitures.

D&D shares closed at $14.43 on the Toronto Stock Exchange Monday, down 1.8 per cent.

Mr. Moschopoulos said, “All else equal, I’d prefer to see the Link deal happen because it would provide some additional diversification to D&D’s business.” He added that, deal or no deal, there wouldn’t be much impact on the stock’s valuation."

SYDNEY--Link Administration Holdings Ltd. has rebuffed a revised takeover proposal from Dye & Durham Ltd., which sought to restructure the deal after discovering that it could be liable for an asset shortfall in the U.K.

Link on Monday said that Dye & Durham had proposed an upfront payment of 3.81 Australian dollars (US$2.56) per share, plus a further payment linked to the extent of its liability."

Dye & Durham Ltd. may have to cover a shortfall of up to 306 million pounds ($354.6 million) in the value of assets of a company belonging to acquisition target Link Administration Holdings Ltd. to get regulatory approval in the U.K.

The Financial Conduct Authority said it won't approve the acquisition of Link Group if Dye & Durham doesn't undertake to cover any shortfall in the value of assets of Link Fund Solutions Ltd., the company said on Monday.

The FCA said it may levy on LFS up to GBP306 million for restitution or redress payments relating to a fund it managed called LF Woodford Equity and Income Fund.

The Woodford fund was a GBP3 billion investment fund that collapsed in 2019 after it failed to repay its investors, which the FCA later investigated.

However, Dye & Durham said that Link Group disclosed that no provision for contingent liability has been made regarding the Woodford Fund matters in its audited financial release in August of this year.

The company said it is currently assessing the effects of what the conditions could mean for the proposed acquisition of Link Group, but noted that if it isn't able to accept the FCA's condition, it won't be able to go through with the proposed transaction.

By Huw Jones

LONDON, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Link Fund Solutions, which managed the collapsed LF Woodford Equity Income Fund, could be forced to pay up to 306 million pounds ($358 million) in redress, Britain's Financial Conduct Authority said on Monday.

The FCA was responding to news that Dye and Durham is proposing to take over LFS and six other companies in the Australian share registry firm Link Group, all authorised by the UK financial watchdog.

Dye & Durham and Link last week received approval from the Australian competition regulator for the buyout, putting an end to a nine-month long acquisition saga that saw multiple offers and rival bidders vying for Link's stake in online property settlement firm PEXA Group.

The planned takeover forced the FCA to update the market on its lengthy probe into the collapse of WEIF in June 2019 which left more than 300,000 investors nursing losses.

LFS was the authorised corporate director for the 3.7 billion WEIF, which was finally closed in October 2019, and whose assets had been picked by veteran star manager Neil Woodford.

""The FCA has investigated the circumstances leading to the suspension of the WEIF and is likely to seek to require LFS to pay a financial penalty and/or consumer redress,"" the FCA said.

Woodford was criticised by lawmakers and investors for holding a large number of illiquid assets, making it hard to meet redemption calls after months of underperformance.

""This redress proposal reflects the FCA's current view of LFS's failings in managing the liquidity of the WEIF,"" the regulator added.

Link Group in a statement to the Australian stock exchange said LFS ""does not agree with the FCA's view"", and that it will explore all options, including challenging any warning notice that may be issued by the regulatory decisions committee.

Story continues

""Link Group has not made any commitment to fund or financially support LFS,"" the Sydney-based firm said. ""Link Group considers that any liabilities relating to the Woodford matters will be confined to LFS.""

Dye & Durham late on Monday said it was assessing the impact of the proposed condition on the proposed buyout of Link Group, and that it was in active discussion with Link to resolve the issue. (https://bit.ly/3eJ0LO5)

The Canadian software firm has received change-of-control approval from the FCA for six of the seven UK-regulated entities owned by Link Group, it added.

The FCA has approved D&D's acquisition of LFS, subject to a condition to commit to making up any shortfall within LFS in the amount available to cover any redress payments.

No other conditions have been imposed on LFS or the six other firms being taken over by D&D, the FCA said.

The watchdog said it could not give any further information because its investigation into the circumstances surrounding WEIF's suspension continued, but it will provide an update as soon as it can.

The FCA told lawmakers in January it was close to a decision on whether to take enforcement action regarding the suspension of WEIF in June 2019.

With many experts continuing to see rocky times ahead for the stock market, it might be time to look at dividend stocks for the rest of 2022.

Dividend stocks are a way to diversify a portfolio that may be chasing growth a little too obsessively. They generate income in good times, bad times and, particularly important today, times of high inflation. (U.S. consumer prices rose 8.5% in July from a year ago.)

They also tend to outdo the S&P 500 over the long run.

One prominent portfolio that’s heavy on dividend stocks belongs to The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust. With the trust being used to pay for so many initiatives, income needs to keep flowing into it.

Dividend stocks help make this happen.

Here are three dividend stocks that occupy significant space in the foundation’s holdings.

There’s a ‘perfect storm’ brewing in the multifamily housing market — here are 3 of the easiest ways to take advantage

Waste Management (WM)

It’s not the most glamorous of industries, but waste management is an essential one.

No matter what happens with the economy, municipalities have little choice but to pay companies to get rid of our mountains of garbage, even if those costs increase.

As one of the biggest players in the space, Waste Management remains in an entrenched position.

The shares have more than doubled over the past five years. And management is projecting 10% revenue growth for the year.

Currently offering a yield of 1.5%, Waste Management’s dividend has increased 19 years in a row.

The company has paid out almost $1 billion in dividends over the last year, and its roughly $2.5 billion in free cash flow for 2021 means investors shouldn’t have to worry about receiving their checks.

Caterpillar (CAT)

As a company whose fortunes typically follow that of the larger economy — that’ll happen when your equipment is a fixture on building sites the world over — Caterpillar is in an intriguing post-pandemic position.

The company’s revenues are feeling the effects of a paralyzed global supply chain, but still-historically low interest rates and President Joe Biden’s recently passed $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill mean there could be an awful lot of building going on in the U.S. in the near future.

Caterpillar’s mining and energy businesses also provide exposure to commodities, which tend to do well during times of high inflation.

The company’s stock has ridden higher raw material and petroleum prices to a greater than 55% increase over the past five years.

After announcing an 8% increase in June, Caterpillar’s quarterly dividend is currently at $1.20 per share and offers a yield of 2.5%. The company has increased its annual dividend 28 years straight.

Walmart (WMT)

With grocery stores deemed essential businesses, Walmart was able to keep its more than 4,700 stores in the U.S. open throughout the pandemic.

Not only has the company increased both profits and market share since COVID coughed its way across the planet, but its reputation as a low-cost haven makes Walmart many consumers’ go-to retailer when prices are rising.

Walmart has steadily increased its dividends over the past 49 years. Its annual payout is currently $2.24 per share, translating into a dividend yield of 1.6%.

Walmart currently trades at $136 per share, well off its 52-week highs of $160.77 set in April.

afba259c-e609-4f8a-847e-5d8db8d5120b,"













TOKYO, Sept 12 (Reuters) - The yen may be near 24-year lows, but Japan's central bank is not even close to trying to support it with higher interest rates.

That is the message from three sources familiar with the thinking of the Bank of Japan (BOJ), and it was strongly implied by the country's top foreign exchange diplomat last week and indeed by central bank chief Haruhiko Kuroda in July.

The government - especially the Ministry of Finance (MOF) - has repeatedly and strongly expressed dissatisfaction with this year's falls in the yen, which on Sept. 7 dropped as far as 144.990 per dollar, down 30% since the end of 2021.

But the central bank is independent and by law obliged to attend to inflation and the state of the economy, not the exchange rate.

Its support for the weak economy with ultra-low interest rates is the main factor behind the yen's weakness, since other central banks, notably the U.S. Federal Reserve, are briskly tightening monetary policy, making their currencies more attractive as destinations for capital.

The BOJ has no intention of raising interest rates or tweaking its dovish policy guidance to prop up the yen, the sources said.

""The BOJ won't directly target currency rates in guiding policy,"" said one of them. ""It looks at yen moves in the context of how they affect the economy and prices.""

""Current economic conditions don't justify tweaking ultra-loose policy,"" that person said, expressing a view echoed by the other two sources.

Official statements are in fact consistent with that.

The BOJ has joined the finance ministry in warning against sharp falls in the currency. But Kuroda said in July, ""It's hard to believe that just by raising rates somewhat, you can stop the yen's decline.""

That view is still widely shared in the central bank, the sources said.

When the MOF expresses its displeasure with the yen's falls, it is said to be jawboning - dropping a hint that it may intervene in the market to support the currency. This is intended to make traders cautious in selling the yen.

Last week's comments by Masato Kanda, a MOF official who serves as Japan's top currency diplomat, emphasized the divergence between the government and central bank.

Both were ""extremely worried"" about recent rapid yen moves, Kanda said.

But he declined to comment on BOJ policy and said ""the government"" - instead of ""government and the BOJ"" - was ready to use all available tools to battle excessive yen declines.

""Each of us has our own mandate. That's why I carefully used 'government' as the subject at times and 'government and BOJ' at other times,"" Kanda told reporters.

He was speaking after a meeting between the ministry and central bank.

DOVISH POLICY GUIDANCE

Japan's economic weakness gives the BOJ little reason to withdraw the monetary stimulus that is undermining the yen. The central bank is set to maintain ultra-low interest rates and dovish policy guidance at its Sept. 21 and 22 meeting. read more

As for the currency, the most it can do is to maintain, or perhaps strengthen, a warning it inserted in its policy statement in June. It said then that it would ""closely watch financial and currency market developments, as well as the impact on Japan's economy and prices.""

That leaves possible MOF market intervention as the main concern for investors betting against the yen. Yet even that looks improbable, considering that Tokyo would have difficulty getting the necessary consent from other members of the G7 group of large economies. read more

""The BOJ's dovish policy stance will come under the spotlight as European and U.S. central banks hike rates,"" said Masahiro Ichikawa, chief market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management. ""The weak-yen trend will continue.""

But the BOJ's focus on inflation and the economy does not mean it would never act in response to currency moves, the sources said.

It could feel compelled to respond in the event of a freefall that became so extreme that the economy and price stability were threatened, they said.

That, however, is not the current situation.

4fab58cc-1c37-4009-9020-27dfb93fd6fe,"(Reuters) -Chicago Federal Reserve President Charles Evans on Thursday joined his fellow U.S. central bank policymakers in saying that getting high inflation down is ""job one,"" and to do so the Fed ""could very well"" raise interest rates by another 75 basis points this month.

There is a ""decent chance"" the result won't be a recession, Evans said at an economic forum held at the College of Dupage in Glen Ellyn, Illinois.

""We don't want to unnecessarily restrict the economy,"" he said. ""But we do need to be concerned about the high inflation environment,"" where inflation, currently at 6.3% by the Fed's preferred measure, has been running above the central bank's 2% goal since last spring.

Saying that he had not yet made up his mind on the right move at the Sept. 20-21 policy meeting, Evans made clear the point is that the Fed's policy rate - now in the 2.25%-2.50% range - must rise to what he feels should be a 3.25%-3.50% range this year and to about 4.00% next year.

The U.S. unemployment rate, now at 3.7%, will also climb, but only as high as about 4.5%, much less than could be expected if the inflation battle were down to the Fed's rate hikes alone, Evans said.

He added that he expects inflation to fall to below 3% next year, due not just to the Fed's rate hikes but also as pandemic-tangled supply chains, a key driver of inflation globally, become unstuck.

As for U.S. growth, he said, ""I think we'll muddle through"" with GDP growing about a half a percent this year and not contracting.

JARED BLIKRE: Welcome back to ""Yahoo Finance Live."" Good morning. It is Wednesday, September 7, as we begin the second half of our show here on Yahoo Finance. I'm Jared Blikre alongside Julie Hyman. And let us check the markets.

Here we have a little bit of a rally underway. The Dow is up just under 100 points or about one third of a percent. The S&P 500 up about just short of 4/10 of a percent. The NASDAQ leading the way higher, up just over half a percent. And for the latest market action, we want to turn to Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferré over at the Ya-- over at the YFi Interactive. Ines, what do you have your eye on this morning?

INES FERRÉ: Yeah, Jared, just taking a look at the markets right now, we are checking out the US dollar index. I know that you guys have spoken quite a bit about this. But the dollar, being seen as a safe haven. So that's putting pressure on some assets, risk assets. It's putting pressure on crypto as well. And also, putting pressure on commodities. I'll get to that in just a second.

But let's take a look at the overall markets right now when we're looking at the sectors. You've got utilities and consumer discretionary, which are in the green. Over on the NASDAQ 100, you can see on our YFi Interactive board, Tesla up more than 1 and 1/2%. And then taking a look at crypto, we have been watching Bitcoin falling below the $19,000 per token level, down 4 and 1/2% over the last 24 hours.

Checking out oil because we have been seeing a sharp decline with commodities, with WTI down more than 3%. You've got WTI below $85 per barrel, punching below that level and heading towards $83 per barrel. And you've got Brent Crude down almost 4% earlier today, sitting just below $90 per barrel.

So you've got that strong US dollar that's putting pressure on oil. You've got recession fear, some economic data coming out of China. Also with demand concerns going forward for crude, guys.

JULIE HYMAN: Ines, thank you very much."

Video Transcript

JARED BLIKRE: Welcome back. We are taking a look at the major averages ahead of the open. You can see the Dow off a quarter of a percent there, not even triple digits that we're looking at. S&P 500 down a little bit less than the NASDAQ, down a whopping six basis points. And we're also weighing a skyrocketing dollar and the increasing likelihood of a 75 basis point rate hike this month by the Fed.

So what does this road ahead look like for investors, who are, admittedly, a little bit nervous? Joining us now to discuss this, Tematica Research's chief investment officer, Chris Versace. And Chris, got to start with the big elephant in the room here, which is the US dollar. I'm looking at a chart of the US dollar versus the yen on the YFi Interactive. This is today, 1 and 1/2 percentage points over the last day, two days, 3%. This is a huge move by the yen. I'm wondering what all these currency moves are saying to you right now.

CHRIS VERSACE: Well, I mean, look, we've seen a sharp rebound in the dollar over the last several weeks, but even before that, we had companies warning about the impact to their revenue some six, eight weeks ago, whether they were Salesforce, Microsoft, and even more recently, Salesforce did it again. Dell said it again. And then last night, we had Unipath really chop their earnings expectations, really, the top line for the current quarter, citing currency and macroeconomic uncertainty.

So when we think about the sharp increase in the dollar, we've got to sit back and say, OK, companies with meaningful exposure outside the US, what does this mean for their ability to compete? What does this mean for currency translation? And unfortunately, it's not really good news for them. And, you know, candidly, this is one of just simply another reason to think that earnings expectations, as we go through the month of September, are likely to come down.

Story continues

JULIE HYMAN: As you say, it's one of many reasons. So do you isolate companies that have that big international exposure and focus more on domestic plays right now, or does that not even help you very much because of some of the other headwinds you referenced?

CHRIS VERSACE: Well, let's tick off those headwinds, right, for the viewers. So we do have, as Jared pointed out, dollar concerns. We've got the slowing economy. We have higher borrowing costs that are going to get only more so. Companies are cutting back on their spending. So you really got to figure out where can I go where demand is resilient. Demand is inelastic. Perhaps I also want to take a look at some dividend income plays.

So over at the Action Alerts PLUS portfolio, we've been very conscious of this unfolding pretty much the way it has. And we've really pivoted the portfolio into some more domestic names to your point, Julie, companies like an American waterworks, for example, or even a Verizon, where no matter what happens, we know that people are going to continue to consume water.

We know that in today's increasingly connected society, people are not going to shun their smartphones. So we know that wireless service is relatively defensive. And those companies also have great track records for increasing their dividends.

So there are plays out there. Just real quickly, some other areas that I would suggest to your viewers, think of all the stimulus that Washington is bringing on. Whether it's the CHIPS Act, whether it's fighting inflation or the Biden infrastructure law, these are all areas that are largely domestic. They're also areas that are going to see uptick in spending. And I would suggest that readers position themselves for that.

JARED BLIKRE: Well, Chris, let me follow up on that. You mentioned some dividend names before, but I know from your notes, you also like cybersecurity. Wondering if that fits in what you've been-- with what you've been talking about the CHIPS Act and these new investments and such.

CHRIS VERSACE: Not so much. I think if we think about enterprise spending, however, again, we've heard commentary that it's starting to slow, but we also know that the pace of cyberattacks just continues to accelerate, ransomware in particular. A company needs-- companies, excuse me, need to continue to protect their crown jewels, even as the type of attacks that we're seeing are widening out.

You know, I believe most recently, IHG got hacked, large hotel company, which also raises some data privacy concerns, but you look at some of the attacks going on in Europe with energy companies and the like. It's just a complete widening out. And longer term, whether it's 5G and IoT, more connected devices mean more points of vulnerability that need to be protected. So this is a huge pain point for companies. And they're going to have to spend to address it.

And Jared, I think I just saw a statistic that said 43% of surveyed CEOs don't think their companies can successfully fend off a cyber attack. So that tells you, this is an area of spending. And there's a lot of different companies that people can buy. The preferred way that we have is to get well rounded exposure using a cybersecurity ETF, whether it's CIBR or perhaps even HACK.

JULIE HYMAN: All of this says to me that you are on the defensive, Chris. How worried should investors be right now? How much do they need to be thinking in that defensive posture?

CHRIS VERSACE: So the way we approach it, Julie, is we always try to look forward, right? And when we're doing that right now, just think of the conversation that we had already. Dollar headwinds, you know, economy slowing, higher borrowing costs, all these things. And you have to ask yourself, OK, which way are earnings expectations likely to go? Is there a reason to think that they're going to move demonstrably higher? Or do they need to be revised lower?

And I think just the comments that companies have put out in the last couple of days tells us that the risk is greater to the downside. Remember, too, that we have a rash of earnings conferences this week and next week. So we, along with everybody else on Wall Street, will be listening for, at the margin, what is new. What's the update since companies reported? And odds are a lot of these factors are going to weigh on their guidance-- again, another reason to think that those earnings expectations for the second half of the year are likely to come down.

And here's the thing-- they've already been coming down. If you look at where S&P 500 consensus expectations were for the second half of the year, at the end of the second quarter, compared to the first half, they were up just shy of 10%. Now they're up just over 3%. Odds are they're going to come down even further.

JULIE HYMAN: Well, not too cheery of a conversation, but maybe a realistic one. Chris, thank you so much. Appreciate it. Chris Versace of Tematica Research, the chief investment officer there. Good to catch up with you, Chris."

- Let's try to break things down on the broader market action. We've got Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre standing by. Ines, we've been watching currencies a lot. We were talking about the huge surge that we saw in the dollar index yesterday. What are we seeing today?

INES FERRE: Yeah, that's right. We did see that huge surge in that dollar index. I'm pulling it up right here on our YFi Interactive board. And you can see a little bit of easing here.

But nevertheless, keep in mind, these are multidecade highs. This is the US Dollar Index against a basket of other currencies. The euro heavily weighted here as well.

And then just taking a look at the US dollar against the Japanese yen, hitting a new 24-year high. And you also have the British pound against the US dollar hitting its lowest level since 1985. So we've got a lot of strength in the dollar that we've been seeing recently.

This also puts pressure on commodities. So the strong dollar puts pressure on oil because oil is quoted in dollars. So you've got WTI that is down almost 4%, WTI punching below $85 a barrel. We haven't seen those levels since January of this year, an important psychological level for WTI. And it's heading towards $83 a barrel. And then Brent crude sitting below $90 a barrel.

A lot of headlines that we've seen with oil recently with energy. You have the G7 nations that are vowing to put a price cap on Russian oil. You've got Russia saying that they will not supply any oil to any countries that put price caps on their oil. You've got that strong US dollar. And, of course, recession fears is also driving oil lower, guys.

- Yeah, incredible to see the yen trading at 144 to the dollar. All right, thanks so much for that, Ines."

JARED BLIKRE: Welcome back. And we're going to take a look at some of the market movers this morning. And I'm looking at the US Dollar Index. It is up another 38 basis points. Doesn't sound like much, but this is a 20-year high. By the way, that's a three-month chart right there. And as it relates to commodities, well, it's pushing down crude oil. And crude oil is down 4% to 85-- $83 and change right now. And that is the lowest price that we have seen since January.

And we can see now you'd have to draw a line all the way back here. And this just looks like a huge distribution top. Reading some headlines, should have been bullish for oil about Russia not wanting to sell into sanction markets. Nevertheless, we have seen pressure come to the downside. And again, with the US dollar the denominator in a lot of these fractions here, that's just going to continue as we face that pressure from the US dollar, Julie.

JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, really interesting, the action that we're seeing in oil prices. And I saw, I think it was Oklahoma now is the first state in the union that's now has a gasoline price that is below $3 a barrel for the first time in quite a long time. I believe it is-- I don't know. It's been a long time."
0e3133f2-391c-4529-875e-caa6153012fb,"“We need to act now, forthrightly, strongly, as we have been doing,” Mr Powell said at the Cato Institute’s 40th Annual Monetary Conference.

The remarks cap an eventful week for central banks, with the Bank of Canada also delivering a 0.75 of a percentage point rise, which took its cash rate to 3.25 per cent – the highest among advanced economies.

Dr Lowe's hints that the pace of tightening will slow prompted rates traders to downgrade the projected path of interest rates. That is predicated on the argument that inflationary conditions are more benign in Australia than the extremes experienced elsewhere, with a nod specifically to wages.

The RBA delivered a widely anticipated 0.5 of a percentage point lift in the cash rate to 2.35 per cent this week.

“The contrast from Dr Lowe alluding to a slower pace of rate hikes, and what we heard from Powell and the ECB overnight, was quite stark – both sounded very different,” said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP.

“We’ve seen this week that the RBA is less hawkish than other central banks, which is partly enabled by the slower wages growth figures in Australia and lower levels of inflation generally.”

The ECB downgraded the eurozone’s growth outlook and revised up its inflation forecasts as the bloc braces for a winter recession amid widespread gas shortages.

The bank lifted its inflation projection for this year to 8.1 per cent, from 6.8 per cent, and for next year to 5.5 per cent, from 3.5 per cent. Its prediction for 2024 remained at 2.3 per cent.

The new forecasts imply that the pace of annual price increases will remain above the ECB’s 2 per cent target for at least three years. Inflation in the region hit a record 9.1 per cent in August.

Meanwhile, the ECB's growth forecast for this year is 3.1 per cent, from 2.8 per cent, but it cut its projection for next year to 0.9 per cent, from 2.1 per cent.

“In a classic case of central banks looking at the economy with a glass half-full, the next three quarters were marked much weaker, avoiding negative numbers,” said Rodrigo Catril, senior FX strategist at National Australia Bank.

“No energy means no growth, so I’m not sure how one can square this circle, especially now that we must add an aggressive policy tightening on top of it.”

Reassessment

The hawkish tone expressed by ECB and Fed officials triggered a sell-off across bond markets, while shares climbed.

The yield on Germany’s two-year note rocketed by more than 20 basis points to 1.32 per cent – its highest since 2011 – while the US equivalent jumped 5.5 basis points to almost 3.5 per cent.

On Wall Street, all three major benchmarks advanced about 0.6 per cent, translating to a 0.2 per cent rise at the open for the S & P/ASX 200.

Traders will turn their attention to the release of US inflation figures next week. Morgan Stanley forecasts headline inflation eased to 7.9 per cent in August, down 1.2 percentage points from June’s 40-year high of 9.1 per cent. However, core inflation is expected to rise to 6.1 per cent, from 5.9 per cent.

The broker thinks the US core CPI, minus food and energy, will peak this month."

LONDON, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Banks including Deutsche Bank and BofA said on Friday they expect another 75 basis point rate hike from the European Central Bank in October, a day after the central bank delivered a supersized interest-rate rise of that size to tame inflation.

The ECB raised its key rates by an unprecedented 75 basis points (bps) on Thursday and promised further hikes, prioritizing the fight against inflation even as the bloc is likely heading towards a winter recession and gas rationing. read more

""It is likely to be another close call in October and we have shifted our view to expect another 75 bps hike,"" Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note, from its previous call of 50 bps.

They noted guidance from ECB chief Christine Lagarde that rates are ""far away"" from levels appropriate for getting inflation back to target in a timely fashion and that hikes should be anticipated at the ""next several meetings.""

""This underscores the ECB's insensitivity to the growth headwinds and laser focus on bringing inflation down,"" the Deutsche note said. read more

BofA and Credit Suisse said they had also revised up their calls for a 75 bps ECB rate hike in October versus previous expectations for a 50 bps move.

Credit Suisse noted the ECB's language pointed to more aggressive tightening ahead, and also lifted its forecast for the ECB rates to peak at 2.5%, from a previous estimate of 2%.

Money markets were on Friday fully pricing in a 50 bps rate hike in October and implied a roughly 25% chance of a more aggressive 75 bps move.

Still, anticipation of a more hawkish stance from the ECB appeared to be supporting the euro, which was trading back above $1 on Friday.

BofA analysts added that faster and more aggressive tightening now would likely force the ECB to cut rates earlier.

""We now pencil in the first 25bp cut by June 2024, with two additional 25bp cuts in September and December,"" BofA said.

Citi said it continued to expect a 75 bps ECB hike in October and a 50bp hike to 2% in December before the weak economy stops further hikes.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank raised interest rates by an unprecedented 75 basis points on Thursday to tame runaway inflation, even as a recession is now increasingly likely as the bloc has lost access to vital Russian natural gas.

The ECB lifted its deposit rate to 0.75% from zero and raised the main refinancing rate to 1.25%, their highest level since 2011, as inflation is becoming increasingly broad and was at risk of getting entrenched.

""Over the next several meetings the Governing Council expects to raise interest rates further to dampen demand and guard against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations,"" the ECB said in a statement.

The move comes after weeks of canvassing by policymakers, with a seeming majority making the case for a 75 basis-point hike and a few policy doves trying to downgrade expectations.

Markets, however, sided with the conservatives and priced in an 80% likelihood of a 75 basis-point move, even as economists polled by Reuters were more evenly split, showing only a slight majority expecting the larger move.

The large hike comes as the ECB increased its own inflation forecasts and continues to see price growth well above its 2% target throughout its entire projection horizon.

""ECB staff have significantly revised up their inflation projections and inflation is now expected to average 8.1% in 2022, 5.5% in 2023 and 2.3% in 2024,"" the ECB added.

Conservatives feared that anything but an oversized move would signal that the ECB was not serious about its inflation-fighting mandate. That risked pushing up already high long-term inflation expectations, which would signal a loss of confidence in the ECB.

Timid action would have also weakened the euro, boosting inflation through more expensive energy imports.

Frontloading the rate hikes also allows the ECB to get most of the work done before the recession sets in.

Attention now turns to ECB President Christine Lagarde's 1245 GMT news conference.

b7409412-df82-4d3e-9085-30cd6d574d37,"Stocks and bond yields have shuffled higher while the euro slipped back under parity, as investors wait to see if the European Central Bank would fight runaway inflation later with a record 75 basis point interest rate hike, or go smaller.

A drop in oil below $US90 ($A134) a barrel, growing speculation about Japanese FX market intervention and an expected UK energy price plan later meant traders had plenty on their plates before the ECB's 1215 GMT decision.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose a modest 0.2 per cent as cyclical sectors including miners and banks and insurers that benefit from higher interest rates gained between 1.0 per cent and 1.1 per cent.

Bond and currency markets showed little definitive direction though. The euro wilted back under 1-to-1 to the dollar following its 15 per cent slump this year, while government bond market yields turned higher again after an initial move lower.

Paul Hollingsworth, chief European economist at BNP Paribas Markets 360, said markets were largely expecting a 75 basis point ECB hike following recent signals from some of its top policymakers.

""The fact that we are not at the peak of inflation in Europe yet is important here,"" he said.

""If they do deliver the 75 bps, it is likely that we will see more hikes priced in and we could see the euro rally a bit, but we would look to fade that,"" he added, due to the upcoming recession and winter energy crisis.

The euro slipped 0.19 per cent to $US0.9988 ($A1.4850), after hitting a 20-year low of $0.9864 earlier in the week.

Britain's pound was also in the red again, with the UK's new Prime Minister Liz Truss set to announce a STG100 billion ($A171 billion)-plus package of measures later to cap soaring consumer and business energy bills.

The extra spending has sparked worries about the UK's debts, although an energy price cap could at least bring the peak in UK inflation down to 10 per cent from 15 per cent, Hollingsworth said.

Having hit its lowest level since 1985 on Wednesday, the pound was at $US1.1498 ($A1.7095), down 0.3 per cent on the day - and like the euro - 15 per cent lower for the year.

Overnight, Asian stocks made broad gains as oil prices dropped to levels not seen since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, though China was an exception as weak data signalled more pressure on the COVID-hit economy.

Japan's Nikkei share average jumped 2.3 per cent, breaking through the psychological barrier at 28,000 points for the first time this month as domestic exporters saw boosts from the weaker yen.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.3 per cent, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 gained 1.7 per cent.

Chinese blue chips fell 0.3 per cent after the release of worse-than-expected trade data on Wednesday and an extension of the lockdown in the city of Chengdu that demonstrated no let-up in the country's strict zero-COVID policy.

""Today for Asia it's really a story of whether zero-COVID will continue to impact the Chinese economy, which will of course have a spillover effect in terms of imports,"" said Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis in Hong Kong.

Markets were also awaiting a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell later in the day for signs of any let-up in the US central bank's approach to tackling its rising inflation.

CME Group's Fedwatch tool currently shows that expectations for a third successive 75-basis-point interest rate hike are at about 76 per cent, up from 69 per cent a week ago.

""The markets will probably adopt a wait-and-see approach in the short run,"" said Ng.

""Whether it's 50 or 75 basis points will be important, but the most important thing is really about whether inflation can peak, and what is the rate hike path of the Fed going forward?""

The yen was hovering just below 144 per US dollar after weakening almost as far as 145 overnight.

Japan is ready to take action to deal with swift moves in the yen, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiji Kihara said on Thursday, repeating the government's verbal warnings as the currency hovered around 24-year lows.

""We're worried about rapid and one-sided moves in the currency market,"" Kihara told a news conference.

""If such moves continue, we would like to take necessary action,"" he said, fanning speculation of possible FX market intervention.

The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of currencies of other major trading partners, was up slightly at 109.73.

Oil prices recovered slightly from an overnight plunge but remained below $US90 ($A134) a barrel for the first time since early February on worries about global recession risks.

US crude was down 0.5 per cent to $US81.51 ($A121.19) a barrel, while Brent crude drifted back to $US87.38 ($A129.91) per barrel in early European trading."

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank raised its key interest rates by an unprecedented 75 basis points on Thursday and promised further hikes, prioritising the fight against inflation even as the bloc is likely heading towards a winter recession and gas rationing.

With inflation at a half-century high and approaching double-digit territory, policymakers are worried that rapid price growth is getting entrenched, melting away household savings, thwarting investment and setting off a hard-to-break wage-price spiral.

Following up on a large July rate hike, the ECB raised its deposit rate to 0.75% from zero and lifted its main refinancing rate to 1.25%, the highest level for both since 2011, with moves promised for the next several meetings.

Still, the ECB is trailing many of its peers, particularly the U.S. Federal Reserve, in raising interest rates and some analysts see the oversized steps since July as an attempt to catch up.

""We expect to raise interest rates further, because inflation remains far too high and is likely to stay above our target for an extended period,"" ECB chief Christine Lagarde said, adding that Thursday's decision was unanimous.

""We think it will take several meetings,"" she said. ""How many is several? It’s probably more than two, including this one, but it’s probably also going to be less than five,"" Lagarde said, suggesting that rate hikes could continue into early 2023.

GRAPHICS:ECB monetary policy: https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-CENTRALBANKS/gkvlgnlyxpb/chart.png

Policymakers had for weeks oscillated between a 50 and a 75 basis-point increase, but another jump in both headline and underlying inflation likely settled the debate with Lagarde repeatedly arguing that the current high level was simply unacceptable.

When asked about future moves, Lagarde said 75 basis points is not the norm and future moves could be smaller but she also declined to rule out a similarly large move in the future.

Story continues

""We continue to expect it to raise its deposit rate to 1.75% by the beginning of next year, but to pause the rate hike process after that because of the recession that will then be visible,"" Commerzbank economist Jörg Krämer said.

""To put a lasting brake on inflation, the ECB would even have to go beyond that, because inflation is massively above its target,"" Krämer added.

GRAPHIC: Central banks ramp up flight against inflation https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-CENTRALBANKS/lgvdwdozzpo/chart.png

Inflation jumped to 9.1% in August and the ECB's new projections predict a peak near this level just before the end of the year, even if some market analysts see it over 10% soon.

Still, these projections put price growth over the bank's 2% target for years to come with the 2023 projection raised to 5.5%from 3.5% and 2024 seen at 2.3%, above the 2% target.

Markets, which saw Thursday's move as very likely, now price a little more than a 50 basis-point interest rate increase for October and a similar hike in December.

""Where we are is not the neutral rate,"" Lagarde said. ""We are heading in that direction. It takes frontloading. It will take further hikes in the next several meetings.""

The ECB's growth projections, sharply cut for next year, expect economic stagnation over the winter months but many of the potential downside risks, particularly the loss of Russian gas, has already materialised.

GRAPHIC: The race to raise rates https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-CENTRALBANKS/gdvzyxmlnpw/chart.png

""We see today's decision in favour of the larger step as a signal to markets that the central bank is serious about regaining its inflation-fighting credentials and that it is willing to accept costs in terms of lower growth to ensure price stability,"" Morgan Stanley said in a note.

In the ECB's baseline scenario, the economy would expand by 0.9% next year while in the downside, it could shrink by 0.9%.

This downside scenario would, however, push inflation even higher, to 2.7% in 2024 as the drag from an economic downturn would be far outweighed by persistently high natural gas prices.

The euro's weakness may have also been a consideration on Thursday.

The euro has been languishing around parity against the dollar for weeks and its sharp fall to two-decade lows this year adds to import costs and raises inflation.

Lagarde added that while running down its oversized balance sheet, as done by some of its peers, could be on the agenda at one point, it is for now concentrating on interest rates as an instrument.

By Caroline Valetkevitch

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stocks and government bond yields rose on Thursday after the European Central Bank raised interest rates by a record 75 basis points and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the U.S. central bank was ""strongly committed"" to controlling inflation.

The ECB also signalled further hikes to fight inflation, even as the bloc's economy is heading for a likely winter recession.

Euro zone government bond yields jumped in the wake of the ECB news. Benchmark 10-year Treasury note yields rose following Powell's remarks and were last at 3.32%. last at when?

The U.S. 10-year yields have risen from a four-month low of 2.516% on Aug. 2, but are holding below the 11-year high of 3.498% reached on June 14. Two-year yields increased four basis points to 3.491%.

In currencies, the dollar gained versus the yen on Powell's hawkish stance, while sterling fell against the dollar after Queen Elizabeth, Britain's longest-reigning monarch and the nation's figurehead for seven decades, died.

At a Cato Institute conference, Powell also said inflation can be controlled without the ""very high social costs"" involved previously.

Worries that central banks will remain hawkish and inflation will remain persistently high has sent government bond yields higher globally in recent weeks.

Wall Street stocks initially fell in the wake of his remarks but then reversed course to end with solid gains, helped by rate-sensitive banks and healthcare company shares. The S&P 500 bank index jumped 2.8%.

""It was a volatile session. But the key point is that we're holding onto yesterday's gains in lieu of the fact that the ECB raised its rates by 75 basis points and obviously took a very hawkish stand on fighting inflation, and we heard the same (hawkish) commentary from Mr. Powell this morning,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.

""There was nothing new"" in Powell's comments, he said. ""It's a known fact that the central banks are inducing a global recession. The question is will it be a steep one or a mild one. My guess is it will be a mild one.""

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 193.24 points, or 0.61%, to 31,774.52, the S&P 500 gained 26.31 points, or 0.66%, to 4,006.18 and the Nasdaq Composite added 70.23 points, or 0.6%, to 11,862.13.

Banks also led European stocks higher. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.50% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.76%.

Chicago Fed President Charles Evans also said on Thursday that getting high inflation down is ""job one,"" and to do so the Fed could raise interest rates by another 75 basis points this month.

Fed officials are heading into a blackout period before their Sept. 20 to 21 meeting, when they are expected to raise the fed funds rate by another 75 basis points, increasing it to 3.0% to 3.25%. to or from?

""It's important to remember the lesson we all learned years ago, and that's don't fight the Fed,"" said Oliver Pursche, senior vice president at Wealthspire Advisors in New York. ""And the Fed is telling us that they're laser-focused on inflation.""

In afternoon New York trading, the dollar rose 0.1% to 143.96 yen, climbing in nine of the last 10 sessions. On Tuesday, it surged to a 24-year peak of 144.99 yen.

The euro dropped 0.1% to $0.9994.

The yen has been a victim of recent dollar strength, as the Bank of Japan remains the lone dovish central bank.

Sterling was last trading at $1.1502, about flat on the day.

Crude prices edged up about 1% after dropping to a seven-month low in the prior session.

Brent futures rose $1.15, or 1.3%, to settle at $89.15 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 rose $1.60, or 2.0%, to settle at $83.54.

Winter Gas Shortages in Europe Likely to Last 3 to 5 Years, Commodities Expert Says

Europe, which is currently reeling under an energy crisis, could see winter gas shortages last another three years at a minimum, according to Ed Morse, global head of commodities research at Citigroup.

“It’ll be somewhere between 2025 and 2027 that we’ll see the prices in Europe coming back to where they were at the beginning of 2021,” Morse said in an interview with Bloomberg while pointing out that the capacity for liquified natural gas (LNG) exports doesn’t “grow overnight.” Europe’s current energy crisis has been triggered by Russia curtailing its natural gas deliveries to the region as retaliation for sanctions imposed on Moscow for invading Ukraine.

With the decline in Russian gas imports, reserves are likely to get used up faster in the coming winter. This will make preparing gas reserves for the next few winters an even more difficult task.

According to Niek den Hollander, chief commercial officer at German energy giant Uniper SE, many nations in Europe might not be able to fill up their gas storage sites next summer to the extent that they have done this year, thus presenting a problem next winter.

Europe’s energy ministers are due to meet on Sept. 9 to discuss the energy crisis in the region, including measures to bring costs under control, caps on natural gas prices, and even suspending derivatives trading in the power sector.

Ratings agency Fitch is expecting the European Union’s plan of boosting alternative gas supplies and reducing gas usage by 15 percent in 2023 to help avoid acute shortages on the continent.

However, the EU winter gas supply and demand situation continues to be plagued by several uncertainties, including the war in Ukraine, LNG supplies, and temperatures, Fitch stated.

Financial Worries

The gas supply crisis and resulting price surge are putting financial pressure on Europe’s economy. On Sept. 5, the Dutch TTF October gas contract rose to 272 euros per megawatt hour after Russia announced that one of its gas supply pipelines servicing Europe would remain indefinitely shut down. This is up by about 400 percent compared to a year ago.

European companies are now requesting at least 1.5 trillion euros in government liquidity to cover their margin calls.

Energy firms usually require companies to pay a margin deposit before supplying power. With gas supplies being curtailed, the minimum deposit price has surged, putting many companies in a financially difficult position.

“This has had the ingredients for a kind of a Lehman Brothers of energy industry,” said Finland’s Minister of Economic Affairs Mika Lintila, referring to the 1.5 trillion-euro plan to fund power companies.

Italy, which relies on imports for three-quarters of its power consumption, is set to see energy import costs more than double in 2022, the country’s economy minister recently said."

The biggest US exporter of liquefied natural gas warned that limited supplies worldwide mean this winter ""could be really, really tight.""

Cheniere, which has sent 70% of its output to Europe this year, also said a resurgence in Chinese LNG demand would worsen the energy crisis in Europe, where natural gas deliveries from Russia's Nord Stream pipeline remain cut off.

""At the end of the day, what's going to decide how tight the market will be is how cold it is and how government policies, industry rationing work,"" Corey Grindal, Cheniere's executive vice president for worldwide trading, told Reuters.

For now, the current price environment indicates LNG supplies will continue to go to Europe, he added.

Prices were $2 per million British thermal unit in 2020 and have soared 2,750% to $57 per million BTUs in August.

The US has taken advantage of elevated prices in Europe thanks to Russia's invasion of Ukraine this year, and has stepped up exports of the super-chilled fuel.

China is also sending LNG to Europe as zero-COVID policies are still weighing on domestic demand. Traders told Bloomberg that major shippers including Sinopec and PetroChina Co have sold shipments of LNG to to struggling European nations throughout the year.

Meanwhile, both the European Union and the UK are seeking to cap gas prices and trying to curb consumption. But a total Russian gas shutoff would send Europe into an energy crisis that would last multiple winters, according to RBC's global commodity chief Helima Croft."

Smaller company stocks also gained ground after an initial pullback. The Russell 2000 rose 14.90 points, or 0.8%, to 1,846.91.

The Fed has already raised rates four times this year and markets expect it to deliver another jumbo-sized increase of three-quarters of a percentage point at its next meeting in two weeks.

Powell “sounded very resolute in the (Fed’s) mission to squelch inflation, and as a result, probably gave more credence to the possibility of a 75-basis point hike at the September meeting,” Stovall said.

One of the Fed’s biggest fears is that households and businesses begin to expect inflation to stay high in the long term, which could lead them to start buying in a way that creates a vicious cycle making inflation even harder to shake.

The Fed has caught criticism for not taking inflation seriously sooner, and Powell said that setting interest-rate policy is an art as much of a science. A big question remains about whether the high inflation ravaging economies around the world is a one-off created by the pandemic or the start of something more persistent.

Bond yields rose broadly as traders weighed Powell’s remarks and the ECB’s rate hike. The two-year Treasury yield, which tends to track expectations for Fed action, rose to 3.52% from 3.44%. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which influences interest rates on mortgages and other loans, rose to 3.32% from 3.27% late Tuesday.

1e4db0e1-81ed-48bb-9a0a-e93cebc0ee40,"Morgan Stanley analyst Andrew McLeod said at the time of the results that capital markets have permanently changed, meaning companies need to do more than increase top-line revenue without focusing on generating cash and being profitable.

“Tyro outlined plans today for its path to profitability; we believe it is the correct strategy, but there is still work to do to achieve it and still risks in the competitive payments market,” Mr McLeod said.

Tyro shares battered

“Looking ahead, the major potential upside we see comes from industry consolidation, which is hard to forecast,”

The takeover approach comes after Tyro shares have been battered, losing 66 per cent over the past year to last close at 98¢ and are down from a 52-week high of $4.39.

In rejecting the bid, the Tyro board said it was materially below the company’s fundamental value and highly opportunistic given the shares have traded much higher over the past 12 months, was highly conditional, and did not recognise Tyro’s growth prospects and strong funding position to support its growth.

QVG Capital portfolio manager and Tyro shareholder Chris Prunty also dismissed the bid as opportunistic.

“It’s an opportunistic bid and an easy one for the board to reject at that price,” he said.

“Tyro doesn’t have and has never had a revenue problem. It does, however, have an outrageous cost base and that’s the opportunity for the bidder.”

It is understood Potentia might seek to close down Tyro’s lending business, where the increasing cost of funds as the interest rate cycle turns is expected to keep its returns from a relatively small lending book low and costs high.

The move would also allow Tyro to refocus on its fintech core in payments innovation. However, a strategic buyer could be attracted to its banking licence.

Sources said the way the Grok acceptance deed is structured could be designed to put the company in play for a strategic buyer from the financial services or payments industry, which can extract cost savings through a merger or buyout.

One investor said the inclusion of the 25¢ threshold indicated Potentia expected to pay more than the $1.27 offered.

“Tyro is a lot more advanced than a lot of other tech businesses, so it makes sense that people would be looking at it,” he said.

UBS analyst Tim Piper said the recent departure of Tyro chief executive Robbie Cooke, who will head casino group Star Entertainment, increased the odds of a private equity takeover. But he hinted the banking licence held by Tyro and its strong positioning in other lines of business could make it an attractive target to other players.

“We thought the chance of a takeover offer from PE was possible but modest, noting the recent resignation of CEO Robbie Cooke likely did increase the odds,” Mr Piper said.

“We can see the angle here, and it likely revolves a lot around operating cost reduction opportunities. But Tyro also has a strong market position within its core verticals and is an early-stage SME lending business which holds a banking licence.”

In his bull case scenario with a share price target of $2.50, versus the $1.40 base case price target, Morgan Stanley’s Mr McLeod pointed to offshore industry consolidation seen in US Global Payments’s $US4 billion ($6 billion) acquisition of EVO Payments.

“We still see an opportunity for Tyro to create significant shareholder value and believe recent M & A in the US sector highlights the potential,” Mr McLeod said."

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan is ready to take action to deal with swift moves in the yen, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiji Kihara said on Thursday, repeating the government's verbal warnings as the currency hovered around 24-year lows.

""We're worried about rapid and one-sided moves in the currency market,"" Kihara told a news conference. ""If such moves continue, we would like to take necessary action,"" he said.

When asked about the possibility of conducting yen-buying intervention, Kihara said he would not comment on specific views held in markets.

The dollar hit a 24-year high of 144.99 yen on Wednesday as investors focused on the policy divergence between the U.S. Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hikes and the Bank of Japan's resolve to keep ultra-loose monetary policy.

In a sign of Tokyo's alarm over the yen's relentless fall, officials from the Ministry of Finance (MOF), Bank of Japan (BOJ) and Financial Services Agency (FSA) are holding a meeting on Thursday to discuss global financial markets.

The meeting is held occasionally and on an ad hoc basis, usually to signal to markets the government's concern over rapid exchange rate moves.

The dollar briefly dropped to 143.65 yen on Thursday after the MOF announced its plan to hold the trilateral meeting, before bouncing back to around 144.09 yen.

Once welcomed for boosting exports, the yen's weakness is becoming a headache for Japanese policymakers, because it drives up the cost of importing already expensive fuel and raw materials.

TOKYO--Japan's top currency official said Thursday that the government isn't ruling out any options as it weighs a response to the yen's recent sharp fall.

Masato Kanda, vice finance minister for international affairs, called the yen's fall excessive and blamed it on speculative activity, saying the sudden drop couldn't be justified by market fundamentals.

He spoke to reporters after meeting with officials from the Bank of Japan and the Financial Services Agency. It was the first time since June that the three parties had met to discuss market conditions.

""The government and the Bank of Japan are extremely concerned about these movements,"" Mr. Kanda said.

He said the government was prepared to take action if the movements continue and would ""not rule out any measures."" Asked whether that included intervening in currency markets to sell dollars and buy yen, he reiterated that all options are on the table.

The yen has hit a fresh low this week, falling to 144 to the dollar as investors expect U.S.-Japan interest rate differentials to continue to widen. The yen has lost more than 20% of its value against the dollar since the beginning of the year.

In Thursday's trading in Tokyo, the yen recovered slightly to around 143.60 to the dollar when news of the meeting emerged, but then fell back to 144 to the dollar after Mr. Kanda didn't name any specific actions that Japan planned to take in response to the weak yen.

The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates by 0.75 percentage point later this month to fight inflation. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan has repeatedly said it isn't ready to tighten monetary policy.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan need not intervene in the exchange-rate market to stem yen falls, as such a move would be ineffective in countering broad dollar gains, former top currency diplomat Hiroshi Watanabe told Reuters on Wednesday.

The dollar reached a fresh 24-year peak against the yen and new highs versus some other currencies on Wednesday after U.S. economic data reinforced the view that the Federal Reserve would continue aggressive policy tightening.

""The dollar/yen seems to be overshooting somewhat now, and could briefly touch 145 later this month. But such a move likely won't last long,"" said Watanabe, who is now the president of Institute for International Monetary Affairs.

Watanabe oversaw Japan's currency policy from 2004 to 2007 and retains close contact with incumbent policymakers in and outside of Japan.

The dollar jumped to 143.57 yen early in the Asian day before extending gains to trade at 144.38. The move raised some speculation about the possibility of official market intervention to stem the yen's weakness.

However, Watanabe shrugged off the idea.

""The government doesn't need to respond, even if the dollar briefly touches 140 or 145 yen. It also doesn't need to conduct operations (to smooth market volatility), as exchange-rate moves are driven by broad dollar gains,"" he said, specifically ruling out the chance of Tokyo conducting solo yen-buying intervention.

The BOJ has kept interest rates near zero and has pledged to keep doing so. But some market players think it could allow the 10-year yield to rise above the target or raise short-term rates so the rate gap between the United States and Japan narrows, helping to support the yen.

However, Watanabe said there was also no need for the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates to stem the weak yen.

""I don't think the Bank of Japan would do such a foolish thing to raise interest rates to stem the yen weakness. Doing that would be like declaring that it will conduct monetary policy with no logic at all.""

The yen's recent values contrast with its standing in 2011, when Japan last intervened in the market - at that time selling yen and buying dollars. In that year its trading range was approximately 85 per dollar to 75 per dollar.

""I don't think the days of a very strong yen will ever return. Much of the weakness of the yen reflects a decline in confidence of Japan's economic strength, not interest rate differentials.""

Some of Japan’s most senior politicians cranked the volume on the dial marked “verbal intervention” to max. Traders barely noticed. Both Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki and top government spokesman Hirokazu Matsuno threatened “action” Wednesday if the yen’s weak trend continued — code for currency intervention. Whether traders noticed or cared, however, was impossible to tell from watching the currency: It renewed fresh 24-year lows against the dollar, going right up against 145 to the greenback.

It’s a far cry from the days when the trading world would hang on every word from Japanese officials, parsing the nuance of carefully judged statements and watching the motions of officials in the 1990s such as “Mr. Yen” Eisuke Sakakibara, the Finance Ministry’s top currency official. His successor was Haruhiko Kuroda — now governor of the Bank of Japan and, if not the architect of the current situation, then at least helping out with the blueprints.

Despite his mouthful of a title, the current vice minister of finance for international affairs, Masato Kanda, has little to say about the yen’s moves and holds a far lower profile. But this week’s actions show that verbal intervention just isn’t the force it used to be. Japan has been out of the yen game so long that traders might no longer know how to parse the clear step-up statements officials gave Wednesday. After all, a generation has passed since traders last saw Japan try to strengthen the currency.

It’s more likely, though, that the market sees Japan’s hands are tied. Unlike its many past attempts to weaken the yen, Tokyo has limited foreign currency ammunition. With seemingly no US backing for a coordinated intervention and little public pressure to fix the situation, it looks likely that Prime Minister Fumio Kishida will adopt his standard cautious approach and wait for things to correct themselves, just as the yen did this summer.

Of course, Japan could choose to fire a warning shot. Intervention is often seen as a losing battle, destined to fail — but it all depends on the goal. If the idea is to produce a sustained change in behavior, good luck. Robert Rubin, who as US Treasury secretary presided over rare joint action in June 1998 to prop up the yen, was skeptical that market maneuvers by governments could set the long-term trajectory of a currency. “Ultimately, currencies follow fundamentals,” Rubin said at the time.

But if the plan is to inject two-way risk into trading, cushion a currency’s drop or stem an advance, then authorities can sometimes eke out a tactical victory. The issue that plagued the yen back in the 1990s was a banking crisis. Things are different now; the biggest single driver of the slide is the canyon between interest rates in the US and Japan. That’s only likely to widen if, as seems likely, Kuroda sticks to his guns of maintaining an easy monetary stance.

What other options does Japan then have? Every dollar surge comes with wistful allusions to the Plaza Accord, the 1985 agreement that engineered a steep drop in the dollar, as well as a rally in the yen and the West German mark. But Plaza was primarily a political document: Then-US Treasury boss James Baker, one of the most powerful people to ever occupy that office, was trying to contain protectionist sentiment in Congress.

America’s role as guarantor of the West’s security meant Baker could easily get his way. China’s economy was tiny, and the Soviet bloc had little by way of capital markets. With interest rates on their way down in the US and Japan enjoying a growth spurt but butting heads with Washington on trade, both fundamentals and politics seemed to align. A Plaza equivalent now would have to involve an almost hopelessly large coalition of nations whose interests won’t match.

Should Kishida then exert pressure on the Bank of Japan to act, and reduce the interest-rate differential? That path is simple to envisage but harder to carry out: The economy couldn’t withstand the hit of even a small rate hike, while in the US, the Fed looks determined to keep raising and choke out inflation. A minor tweak to policy would likely only encourage those betting on change. In any case, would such a move impact either the currency or Japan’s mild inflation? Kuroda is among those who don’t think so.

Perhaps the solution for Japan is, just most of us have done with Covid, to learn to live with things. The weak yen presents challenges, yes — but at least now isn’t an explosive political issue akin to the cost of living crisis in the UK. Ties between the Unification Church and some in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, brought to light after the killing of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, dominate the headlines in Japan, not pain at the checkout.

The weak yen also presents opportunities. Kishida has already identified one, even if he’s yet to fully act on it: There’s no better time to reinstate Japan as a major tourism destination. No country in the world has as many people lining up at the borders to come in and drop cash. Japan should reinstate visa waivers suspended due to the pandemic, properly open up, and profit.

The prime minister could take it one step further too, and expand tax benefits to both domestic and overseas firms to base their manufacturing in Japan, where labor is now both skilled and cost-effective The country might have to accept that in this era, both talk and the yen are cheap.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's government wants to act if ""rapid, one-sided"" moves seen in the currency market recently continue, the country's top government spokesperson warned on Wednesday as the yen slid to a fresh 24-year low.

The comments marked officials' latest verbal warning against the fall of the yen, which weakened beyond 144 yen per dollar after slumping about 1.5% on Tuesday.

""I'm concerned about rapid, one-sided moves in the currency market recently,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told reporters at a news briefing, using stronger language about the yen's fall than officials' remarks earlier this week.

The government ""would like to take necessary steps if such movements continue,"" he said, adding that sharp fluctuations were not desirable. He made the comments before the yen hit a fresh low.

Such official remarks, called jawboning in foreign exchange markets, are intended to make traders cautious by implying the authorities may intervene.

When asked later on Wednesday whether a government response may include foreign exchange market intervention, Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki declined to comment, keeping mum on what any possible response may look like.

Former top currency diplomat Hiroshi Watanabe, meanwhile, told Reuters the government did not need to intervene to stem yen falls, as such a move would be ineffective in countering broad dollar gains.

The Japanese currency, which dropped as low as 144.38 per dollar on Wednesday, has lost about 20% since the start of the year, driven lower mainly by divergence in monetary policy between Japan and the United States.

""The dollar/yen seems to be overshooting somewhat now and could briefly touch 145 later this month. But such a move likely won't last long,"" Watanabe said, adding the government did not need to respond even if the dollar did briefly reach 145 yen.

The government ""also doesn't need to conduct operations (to smooth market volatility) as exchange-rate moves are driven by broad dollar gains,"" he added.

POLICY DIVERGENCE

The main reason for the yen's fall from around 115 per dollar since the start of the year has been a growing gap between U.S. interest rates and the ultra-low levels maintained by the Bank of Japan (BOJ).

The Japanese central bank has vowed to stick to its powerful monetary stimulus and is widely expected to do so. Ex-BOJ board member Goushi Kataoka told Reuters it was unlikely to shift its stance even as inflation is seen reaching 3% in coming months, well above the BOJ target of 2%.

The Federal Reserve, on the other hand, is expected to continue raising interest rates for the time being.

""As long as the BOJ maintains its current policy, it'll be very hard for the Japanese side to turn this tide,"" said Bart Wakabayashi, co-branch manager for State Street Bank.

Japan last intervened by selling the dollar and buying the yen in the foreign exchange market in June 1998 when the yen fell beyond 146 per dollar.

""Intervention has often proved to be a temporary break, and not so much to change the market mindset,"" Wakabayashi added.

LONDON, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Britain's struggling currency will not regain its losses against the U.S. dollar anytime soon as steep interest rate increases from the Bank of England fail to offset an expected recession and increased government spending, a Reuters poll found.

Liz Truss, appointed prime minister on Tuesday, faces a daunting list of problems, steering Britain through a likely lengthy recession and an energy crisis that threatens the finances of millions of households and businesses. read more

Adding to the woes of indebted households facing soaring costs, the Bank of England is expected to lift borrowing costs by another bumper 50 basis points next month having already raised Bank Rate from 0.10% to 1.75%.

On the flip side, the dollar was expected to benefit from U.S. interest rate rises, an economy outperforming its peers and its safe-haven appeal.

Sterling , down about 15% this year and wallowing around 2-1/2 year lows against the dollar, was expected to hover near Tuesday's $1.16 level in one and three months time, the Sept. 1-6 poll of nearly 60 foreign exchange strategists predicted.

""Recent sterling price action has been striking partly for its resemblance to some emerging markets - higher inflation, higher rates, and a falling currency,"" noted Goldman Sachs.

""Our baseline assumption is that the most rapid phase of Sterling underperformance is now behind us.""

In six months the pound will have risen to $1.18 and in a year to $1.23, the poll found, still far short of the $1.35 it started 2022 around.

But when asked what rate the lowest the pound would fall to within the next three months the median response was $1.14. If it does go below $1.1413 it would be its weakest since 1985.

""Cable in our view is likely to weaken further as inflation prospects in Britain are quite worrisome,"" said Roberto Mialich at UniCredit.

""The Bank of England is likely to hike further but real rates we expect to widen further, to the detriment of sterling.""

Analysts at Deutsche Bank said they expect spending pledges of around 100 billion pounds ($115.26 billion)from Truss, about a quarter of what was spent to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic, which would likely lead to further inflation and the need for the BoE to respond.

Against the common currency the pound will trade broadly flat from where it was on Tuesday. In one month a euro will fetch 85.9 pence and in a year 86.0p, the poll found.

The pound (GBPUSD=X) suffered its biggest monthly fall against the dollar since 2016 in August, as investors retreated to safe-haven assets in the face of a looming recession.

Sterling declined 4.5% against the US greenback, while it was also down almost 3% against the euro (GBPEUR=X).

It was the sharpest monthly fall since October 2016, in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.

It comes as the UK economy faces a bleak outlook for the rest of the year, with surging inflation and rising energy bills threatening to drive Britain into a recession.

The pound extended its fall into the month of September, dropping to a two-and-a-half year low against the dollar of $1.1558 — its fifth straight day of declines. A fall below $1.1412 would take the pound to its weakest level since 1985.

On Thursday, the Resolution Foundation further highlighted the troubled state of the UK economy, warning that the UK faces the biggest squeeze in living standards for a century, wiping out all real pay growth since 2003.

The group added that the number of people living in absolute poverty is set to rise by 3 million, with relative child poverty projected to reach 33% in 2026-27 — its highest level since the peaks of the 1990s.

""Our economic prospects are not looking particularly good compared to the rest of the world,"" said Laura Lambie, senior investment director at Investec.

Meanwhile, Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said a ""bleak winter"" lies ahead.

“Grim forecasts about poverty spreading across the UK this winter highlight the deepening woes for the UK economy. With such a bleak winter ahead, the pound has been pummelled to fresh lows against the dollar, with sterling dipping below $1.16, to $1.157,"" she said.

“This latest drop has rounded off a torrid month for the pound which has fallen by more than 5% against the dollar in August.

“It’s partly because of the higher interest rate expectations in the US, while in the UK the Bank of England might be forced to slow down rate rises in the months to come, given that Britain faces the deepest living standards squeeze in a century.""

(Reuters) - The death of Bed Bath & Beyond Inc's chief financial officer, who fell from New York's Tribeca skyscraper known as the ""Jenga"" tower on Friday afternoon, has been ruled a suicide, the New York City Medical Examiner's Office said on Monday.

Gustavo Arnal, 52, died from ""multiple"" blunt force trauma, the office said.

The suicide came days after the struggling retailer announced it was closing stores and laying off workers.

It also comes after Arnal as well as the company were sued on Aug. 23 over accusations of artificially inflating the firm's stock price in a ""pump and dump"" scheme, with the lawsuit alleging Arnal sold off his shares at a higher price after the scheme.

The company said it was ""in the early stages of evaluating the complaint, but based on current knowledge the company believes the claims are without merit.""

There has been a major disruption at the boardroom level at the one-time retail giant. In June, chief executive Mark Tritton and chief merchandising officer Joe Hartsig left on the same day. A week before Arnal's suicide, the company's COO John Hartman resigned.

Arnal jumped to his death from the 18th floor of a 57-story building in Manhattan's Tribeca neighborhood Friday

Gustavo Arnal, 52, was facing sued one week before he died for allegedly inflating the price of Bed Bath & Beyond shares in a get-rich-quick scheme

Arnal's death leaves billionaire investor Ryan Cohen left to answer for an alleged 'pump and dump' scheme at Bed Bath & Beyond.

Cohen was accused of masterminding the operation to artificially inflate the price of the company's stock before cashing out.

A lawsuit claims he approached Arnal to release 'materially misleading statements and omissions' about the company's financial standing.

This was before they allegedly cashed out and caused the price to plummet, leaving other shareholders out of around $1.2billion.

But the alleged plot came to an end when Arnal jumped from the 18th floor of the famous 'Jenga' building in New York City on Friday.

In August 16, Cohen filed a document to the Securities and Exchange Commission saying he owned 9,450,100 shares, including 1,670,100 shares under certain call options

Arnal plunged to his death from the 18th floor of the swanky so-called Jenga building in Manhattan's Tribeca neighborhood (pictured)

The lawsuit, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on August 23, claims Cohen had approached Arnal about a plan to control shares of Bed Bath & Beyond so they could both profit.

The suit was filed just one week before Arnal took his own life by jumping from the 18th floor of the famous 'Jenga' tower in lower Manhattan's Tribeca neighborhood on Friday - a death that left Cohen to face the music alone.

The class action lawsuit was brought by Virginia resident Pengcheng Si on behalf of all those who purchased Bed Bath & Beyond stocks between March 25 and August 18.

They are now seeking damages for the alleged 'pump and dump' scheme, claiming Cohen offered to purchase a large stake in the company, including call options on more than 1.6 million shares with prices between $60 to $80.

In exchange, the suit alleges, Arnal would ensure that insiders would not flood the market with the stock.

He did so by making 'materially misleading statements and omissions' about the company's financial standing in an effort to artificially inflate the share price,' the suit says.

'Through mid August 2022, BBBY appeared — from the company's public statements and financial reporting to be a successful turning-around company,' it alleges.

But in reality, Arnal 'blatantly misrepresented the value and profitability of [the company] causing BBBY to report revenues that was fictitious [and] announce publicly that the company is successfully on the way spinning off BBBY to 'unlock full value' of this 'tremendous asset,'' it says.

Bed Bath & Beyond, though, was not actually doing well financially, the lawsuit claims.

Arnal, right, is accused of providing misleading statements and omissions to the public in order to keep the share prices high. He is pictured with his family

The city's EMS officials responded to the incident and were seen carrying the man's body off in a black bodybag

As part of the plan, the lawsuit claims, Arnal 'agreed to regulate all insider sales by BBBY's officers and directors to ensure that the market would not be inundated with a large number of BBBY shares at a given time.'

He then allegedly issued 'materially misleading statements made to investors regarding BBBY's strategic company plans, financial condition... and reports of shares holding and selling' to help increase share prices.

By the time Arnal sold over 42,000 shares in the company two weeks ago it was valued at $1 million, according to MarketBeat.com.

On August 16, Cohen filed a document to the Securities and Exchange Commission saying he owned 9,450,100 share, including 1,670,100 shares under certain call options.

It also claimed he held onto his April call options that would only begin to pay out if the stock hit $60 a share before January 20, 2023.

He was soon granted three seats on the board of the company, the lawsuit alleges, but had actually sold most of his shares in the company at that point.

Instead, the lawsuit claims, Cohen 'submitted [the document] for the purpose of creating [a] buying frenzy of BBBY stocks so that Cohen can finish selling his shares at [an] artificially inflated price.'

Stock prices rose 75 percent that day, the lawsuit alleges. But unbeknownst to share holders, it claims, that same day, Cohen also filed a form signifying his intent to sell the remainder of his shares and call options.

It was not disclosed to the public until the market closed the following day, when shares tumbled from a record high of $30 per share to around $22.50 a share.

Then after Arnal and Cohen filed a form saying they sold all their shares on August 16, the stock down 45 percent to $16.16.

It then continued to plummet to $8.78 on August 23 — down more than 70 percent from its high of $30 a share. By September 4, Bed Bath & Beyond was trading at just $8.63.

The lawsuit also claims that as the CFO, Arnal knew about Cohen's false filings with the SEC.

It further claims they discussed their exit strategy with JP Morgan Securities LLC before they sold off their shares.

It says they 'have done so for self-serving, improper and bad faith reasons, namely a desire to profit from the sales of their BBBY shares' and 'have violated their fiduciary duty by making false filings, issuing misleading statements and pumping and dumping BBY shares.'

The suit then claims JP Morgan Securities aided and abetted the operation 'to launder over $110 million worth of illegal insider trading proceeds.' DailyMail.com has reached out to Bed Bath & Beyond for comment.

The man, who has yet to be identified or named, was pronounced dead before leaving the scene

A second person, also unidentified, was hospitalized with minor injuries, according to a spokesperson for the FDNY. Their condition is unknown

Arnal's stock dump came the same day a 20-year-old college student made $110million by selling all of his Bed Bath & Beyond stock - but he did so just before the retailer's stock price slumped 23 percent after its second-biggest shareholder indicated plans to sell his entire holding.

Jake Freeman, an applied mathematics and economics major at the University of Southern California, invested in nearly five million Bed Bath & Beyond shares at $5.50 a share in July, spending a total of $25 million with the help of a wealthy pharmaceutical investor uncle.

As a result, he became a minority shareholder by owning around six percent of America's largest houseware goods specialty stores as it became the latest ailing retailer to see a surge in its value thanks to the ongoing 'meme stock' boom.

That sees amateur investors snap up stock in companies seen as past-their-best, helping to drive the share price up and making some lucky stockholders who sell at the right time millions of dollars.

Freeman, whose family resides in the New York City area, then roughly sold more than $130million worth of stock on August 16 similarly to Arnal, after the retailer's stock price surged to $27 a share.

Just one week after the damning lawsuit was filed, Arnal plunged to his death from the 18th floor of the swanky so-called Jenga building in Manhattan's Tribeca neighborhood.

Authorities say calls regarding the jump at 56 Leonard Street near Church Street came in at around 12:30pm Friday.

According to a lawsuit filed in federal court, majority shareholder Ryan Cohen (pictured) approached Arnal about a 'pump and dump' scheme in which they would both profit

By September 2, the company - which was once trading at over $30 a share - was trading at just $8.63

Arnal was identified as the jumper at the 57-story building - where apartments go for up to $50million - on Friday afternoon, according to the New York Post.

The city's EMS officials responded to the incident and were seen carrying the man's body off in a black bodybag.

A second person, also unidentified, was hospitalized with minor injuries, according to a spokesperson for the FDNY.

An applied mathematics and economics major at the University of Southern California, Jake Freeman, 20, made a $110million profit by selling all of his Bed Bath & Beyond stock on Tuesday, nearly a month after investing in five million company shares at $5.50 a share

A woman was seen looking distraught and crying near the building before eventually entering the ambulance. The FDNY spokesperson could not confirm the age or gender of the person hospitalized.

His death came at a difficult time for the company as it faced high inflation and a sagging economy. The company had announced plans to close 150 stores, of its roughly 900, and lay off 20 percent of staff just two days before Arnal's death.

And back in June, CEO Mark Tritton was fired after sales plunged 25 percent in the first quarter. The company has since hired Sue Gove, an independent board director, to replace him on an interim basis.

On Wednesday, she said the retailer was 'continuing to see significant positive momentum' and intended to build its 'deep heritage as a retailer.'

'While there is much work ahead, our road map is clear and we're confident that the significant changes we've announced today will have a positive impact on our performance' she said on a conference call.

The retailer also announced a plan to raise money by issuing new shares and said it had secured $500 million in new financing -- but investors took a dim view of the strategic plan, and shares fell as much as 25 percent in morning trading.

Traders on the Reddit forum WallStreetBets, who have cheered the stock in recent weeks, reacted with a mixture of stoicism and despair.

'I just wanted make money without any effort. why I have to suffer like this? why?' wrote one user on the forum.

In Wednesday's update, Bed Bath & Beyond also forecast a bigger-than-expected 26 percent slump in same-store sales for the second quarter and said it would now retain its business, which it had put up for sale.

Police remained on the scene following reports that a man jumped to his death on Friday

Gove said the retailer was 'continuing to see significant positive momentum' and intended to build its 'deep heritage as a retailer.'

Once known for providing many shoppers with 20%-off coupons, Bed Bath & Beyond revamped its merchandise in recent years to focus on private-label products including its Our Table brand cookware.

The chain is now ditching that strategy, nixing three of its private label brands, and reprioritizing national brands with labels including Calphalon, Ugg, Dyson, and Cuisinart underpinning that strategy, executives said on a conference call.

Executives said Bed Bath & Beyond is cutting about 20 percent of its corporate and supply chain workforce, and eliminating its chief operating officer and chief stores officer roles. The company has about 32,000 employees overall.

Meanwhile, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel told staff in a memo on Wednesday that ad sales were not keeping up with earlier projections and announced plans to reorganize and cut roughly 20 percent of the company's 5,600 employees.

'Unfortunately, given our current lower rate of revenue growth, it has become clear that we must reduce our cost structure to avoid incurring significant ongoing losses,' Spiegel wrote.

Snap will shut down ambitious projects, including mobile games and novelties like a flying drone camera, helping the company save an estimated $500 million in costs annually, the company said.

Investors approved of the move, with shares of Snap rising as much as 15 percent in morning trading.

Spiegel said Snap was restructuring its business to focus on community growth, revenue growth and augmented reality.

Anything that doesn't contribute to those three areas 'will be discontinued or receive substantially reduced investment,' Spiegel said."

Now that the US Federal Reserve has gone into full quantitative tightening mode, reversing an asset-buying program that had expanded its balance sheet to nearly $9 trillion, a worry is emerging: Could a disruptive cash crunch ensue, along the lines of what happened in money markets a few years ago? Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Don’t be too concerned. This time around, the Fed is much better prepared.

True, the Fed has ramped up the asset runoff to its maximum rate of $60 billion of Treasuries and $35 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities each month. As intended, this will drain liquidity that had been added to support the economy during the Covid pandemic, gradually reducing the more than $3 trillion in cash reserves that commercial banks are holding at the Fed.

Doomsayers argue that reserves will eventually fall below the banking system’s needs, causing interest rates to spike in the crucial repo market, which hedge funds and other institutions depend upon to finance securities – a repeat of the September 2019 turmoil that forced the Fed to abandon abruptly its previous effort at quantitative tightening. They point out that almost $3 trillion in reserves have already been siphoned off: more than $2 trillion to the Fed’s reverse repo facility, which takes cash in from money market mutual funds, and another $600 billion in the form of the Treasury’s large cash balance at the Fed.

Let’s start with the reverse repo facility. Institutions such as money-market funds are using it heavily now, because the Fed pays a higher interest rate (2.3%) than what they can earn by lending money in private markets. This removes reserves from the banking system, parking the money directly at the Fed. But as quantitative tightening drains excess liquidity, private market rates will firm, and banks will increase deposit rates to lure customers away from money-market funds. Together, this will reduce usage of the Fed’s facility and boost reserves, postponing the moment when they become inadequate.

The Fed has also acted on the lessons of the last money-market disruption in two crucial ways. For one, it has set up a standing repo facility to limit any interest-rate spikes: If reserves become unduly scarce for any reason, banks can replenish them by borrowing at a slightly elevated rate, against the collateral of Treasuries and other government-guaranteed debt.

Beyond that, the Fed intends to shrink reserves more carefully this time around, in three distinct phases. We’re now in the first stage, where reserves decline relatively quickly along with the runoff of the Fed’s assets. In the second and third stages — when reserves fall to 10% and 9% of gross domestic product, respectively — the asset runoff will slow and then cease. The final target will be 8% of GDP, which the Fed will maintain by managing its holdings of securities. That target, of course, can change: The ultimate aim is to ensure that the supply of reserves is always slightly above banks’ underlying demand.

Quantitative tightening might not prove quite as boring as “watching paint dry,” as Janet Yellen suggested in 2017, but it’s unlikely to cause any major disruptions. As the Fed’s balance sheet shrinks and the amount of Treasuries in private hands increases, bond yields should rise modestly. That’s about it.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors in the $23 trillion U.S. Treasury market are slicing up orders and switching to more easily traded issues, adapting to navigate periodic illiquidity that looks to get worse as the U.S. Federal Reserve reduces the size of its bond portfolio.

The Fed kicked off ""quantitative tightening"" (QT) in June, letting its bonds reach maturity without buying more. The exit of the Treasury market's largest buyer and uncertainty over future rate hikes to fight soaring inflation have led to wild price swings. Many investors have changed trading patterns, while others stay on the sidelines, according to more than half a dozen traders and investors interviewed by Reuters.

""If you're trying to move larger sizes, even $50 million or more, you're probably going to have to do it in smaller bite sizes,"" said Calvin Norris, Portfolio Manager & US Rates Strategist at Aegon Asset Management.

He said investors increasingly prefer to trade recently issued ""on-the-run"" Treasuries which are more liquid than older ""off-the-run"" ones. Liquidity is also poor for more niche products such as Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities.

The Treasuries market is the world's largest bond market and serves as a global benchmark for a swathe of other asset classes, making its price gyrations especially worrying.

Measuring liquidity by looking at the size and persistence of unexploited arbitrage opportunities in the Treasury market, investment bank Piper Sandler estimated last month the market to be ""the most illiquid it has been over the past 20 years, except of course for the Great Financial Crisis."" The following graphic is reproduced from Piper Sandler's research.

Graphic: Liquidity in US Treasuries - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/akpezkdkyvr/Pasted%20image%201661899369909.png

Trading volume has held up this year, averaging at about $630 billion per month in total. But investors said liquidity - the ability to trade an asset without significantly moving its price - has worsened.

Story continues

Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at National Alliance Securities, said that transactions of, for instance, $100 million, need to be broken down into either $25 or $50 million to be able to trade without moving prices.

""You have to break it down or you move markets against you,"" he said.

When trying to trade less liquid products, some investors said they had struggled to find dealers willing to offer quotes.

Michael Kushma, chief investment officer of Global Fixed Income at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, said at some points this year his firm had to switch out the bonds they were trying to sell, as the bid discounts dealers were offering were too steep.

So far the Fed has allowed about $70 billion of Treasuries to mature and roll off its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet, which it plans to reduce at nearly twice the pace it did from 2017 to 2019.

When the pandemic hit, the Fed bought up to $80 billion Treasuries a month to pump up the economy, but now it will ramp-up Treasury roll-offs to as much as $60 billion each month.

'LESS CAPITAL'

Market volatility and recession fears have made market makers less willing to take large positions.

""When liquidity dries up dealers don't know where the price is .. So they're reluctant to buy and to make a market in it because they don't know where they're going to sell,"" said Kushma.

Some investors noted that dealers have struggled for years to keep up with the ballooning Treasury market and said regulators could do more to free up liquidity after promising to address structural issues in the market.

They said dealers could buy more bonds if the Fed scrapped a rule introduced following the 2008 financial crisis requiring they hold capital against Treasuries. The Fed temporarily suspended that rule in 2020.

""There’s less capital from market makers ready to step in and push yields back toward fair value,"" said Steven Abrahams, senior managing director at Amherst Pierpont Securities.

Some pointed to 20-year Treasuries as an example of how poor liquidity is hurting trading. That tenor has seen little demand since it was reintroduced in 2020. This makes it harder to execute arbitrage trades, for instance swapping exposure to a longer-dated bond with the 20-year one.

Liquidity has declined even more in recent weeks, investors said, citing thin summer trading and renewed uncertainty over how aggressive the Fed will be on rate hikes.

""The lack of certainty about the direction of the Fed ... has just put the liquidity and typical liquidity providers in a holding pattern,"" said John Luke Tyner, fixed income analyst at Aptus Capital Advisors.

The ICE BofA MOVE Index - a measure of expected volatility in U.S. Treasuries - hit 156 in early July, just shy of its 163 peak in March 2020, when pandemic fears gripped investors and liquidity quickly dropped to 2008 crisis levels. That prompted the Fed to buy $1.6 trillion of Treasuries.

Some investors said mounting fears of a recession could convince the Fed to slow or stall quantitative tightening. If it keeps tightening, many see no immediate end to the liquidity problems.

""It just feels like this is going to be the new normal,"" said John Madziyire, a senior portfolio manager at Vanguard.

52e74444-3df4-48a1-a840-12269dcd648b,"Quantitative tightening (QT) reduces the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. It transfers a significant amount of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities to investors.

The current Fed policy is to use QT as a tool to combat inflation as well as increasing interest rates.

It is the opposite of what has been more prevalent over the past several years in Quantitative Easing, whereby central banks print money to purchase securities from the open market.

QT has not been the policy in the US since 2017, and according to macro data, this QT will be more significant when financial markets are strained. The goal is to combat surging inflation by reducing the $9 trillion Fed balance sheet.

In 2019 there was $4.2 trillion on the Fed balance sheet, and by the end of May 2022, it had risen to a staggering $8.9 trillion due to aggressive asset purchases throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.

Between 2017 and 2019, the Fed reduced its bond holding by $650B. We will start to see the impact of QT this September, and data suggests that it will be more extensive and aggressive than in 2017. The Fed will likely be offloading $95B of Treasuries and Mortgage-backed securities, based on projections of more than $2 trillion.

Further, the US Treasury market is also more volatile than in 2017. The blue line in the chart below shows the MOVE index, which measures future volatility in treasury rates. The volatility is well above the levels during the height of Covid-19 and the previous period of QT in 2017.

The green line represents liquidity measures such as the bid-ask spread for Treasury bills. This spread is also elevated, similar to pandemic levels.

The following chart illustrates the maximum share of SOMA-eligible securities held by each investor type since 2000. This data acts as a realized benchmark for the maximum balance sheet absorption capacity. Foreign holders and money market funds (MMFs) may be able to absorb some additional SOMA-eligible securities, though the scope is likely limited. However, pensions and banks are near capacity.

The share of Foreign Holders has been declining since the global financial crisis as they pivoted to purchasing gold instead. The Fed will need much higher yields for short-term maturities, indicating that this QT episode has the potential to be more disruptive than ever before, primarily due to rising rates.

Bitcoin has no such monetary policy. There is no way to increase supply without forking the entire network, removing any party’s ability to increase the Bitcoin money supply. Bitcoin is automated in terms of monetary policy, with supply tied directly to hashrate and network difficulty. These mechanics form part of the argument favoring Bitcoin as a store of value and a long-term inflation hedge.

The crypto industry has followed traditional securities markets throughout 2022. However, Bitcoin has never experienced a recession, aggressive QT, or inflation beyond 2.3%, all of which are prevalent in today’s market. The following 12 months will be unprecedented territory for Bitcoin, and it will be a real test of its economical design.

cb1ce8fd-07ca-4fa3-b6fe-c979f4ac7f0b,"This QT process kicked up a notch this month, and the Fed is now allowing $US60 billion of US government bonds and $US35 billion of mortgage-backed securities to roll off its books each month, without using the proceeds to buy new bonds.

The Fed’s balance sheet shrinkage means $US95 billion is being taken out of the financial system each month.

Falling into a ‘liquidity hole’

In the short term, the main impact of QT is to drive bond yields higher. And rising bond yields, in turn, put pressure on sharemarket valuations.

But some analysts warn that the rapid shrinkage in the Fed’s balance sheet will inevitably trigger a liquidity crunch in financial markets.

The giant hedge fund Bridgewater, for instance, believes that markets are at risk of falling into a “liquidity hole”.

Bridgewater analysts point out that the Fed’s massive bond purchases during the pandemic swamped financial markets with money. What’s more, US banks used some of the reserves the Fed created in this process to buy bonds.

But now the process has been thrown into reverse. “Both are now sellers, and this liquidity shortfall is reverberating across financial assets broadly and hitting the frothiest segments the most,” they argue.

They point out that the combination of the rapidly expanding liquidity hole and the Fed’s aggressive rate rises has created “a double whammy for financial assets”.

One of the reasons analysts are nervous about the Fed’s shrinking balance sheet is that no one is sure when the drying up of liquidity will start to affect markets.

Especially since the Fed is now shrinking its balance sheet at a much faster clip than it has before.

The last time the Fed shrank its balance sheet was in October 2017. At the time, the Fed’s then-chair, Janet Yellen, who is now the US Treasury Secretary, was hopeful that process would be as boring as “watching paint dry”.

And so it proved for about two years, until a shortage of cash pushed overnight borrowing rates sharply higher. The Fed was forced to intervene to provide markets with extra liquidity to stop the spike in overnight lending rates feeding through to higher borrowing costs for businesses and consumers.

But analysts warn that this time, the Fed is likely to be much slower to intervene to soothe market turmoil.

US consumer inflation is running at 8.5 per cent, and Fed policymakers are becoming increasingly anxious that inflationary pressures have become more entrenched.

This means they will be reluctant to ease monetary policy, even if bond yields rise sharply, or if sharemarkets suffer a savage sell-off."

Sonic Healthcare (ASX: SHL)

Matthew Kidman: Let’s get to healthcare. One of the older stocks did quite well, pathology, Sonic Healthcare. Buy, hold, or sell?

Michelle Lopez (HOLD): Sonic is a hold as well. This is a really well-run business, but they’re facing some real headwinds from an earnings projection and trajectories down. The reason for that is the COVID-19 testing. That represents 25 per cent of their revenue still, and it’s a much higher margin than their underlying business. Unfortunately, they can’t make it up, even as well as the company is run, so it’s a hold at these levels.

Matthew Kidman: Great result, David, but bring back the good old days of COVID-19. Buy, hold, or sell?

David Wilson (SELL): I agree with Michelle. It’s a very well run company, but we have it as a sell. We think that the earnings dip that they’re going to take over the next year or two, because of the way the volumes were brought forward through COVID-19 means that the earnings will come under pressure. So for us, a sell.

Pinnacle Investment Management (ASX: PNI)

Matthew Kidman: Okay. Market sell off earlier this year, Pinnacle Investment Management got torched. Great result, bounced back. Buy, hold, or sell?

David Wilson (BUY): For us, it’s a buy. One of the few fund managers that are actually getting inflows. They’ve got a well diversified group of portfolio managers on their team and they continue to getting inflows, both internationally and from retail in Australia. So for us, it’s a buy.

Matthew Kidman: Incredible job. They just seem to pour that money into their managers. Buy, hold, or sell, Michelle?

Michelle Lopez (BUY): Well, it’s a buy for us too. You’re only as good as your last performance. Fortunately, it’s a partial truism in our industry. But for Pinnacle, they’ve got their model to that point that there are different styles, there are different managers so that key risk around the performance of markets can be mitigated. The other thing I’d say is they’ve got a lot of capacity within their current affiliates that they can grow into. We’re starting to see the flows come through. And that distribution platform, it’s really unparalleled in our market, and they can export that offshore. So caveat being very volatile, I think there’s a lot of leverage to beta in the market within that name. But if you can sail through, I think it’s one to buy.

Matthew Kidman: They’re kicking into gear. Okay. We’ve heard the good times. What didn’t do so well that worried you during reporting season?

Michelle Lopez (SELL): Look, I think the disappointment for us was ASX. ASX is one of those really high-quality defensive names, but it disappointed from a cost perspective, both OpEx and CapEx. They’ve got CHESS, which is the blockchain settlement system that they’re trying to roll out. That got delayed again. And they’ve had some key management changes. You’ve had, in a very short space of time, the CEO, CFO, and head of listings all leaving the organisation at an already critical point. So we think just looking forward, there’s a lot of risk factors that haven’t played out yet, so that was the disappointment for us.

Matthew Kidman: David, sounds like even monopolies can have a bad go at it. What was the one that caught your eye that made you walk away?

David Wilson (SELL): I would also say that I agree with Michelle. We actually thought ASX was very disappointing as well, but even more disappointing for us was Coles. They continue to lag Woolworths in terms of market share. They’re lagging behind them in terms of CapEx and the online development of their business. So for us, that was particularly disappointing.

Matthew Kidman: There’s not a stronger word in the English language than disappointing. But luckily, those things were okay during reporting season.

With the United Arab Emirates aiming to be a global crypto hub, Saudi Arabia is looking to have formal regulations for the asset class despite reservations regarding its speculative nature, according to unidentified sources Bloomberg quoted in its report.

AlZahrani reports to Ziad Bander Alyousef, Saudi Central Bank’s deputy governor for development and technology, and together with a team in Riyadh, they are engaging with some of the largest cryptocurrency companies on regulations, Bloomberg reported.

Binance Holdings Ltd. has hired people for Saudi Arabia, as it recognizes potential in the region if current restrictions are relaxed, the report said.

Saudi Arabian regulators had issued a statement in 2018 clarifying that cryptocurrency trading is illegal in the kingdom due to “their negative consequences and high risks on the traders as they are out of government supervision.”

Meanwhile, Emirati state Dubai announced in July its plans to be one of the top 10 cities globally in the metaverse economy, creating 40,000 virtual jobs and adding US$4 billion to the city’s economy in five years.

Already, crypto companies like Binance, FTX, Crypto.com and Bybit have received approvals to set up bases in Dubai.

To listen to some commentators, you would think superannuation was about politics rather than retirement.

What is clear after 30 years of compulsory super is that the majority of Australians have super accounts that will help provide the sort of comfortable and enjoyable retirement their parents could barely dream about.

Yet some with vested interests want to make Australians fear their retirement savings are going to be used irresponsibly. Recently, a range of think-tank philosophers from the extremes of left and right have waged a campaign aimed at making industry super members, in particular, panic about imaginary threats to their retirement balances.

The cast of manufactured vaudeville villains is familiar: so-called financial activists, board members with vested interests, and even a conspiracy aimed at seizing control of capitalism (according to two former Liberal members of parliament, the Russian revolutionary Lenin predicted it.)

It could lead one to think Australia’s retirement income system has failed when the very opposite is true.

According to the most recent Mercer CFA Institute Global Pension Index – the top international index of global retirement savings – Australia’s system is No.6 in the world, behind some of the most socially egalitarian and well-governed nations on earth.

The irrational and emotive arguments used against industry super can be easily dismissed easily with facts. Through their super, Australians own $3.3 trillion in retirement assets, administered with low fees and high levels of probity, guided by strong legislation, regulation and corporate oversight.

This is especially so for industry funds, which exist solely for their members’ benefit. The proof is in the strong, long-term performance of industry funds.

To those who say that super (by which they generally mean industry super and not higher-charging and lower-returns-generating retail funds) is making people poorer, my answer is to remember it was not so long ago when ordinary Australians had little to look forward to in retirement than penny-pinching frugality on the pension.

Perhaps the biggest fallacy peddled by opponents of super is that the funds want to take people’s retirement savings and invest it in their pet projects or other things governments should be funding.

The fact is, no one responsible for managing super funds is arguing that funds be used for anything other than maximising returns for members. In fact, they are bound by law to do so.

Yes, funds are examining new areas for investment that these critics object to, for example renewable energy projects; emerging high-tech manufacturing; medical research and affordable housing. Why wouldn’t they?

These sectors of the economy are where millions of Australians gain employment and profit. They are the modern economy. If funds invest in them, it is because they offer sound investments that promise favourable returns. It is that simple. There is no conspiracy involved.

There is a great opportunity for funds like Cbus Super to be investing in our modern economy. In the last financial year, the fund made a number of significant investments with long-term returns in mind, in opportunities and businesses with strong sustainable growth. As the world continues to evolve, we’ll evolve with it.

With regard to social and affordable housing, Cbus’ investment in bonds issued by the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation demonstrates what can be achieved by government, super and industry working together.

When you think about it, asking funds not to invest in asset classes such as these is the best way to ensure they break their duty to provide members with the highest possible returns.

Some opponents of industry super funds have suggested we are making sizeable political donations, which they refuse to reveal. As Chair of Cbus, I can emphatically state that we make $0 in political donations.

That has long been the policy of the Cbus Board and one we all strongly endorse. It’s important to understand that the anti-superannuation position is based on ideology that is opposed to compulsory savings and the equal representative trustee model of industry super.

Let’s be clear: these arguments have nothing to do with giving Australians a decent retirement, or ensuring investment goes to where it will generate the best result for fund members, their country and future generations.

Just as employee and employer representatives worked together for the benefit of the nation at the recent Jobs Summit, so too do industry super funds operate in a bipartisan way that allows the system to deliver a better life for everyday people and a better future for the whole country. The arguments from these critics are all about politics. Full stop.

16601fa7-5916-4091-9ccd-3b21ba2e4cb8,"Access to superannuation is one of the questions I’m most frequently asked about, as our population ages and the rules keep changing. It’s fairly simple, but it helps to understand a few of the basic principles.

The federal government wants you to leave your super untouched for as long as possible, so has enacted laws to prevent you from withdrawing it before you retire. This harnesses the power of compounding for your benefit and ensures you do not fritter away your retirement savings during your working life.

Most money in super is a “preserved benefit”; that means it cannot be touched until you satisfy two conditions to access it: reaching your preservation age and stopping work.

The preservation age is slowly being increased so that, by 2025, all super benefits will be held until age 60, for anyone born after June 1964."
51d5d3d2-8e38-43a5-a93e-a6ba99442855,"Superannuation has been the place to be over the past five years – the top performing balanced funds (60 to 76 per cent growth assets) returned as much as 7.76 per cent – the latest figures from SuperRatings show.

The top 10 funds over five years included seven industry funds, a corporate fund (Qantas) and two retail for-profit funds. The lowest performer in the top 10 recorded 6.54 per cent.

The SuperRatings chart, above, shows the dramatic difference time can make to super returns. Over three years, top 10 returns ranged between 6.72 and 5.04 per cent, while over the year to June 2022 returns ranged from +1.57 per cent to –1.87 per cent.

The low returns or losses for the 12 months to June 2022 were driven by falling share markets and rising interest rates.

Average is good

Even if you were not invested in one of the top 10 funds over the last five years you are probably doing OK. That is because the average balanced fund returned 6 per cent over five years and 8.1 per cent over 10 years.

But the world has changed in recent times with the return of inflation, rising interest rates and sharp volatility in equity markets.

Also, the superannuation world is consolidating at a dramatic rate.

There will be eight super funds with more than $125 billion in assets by mid-2025, consultancy KPMG stated. That means your fund may have merged with another fund that you don’t know.

So far, mergers have been positive for fund members. “With mergers we’ve seen to date there has usually been a pretty material sort of benefit – a cut in 10- to 20-basis points in administration fees,” Kirby Rappell, director of SuperRatings, said.

In other words, funds become cheaper to run. As the chart, below, from KPMG illustrates there are large variations between the costs of different funds.

The high cost ones tend to be smaller boutique funds looking after small coteries of workers. The chart, below, is from June 2021, so some fund costs may have improved since then.

Mergers where small funds are swallowed by industry behemoths generally deliver better returns and “it’s been a pretty clear comparison [between pre- and post-merger returns],” Mr Rappell said.

As the fund market becomes more concentrated that will change. “You now have a smaller cohort of funds, but there will still be more mergers going forward,” Mr Rappell said.

With many mergers already capturing the low hanging fruit, further concentration of already big funds won’t necessarily deliver benefits to members, Mr Rappell said.

That means it will be worth your while to check the performance of any fund that merges with yours to help decide whether you are best served to stay with the merged entity.

Rising interest rates

Rising rates are changing the investment world by making equity markets more volatile and providing better yields for products that aren’t share based. Super funds are reacting to that with investment decisions.

“We see funds are reacting to that by going back into the fixed interest a bit more, also they’re going into listed property,” Mr Rappell said.

You can act yourself

For super fund members who have felt they were exposed to equities to a greater degree than they were comfortable with because returns elsewhere were negligible, things are starting to change.

That creates new options but you need to be careful. “If you have a long-term position in equities through super or elsewhere you don’t want to change that now because you are locking in losses,” said Dr Angel Zhong, senior lecturer in finance at RMIT University.

Those losses would come because share markets have fallen this calendar year and moving your super into a more conservative option would mean crystallising those lower market prices.

However, that is not the end of the story. “If you are putting any money into super beyond your compulsory contribution you don’t have to put all that extra money into your balanced option,” Dr Zhong said.

“You can actually spread that money across different options.” That could mean choosing another asset allocation in your super fund – something like fixed interest, cash, property or infrastructure.

Or if you have the knowledge and confidence “you could diversify into other asset classes such as shares, ETFs [exchange traded funds] or cryptocurrencies,” Dr Zhong said.

Alternatively, if you are coming up to retirement you may want to put extra money into conservative super options to give yourself a cash or near cash option to cover unexpected costs or pay for a year or two’s retirement income.

However, you can be too conservative in retirement planning.

“You should put aside enough to cover off the next three year’s worth of income needs without having to sell down assets,” said Rob Goudie, principal with Consortium Private Wealth.

Beware a rising cost of living in your retirement years. “A couple retiring in their 60s can expect at least one to live into their 90s,” Mr Goudie said.

“If you get too conservative your money will go backwards with inflation factored in and you risk running out of money late in your retirement.”

44c32505-2477-48ff-9106-d81af6f3b8da,"Australia’s superannuation industry enters its fourth decade under the darkening clouds of a global economic slowdown that is already having a dramatic impact on returns.

At the same time, the industry is celebrating the achievements of its first 30 years.

First and foremost, some 15.6 million Australian workers now have superannuation with a collective savings pool of A$3.4tn (€2.3trn). In 1992 when the first superannuation scheme was launched, just four of every 10 working Australians had superannuation accounts.

Australia’s compulsory superannuation guarantee system has delivered an “enormous social contribution” and helped move the population towards the goal of having a decent retirement and weaning people off the age pension, says Mark Delaney, chief investment officer with AustralianSuper.

Reminiscing about the early days, Delaney told participants at the 2022 Superannuation Investment conference that funds had between A$300m and A$500m in member savings 30 years ago. Most of that was invested in capital-guarantee products. “What we should have done was to buy a lot of stocks and keep them,” he says.

These days Delaney has oversight of what is now a A$261bn Australian super behemoth which runs a huge team of investment professionals, and offices in London and New York.

One constant goal, he says, is never to lose sight of the fact that super funds manage money for their members. Sticking to that basic principle provides a strong anchor, he says.

Delaney also touches on another characteristic of the industry – working collectively through the likes of IFM Investors, a global fund manager, and ISPT, an Australian property asset manager.

He says industry funds have to work hard to maintain cohesiveness, determining what they have in common rather than focusing on their differences.

The biggest issue today is that the super industry is huge, says Delaney. “Going back 30 years it was tiny and pretty much irrelevant to capital markets.” He adds that industry super is now well-placed to make a big contribution to the country.

Sam Sicilia, Hostplus chief investment officer, says super savings have gone into funding start-up companies to keep them in Australia rather than force them to go overseas in search of capital.

“Super savings are helping to rotate Australia’s economy into the future and out of its historical focus on resources – coal and iron ore,” he says. Australia is still a big commodity exporter, he observes, but it is an economy that is evolving as the country looks through the centuries ahead.

Few have been able to fault the performance of Australia’s superannuation system when it comes to its investment choices and stellar returns – until this year (see figure).

Now there has been a reversal of fortune for the country’s best-performing super funds.

Delaney told AustralianSuper’s 2.3 million members recently that its negative return reflected challenging global pressures and interest rates over the last six months,

He shares prevailing sentiment among his peers that this particular global downturn could last three or four years. Compared with what is in store for super funds, he says the global financial crisis and other earlier events were mere “blips” because returns recovered after a short downturn.

Performance is one thing, but the industry faces other challenges in the next 10 years.

John Piggott, professor and director of the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence in Population Ageing Research at the University of New South Wales, says that, overall, the design of the Australian super system is “sensible and sustainable” but it needs improvement.

He says Australia can do better in taxation and in regard to members’ fees. The latter, however, is slowly resolving itself with increased scheme consolidation. The larger funds have already started to reduce their fees.

Piggott says members should be able to access better-quality financial advice as they move into the retirement phase.

Retirement income

The challenge to confront them increasingly will be the issue of retirement income. He describes this as “an important and big challenge”.

Ian Fryer, general manager of Chant West, an Australian research, data and analytics provider, says: “By and large the system has done well at accumulating capital, but it hasn’t done a good job at providing products that are helpful when people want to take their money out.

Show Fullscreen

“Currently, almost everyone has what is called an account-based pension, which means that they just draw down as much as they like. There is no protection, in particular against longevity and market downturns.”

Fryer says Australia’s newly implemented Retirement Income Covenant regulation requires each super fund to come up with a retirement income strategy. Over the next few years, he says, the industry is expected to develop retirement income products.

Fryer tells IPE that a lot more work has to be done in this space to deliver a wider range of products, including advice for those in retirement.

Going into the new decade, funds will have to grapple with investment approaches as they implement their ESG policies, which could influence their returns.

Piggott says responsible investment and development of the right types of retirement income products are two key concerns. But the industry has not reached a resolution or consensus on either of those issues. Superannuation funds are “feeling their way”.

He says ESG issues remain a challenge. Super funds are becoming involved in impact investing such as social housing, but that funds are still learning in this space.

Fryer says Australian funds will increase their foreign investments.

The larger funds realise they are swamping the local market and have long diversified into the offshore market, he says and, so far, they have done well, moving from being “consumers of products” to a role as genuine equal partners in owning large assets overseas.

“There is a natural hedge. The Australian dollar tends to be weaker at a time when global markets are weaker.”

The next step will be establishing on-the-ground investment teams abroad."

SINGAPORE/HONG KONG (Reuters) -Georgia's former prime minister Bidzina Ivanishvili alleged on Monday a trust unit of Credit Suisse had failed to take steps to prevent him from losing $1.27 billion, as a Singapore court started to hear evidence in the case.

Ivanishvili has accused Credit Suisse Trust Ltd in Singapore of failing to safeguard his investments and ""take the appropriate steps"" to prevent losses linked to fraud committed by its former Geneva-based banker Patrice Lescaudron.

The trust unit said in its opening statement ""the quantum of damages claimed by the plaintiffs is extreme,"" without mentioning the amount. It asked the court to dismiss the claim.

Ivanishvili gave evidence to the Singapore International Commercial Court via a video link from Georgia. An opening statement from his lawyers said the trustee had calculated his losses at $818.2 million, below their estimate of $1.27 billion.

The case comes as Credit Suisse's new CEO Ulrich Koerner, promoted just over a month ago, aims to put the bank back on an even keel after a string of scandals.

Koerner has been tasked with paring back investment banking and cutting more than $1 billion in costs to help Switzerland's second-biggest bank recover from the setbacks and losses.

In a statement read to the court, Ivanishvili's barrister Cavinder Bull SC said $1.1 billion had been placed under the custodianship of the Credit Suisse Trust in 2005.

Lescaudron was Credit Suisse's ""conduit"" for Ivanishvili's business and started ""fraudulently mismanaging"" the trust's investments and ""misappropriating"" the trust funds as early as 2007, the statement said.

Lescaudron was convicted by a Swiss court in 2018 of forging the signatures of former clients, including Ivanishvili, over an eight year period. He admitted falsifying trades and hiding losses as part of a scheme that made him tens of millions of Swiss francs.

Lescaudron subsequently took his own life, court documents said.

'DUTY TO PROTECT'

Credit Suisse is reeling from billions in losses racked up in 2021 via failed investments, plus the impact of multiple legal cases, including a Bermuda court case, also involving Ivanishvili, that could cost around $600 million.

The Swiss bank has said its life insurance subsidiary, which is involved in the Bermuda court case and is in the process of being wound down, intended to ""vigorously pursue"" an appeal of a ruling from that court that it should pay out damages.

In its opening statement in the Singapore court, the trust unit said the proceedings against it were ""overreaching"".

Credit Suisse Trust accepted it was ""under a duty to protect the Trust Assets if it had actual knowledge that those assets were not being managed properly,"" it said, adding that - at that time - it did not have such knowledge.

""CS Trust invites the Court to dismiss the claim as being against the wrong defendant and on the wrong basis,"" it said.

Ivanishvili's lawyers, however, said submissions made at trial would ""demonstrate that the Plaintiffs should be granted the reliefs that they seek"".

""I thought I came to the experts who will be working to protect my capital and my family,"" Ivanishvili told the court via a translator.

The hearing before Justice Patricia Bergin continues on Tuesday.

af347617-5ec3-42d8-8a42-fec66ec19c57,"“Binary options are harmful, high-risk financial products resulting in millions of dollars in losses for retail investors before our ban,” said ASIC deputy chairwoman Karen Chester. “Extending our binary options ban until 2031 ensures this important protection for retail investors will continue.”

Data collated by the regulator suggested net losses were about $490 million in 2018, before ASIC issued a warning about the product in 2019. Net losses then fell to about $6.7 million in 2019, before doubling between April 2020 and May last year before the temporary ban. The product intervention order resulted in net losses plummeting to zero in the year to May this year.

‘Effective in reducing risk’

“As a result of the prohibition, there were no losses [or profits] for any retail client from trading binary options after the effective date,” ASIC reported in July. “Based on our analysis, we consider that the binary options order has been effective in reducing the risk of significant detriment to retail clients resulting from binary options and so should remain in force.”

Consumer group CHOICE warned during the consultation that binary options “share many characteristics with high-risk gambling products and regularly result in large losses to consumers”.

The ban was not opposed by the Australian CFD and Margin FX Association, which said none of its members offered binary options and did not make a submission during the latest consultation. The lobbyist agreed binary options were “akin to gambling” and was “fully supportive” of the ban.

ASIC said the ban’s extension brought Australia into line with global peers. Binary options were banned for retail investors in Britain in 2018, with the country’s Gambling Commission taking over surveillance of the market from the Financial Conduct Authority.

At least 28 other foreign jurisdictions have prohibited or restricted trade in binary options, including the European Union.

‘Financial heroin hit’

ASIC in April also moved to extend its product intervention order placing limits on the trade of contracts for difference (CFD) until May 2027. CFDs are another key product line in the multitrillion-dollar over-the-counter derivatives market.

They allow investors to bet on whether a certain underlying asset (such as company stock, a market index, currency or commodity) will rise or fall. Gains and losses are often maximised by leverage (debt taken on to expand the size of an initial investment). The feature has been described as providing a “financial heroin hit” by consumer groups.

Under the restrictions introduced in March last year, the amount of leverage that can be attached to CFD trades was limited and certain inducements to engage in risky trading were prohibited.

It is understood that concerns about derivatives trading was among the factors leading to ASIC’s warning last week that investment platforms and so-called neo-brokers avoid adding harmful new features.

The regulator said trading platforms were adding trading in risky products such as CFDs and cryptocurrency assets to offset a decline in equities trading volumes during the sharemarket downturn.

Andrew Forrest’s Wyloo lent $150 million to Hastings Technology Metals in late August.

Hastings was yet to put the pricing to investors at market open, but sources expected the raise to be structured as a two-tranche placement and launch later on Monday.

Receivers FTI Consulting said they considered binding offers’ deal structure and conditions precedent in taking their pick.

“We are now moving to final documentation which includes agreeing key operating agreements with stakeholders of Basslink and which will also include a deed of company arrangement to effect the restructuring being proposed to creditors for approval,” FTI Consulting’s Vaughan Strawbridge said in a statement.

It’s the outcome APA Group needed, but one that it had to fight for much harder than expected.

Macquarie Capital-advised APA owned the debt and enforcement rights and was arguably the natural owner, given its position in Australia’s energy market and ambition to step up in the electricity sector to help drive and fund the transition to renewable sources.

It picked up the secured debt in February, a few months after Basslink went into administration, and appointed FTI as receiver soon after. FTI ran a sale, and hired Houlihan Lokey to help with the auction.

APA’s recent financial results revealed it had spent $587.4 million on acquisitions and investments (Basslink) in the year to June 30."

But Goldman Sachs has since switched to the in-play David Jones, as Street Talk first reported early last month, where it is working for the department store’s owner Woolworths of South Africa.

Whatever happens at David Jones is likely to be highly material for its arch-rival Myer.

If a private equity firm snaps up David Jones, there’s a chance it may be interested in adding Myer. If it’s a strategic suitor, which seems less likely, then you can bet the suitor would also be thinking about Myer.

Either way, both Myer and David Jones have at various stages in the past realised there could be significant synergies in combining the flagship retailers, and would want to be on top of all of its options again now that the sector is in play.

When Myer proposed a $3 billion share-based “merger of equals” with David Jones in October 2013, it was pitched as a way to create a department store powerhouse with sales of $5 billion, more than 100 stores across two separate brands, and much-needed clout to negotiate better deals with landlords and suppliers.

Myer’s near-term and not necessarily unrelated issue is Solomon Lew and his Premier Investments, which increased its stake to 23 per cent of the company’s shares on issue last month.

Premier Investments paired its buying with a fresh call for board representation, requesting that one of its own join Myer’s board at the annual general meeting in November. It nominated Terrence McCartney, a former Coles Myer operative, who is also a Premier non-executive director.

It comes as investors take a fresh look at Myer, which analysts expect to record about $2.9 billion revenue and $423 million EBITDA in the 2022 financial year, knowing that there could be change on the horizon.

The activity has sent Myer shares up 9 per cent in the past month, including a 6.9 per cent jump on Monday.

Dicker Data distributes IT hardware and software, selling brands including Cisco, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Microsoft. It had a $1.99 billion market capitalisation prior to the raising.

The raising comes as investors await Dicker Data’s half-year results, which were due on Tuesday.

Sunac China is among a number of Chinese developers in Hong King, including China Evergrande Group, who have received similar petitions, with the region reeling under a wave of defaults in the debt-laden property market.

The petition was made by Chen Huaijun, the holder of the notes, and a hearing will be held on Nov. 16, the judiciary's website showed a day earlier.

The petition ""did not represent the interests of other stakeholders and may impair the value of the company,"" and it seeks to ""resolutely oppose"" it, Sunac China said in a statement filed to the Hong Kong bourse.

Sunac China further assured investors it has made ""considerable progress"" on discussions with creditors regarding its offshore debt restructuring after missing some bond payments earlier this year.

56348a41-89d7-416d-8b2d-d8c719eca480,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's High Court approved on Monday an application by China Evergrande Group and its major offshore credit group to adjourn a winding-up petition against it to Nov. 7.

An investor in Evergrande's unit online real estate and automobile marketplace, Fangchebao (FCB), filed the petition in Hong Kong in June because the developer had not honoured an agreement worth $110 million to repurchase shares the investor bought in FCB.

It is the first winding-up petition known to have been filed against Evergrande, which is reeling under more than $300 billion in liabilities.

If the petition is successful, it could affect Evergrande's debt restructuring plan by diminishing the value of its overseas assets that are central to the interests of offshore creditors.

In Monday's hearing, judge Peter Ng said an immediate liquidation requested by the practitioner would derail Evergrande's efforts to formulate a restructuring for all the offshore creditors.

He said that the right of other creditors should also be respected if they have a higher chance of recovery under a restructuring plan, as an ad hoc group of Evergrande's offshore creditors, which holds $3 billion of the firm's debt, also opposed the winding-up petition.

Ng said the speed of Evergrande's restructuring was unsatisfactory, but he acknowledged the complexity and sheer size of the firm's debt and he expected meaningful progress in restructuring by the next hearing.

In a filing on Monday following the court adjournment, Evergrande said it is actively pushing forward the offshore debt restructuring work with its financial and legal advisers and aims to announce a concrete resolution plan that respects the rights of all stakeholders as soon as possible.

Evergrande missed a self-imposed deadline to provide a detailed restructuring proposal by end-July. It said in an update in July that the due diligence process was continuing, and expected the work to be completed in the near future, with an aim to announce a specific plan in 2022.

A person familiar with the restructuring plan told Reuters separately Evergrande's goal was to present by November a restructuring plan with more details and which would have key creditors' approval

The developer's entire $22.7 billion worth of offshore debt including loans and private bonds is deemed to be in default after missing payment obligations late last year, and it began talks with offshore creditors about the restructuring proposal earlier this year.

The company had said in a June filing that it would ""vigorously"" oppose the winding-up lawsuit and that the petition would not impact its restructuring plan.

The rate of ABSTUDY and JobSeeker for singles without children will rise by $25.70 a fortnight, while payment for single parent carers will increase by $35.20.

Minister for Social Services Amanda Rishworth said the Albanese government wanted to ensure ""a strong social security safety net to protect our most disadvantaged” as cost of living pressures intensify.

“Our guiding principles as a Government are ensuring no one is left behind and no one is held back and this indexation increase will help those on Government payments keep up with the cost of living,"" Minister Rishworth said.

The boost, as part of the six-monthly standard indexation, comes as inflation is set to hit 7.75 per cent in the December quarter.

The Reserve Bank is expected to lift the cash rate 2.35 per cent with further rate hikes flagged in the coming months.

Amid soaring inflation, petrol prices are set to skyrocket by the end of the month when the 44.2 cent fuel excise is reinstated.

The excise, which was halved to 22.1 cents a litre in the March budget, will be reintroduced on September 29.

Treasurer Jim Chalmers has instructed the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to intensify fuel price monitoring to ensure petrol companies do not take advantage of consumers when the fuel excise expires.

""Refiners, importers, wholesalers and retailers should consider themselves on notice – the ACCC is keeping a very close eye on fuel prices across the country to make sure any increases are justifiable,” Dr Chalmers said in a statement on Monday.

“There should be no doubt that if there is evidence of misleading or anti-competitive conduct by fuel retailers, the ACCC will take action.”"

While millions will soon receive a boost in their welfare payments, those hoping the government would act on two major measures have been left disappointed.

From September 20, aged pensioners, disability support pensioners and people on a carer payment can expect a boost in their payment of $38.90 a fortnight for singles and $58.80 a fortnight for couples.

The boost – of almost 4 per cent – is the largest for allowances and pensions in 30 years and 12 years respectively.

The increase is part of the six-monthly recalibration to keep up with changes to the consumer price index, which has soared to an eye-watering 6.1 per cent in the year to the June quarter.

Allowances, including JobSeeker, parenting payment, ABSTUDY and rent assistance will also be increased.

The indexation comes after the federal government last week announced age pensioners could earn an extra $4000 this financial year without losing any payment.

Senator Lambie welcomed the indexation but told Sky News the government must do more to support people struggling with rising mortgage repayments, rent, energy and food costs.

“To chuck this extra $15 or $20 on them a week is just incredible, so if I was them, I’d be giving (people) a lot more slack. We’re also going into the Christmas period,” Senator Lambie told Sky News.

The 44 cent excise tax on fuel was halved in a pre-election sweetener by the former Morrison government back in March.

With petrol prices expected to soar at the end of the month, Treasurer Jim Chalmers has asked the consumer watchdog to intensify monitoring of fuel prices.

The Prime Minister defended the “difficult decision” to scrap the cut, citing budgetary pressures.

“That was something that was a bipartisan decision before the election. We have to make decisions based upon what we can afford,” Mr Albanese said.

But Senator Lambie is not convinced the government’s argument passes the pub test, given its support for the monster stage 3 tax cuts.

“You might want to get your priorities right. But, right now, those people that are sitting on or below the poverty line are really feeling the heat,” Senator Lambie added.

Meanwhile, the Australian Council of Social Services has accused the government of turning its back on JobSeeker recipients after it refused to back a permanent increase to the welfare payment.

“We know that people are just absolutely struggling. They’re at crisis point at the moment. We need to be able to bring people up to be able to live in dignity, to be able to afford the basics. And we need to do it urgently,” she said.

“We know we’ve got women living in cars, people already skipping meals, giving up healthy food. They can’t afford fruit and vegetables and meat – they’re skipping medicine or having to make it go for longer so they don’t have to pay for it as frequently as it’s being prescribed to them.”"

The rate for partnered JobSeeker Payment and Parenting Payment recipients will increase $23.40 a fortnight to $616.60.

The pension raise was driven by increases in the Consumer Price Index which exceeded the increase in the Pensioner and Beneficiary Living Cost Index.

But the fuel excise will return to its normal level after being halved for six months, seeing the price of petrol increased by 25 cents a litre, the AFR continues. Treasurer Jim Chalmers has asked the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to keep a very close eye on petrol prices though to discourage price gouging.

It comes as the Reserve Bank will probably lift our cash rate to 2.35% — it’s a full 200 points higher than the election, the paper points out. Yikes. Mortgage holders will be biting their nails — but it may be the last of its kind for a while, an economist told The New Daily, as the central bank could just watch how the market responds for a while. The Greens have called for an interest rate freeze, but another economist told Guardian Australia it could make prices at the supermarket even higher while hurting savers and renters — the whole idea of raising interest rates is to curb inflation by encouraging us to save more and spend less. Things are tough out there though — the national rental vacancy rate is at a record low of 0.9%, the SMH reports, and many Aussies are struggling to find a place as strong demand and scant rentals are seeing competition (and price!) surge.

The Coalition has never been more unpopular, The Australian ($) says. The latest Newspoll shows support for the Liberal and National parties is at a historic low of 31%, down five points since the May election. The last time numbers like this were seen was after the crazy-successful Kevin07 campaign saw Kevin Rudd become PM. It’s increasingly seeming like a matter of when, not if, the opposition will dump leader Peter Dutton — he is extremely unpopular according to The Australian’s poll, holding just 22% of the vote as preferred PM. Conversely, folks are pretty happy with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese so far — his high approval rating is 61%, the paper says. Newspoll spoke to 1505 voters.

Meanwhile, the NSW Coalition has accused the Albanese government of attempting to influence the Fair Work Commission after Transport Minister David Elliott claimed a letter Employment and Workplace Relations Minister Tony Burke sent to the tribunal could be “improper influence” and may have breached the Fair Work Act. The SMH reports that the Libs say the letter, which flagged a reform that would limit an employer’s ability to tear up enterprise agreements, “sent a clear message” to the unions to keep up the strikes. Hmm. It comes as the future of Australian work will be the top of the agenda this sitting week. Burke will start chatting to business groups and unions about multi-employer bargaining (unions negotiating for workers across several employers at once), ABC reports. The opposition has flat out rejected the concept, saying it gives the unions too much power and could lead to industry-wide strikes. But Treasurer Jim Chalmers waved that away, retorting that it’ll give us much-needed wage growth.

BACK TO WORK

The hotly anticipated climate change bill will finally hit the Senate for debate (you might recall it already passed the lower house). Already key crossbencher David Pocock has slammed the bill for lacking scientific credibility, the Brisbane Times reports, but says the low target is better than nothing. The Greens say it will support the 43% target (and the government needs ’em to get it across the line) but the party says it’ll bring climate trigger legislation to the table too. Basically the trigger would compel Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek to reject any new coal and gas projects that emit more than 100,000 tonnes of carbon. It might sound heavy-handed but it must be pointed out that the Greens are being consistent with the consensus of the world’s best and brightest climate brains in the IPCC report, as The Guardian reports.

Hey, speaking of Plibersek, she’s been urged to save the Gouldian finches from an NT defence development, Guardian Australia reports. The gorgeous rainbow-coloured bird has been spotted in bushland marked for clearing. Conservationists say the species “against the odds, is clawing its way back from the brink” of extinction. But it’s not just our avian friends at risk from climate change. Nurses, midwives, psychologists, the Australian Medical Association and the Royal Australasian College of Physicians (RACP) have released an urgent letter this morning saying climate change-related deaths (like from heat and flooding) are heaping more pressure on top of the already strangled health system in Australia, The Standard reports. More than 40 organisations say they’re seeing the fatalities play out in real time and urged the federal government to act.

ON A LIGHTER NOTE

“Science is cool this way,” a neuroscientist told Helen Santoro recently. “Surprises often mean cool discoveries.” In this case, Santoro made speaking, reading and writing her professional passions, even though the relevant chunk of her brain is missing, as she writes for The New York Times. It’s the left side, right above the ear — the temporal lobe, considered “the centre of language production and comprehension”. When Santoro was born, her parents were told she’d never speak and would require around-the-clock care. But Santoro blew science away — her development was typical, and she went on to excel in academics and sport at school. Scientists were mystified — they ran tests on her for years, searching for abnormalities while Santoro dozed off to the melodic whirls in the scanner. At 15, a neurologist named Ruth Nass told her she couldn’t be in their studies anymore — her brain was just too different from others without temporal lobes. Eh, she said. Santoro was a teenager — she was preoccupied with way more important stuff, like crushes and cross-country training.

Two years later, Santoro’s curiosity started to grow. Why was she so unaffected by her hole in the head? She wrote to Nass, asking whether she’d consider taking her as an intern. Nass agreed, though perhaps somewhat begrudgingly. “You were the worst participant because you were perfectly fine!” Nass told her. “You threw off all of my data.” Years later, Santoro’s interest evolved into a degree in neuroscience. She still takes place in research projects, but it wasn’t until she read an article about another woman just like her — perfectly average, apart from the fact that she was missing her whole temporal lobe — that Santoro felt finally seen. Some boffins now suggest language is not confined to one area of the brain as we thought — rather woven like fine thread throughout the entire thing. Others say it shows just how flexible our brains can be — even if we are missing crucial brain regions on our biological maps, sometimes we just reroute ourselves and get on with it.

Hope this serves as a reminder that you, too, can go another way if you need to.

SAY WHAT?

Climate change is already killing Australians. Fiona Armstrong

The Climate and Health Alliance founder heads up one of more than 40 health and medical organisations urging the Albanese government to take swift action to reduce heat and flooding deaths. The open letter lays out grim statistics — 478 people likely indirectly died as a result of Black Summer’s bushfires, and 23 died in the floods this year. More than 3000 died between 1991 and 2018 because of climate-change-worsened heat.

THE COMMENTARIAT

Damning review dumped on footy finals Saturday — Damon Johnston (The Australian) ($): “The IGEM report, which the Andrews government has been sitting on for at least three weeks, is one of the most significant reviews of frontline emergency services conducted in years. All governments ‘take out the trash’ at a time — usually a Friday afternoon — calculated to offer the best chance of limiting fallout from a political problem. It’s a cynical but effective strategy. But the decision to release such an important review on a Saturday takes this disgraceful tactic to new depths. Compounding the disgrace was the absence of the premier from its release. Instead, Emergency Services Minister Jaclyn Symes was pushed out the front door to face the heat.

“Mr Andrews often sells himself as being above political games. But Saturday’s appalling episode was political gamesmanship of the worst kind. One of the most important jobs of any state government is to ensure high standard emergency health services, but the Andrews government has failed Victorians on this front. When confronted with the evidence of its own failure, it’s now clear the government’s first instinct wasn’t to brief the public on what went wrong and how they would fix it. No, this government was focused on saving its own skin by dumping the report on a Saturday, a day when many Victorians were only interested in one event: Geelong v Collingwood at the MCG.”

Under Liz Truss, we’ll be careering into petrolhead politics while the world burns — John Harris (The Guardian): “What a strange, heady, anxious summer that was. For all the talk by many journalists and politicians about the cost of living crisis as something that will decisively arrive in the autumn, it is already here. At the same time, the landscape of this small corner of northern Europe is parched and straw-coloured, while those terrifying images of flooding in Pakistan have illustrated the climate emergency’s even more nightmarish flipside. The pandemic, it turns out, was merely one more crisis on the way to something completely convulsive: payback for our fragile dependence on fossil fuels, and a way of living that is no longer sustainable. With perfect timing, next weekend will see the return to London’s streets of Extinction Rebellion, whose protests will trigger the usual sneers from climate deniers while hammering home 2022’s awful sense of urgency.

“Meanwhile, as if the immediate future is being decided by a TV scriptwriter who specialises in the bleakest comedy, Liz Truss is seemingly about to move into Downing Street after two months of surreal and largely pointless debate in which the climate crisis has barely figured. She and Rishi Sunak may have paid lip service to the government’s nominal target of achieving net zero by 2050 — but whatever their other differences, they have largely spoken with one voice on climate policy: the cursory, slightly bored tone of people who think of it as an optional extra.”

Low-income earners and pensioners in South Australia were recently given some financial relief when the state government delivered on a budget commitment related to Centrelink.

The one-off, doubled cost of living concession payment was aimed at providing relief for about 192,000 people who received up to $449 in cash directly into their bank accounts.

SA Premier Peter Malinauskas said it was the largest ever state government payment to concession card holders and low-income earners.

Low-income earners and pensioners in South Australia were recently given some financial relief when the state government delivered on a budget commitment related to Centrelink

Under the concession scheme, home owner-occupiers received $449, while renters got $224.60 per household.

Homeowner-occupiers who are self-funded retirees with a commonwealth seniors health card also received $224.60 per household.

While the payment was welcome, Mission Australia chief executive Sharon Callister told NCA NewsWire that everyone on income support lost when payments were kept below the poverty line.

'Right across the country, people are skipping meals, are socially isolated, are unable to afford to heat or cool their homes or are being forced into homelessness because they can't pay rent,' she said.

'A one-off payment might ease the pain in the short-term, but it does nothing to address the long-term issues.'

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is pictured before speaking at the end of the Jobs and Skills Summit at Parliament House in Canberra, Friday, September 2, 2022

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was vague when discussing JobSeeker during the week after minister Amanda Rishworth said there would be no lift to JobSeeker in the October budget.

'We´ll examine JobSeeker and examine other payments each and every year, which is what you´d expect Labor governments to do,' Mr Albanese told ABC radio in Sydney.

'The last time we were in office, we had the largest ever increase in pensions in Australian history.'

Ms Callister said Australia´s income support safety net must be adequate to protect people from poverty and properly support people to seek work if they are able to do so.

'The JobSeeker rate remains severely inadequate at $46 a day and can actually prevent people from getting back into work,' she said.

'No one can survive let alone thrive and get back into work if they can´t pay for transport to interviews, appropriate clothing or a stable housing situation.

'The federal government´s refusal to increase JobSeeker is condemning people to live in poverty and pushes people into homelessness.

'Income support must be urgently increased as the cost of living pressures escalate and the housing crisis worsens.'

The one-off, doubled cost of living concession payment was aimed at providing relief for about 192,000 people who received up to $449 in cash directly into their bank accounts (pictured Centrelink queues)

Similarly, Mr Albanese is facing pressure to bring forward his cheaper childcare policy, which could save families up to $11,000 per year.

The federal government will increase childcare subsidy rates for every family earning less than $530,000 - at a cost of $5.4bn over four years - but it will not begin until July 2023.

The government is facing calls to bring it forward to January, but Mr Albanese has so far refused to budge.

Ms Callister said Mission Australia was a member of the Thrive by Five campaign, which was a Minderoo Foundation initiative.

'(We support) efforts to improve the accessibility, affordability and quality of early education opportunities for young children,' she said.

According to the campaign´s website, the cost of childcare has risen faster than the cost of housing or electricity.

'A family with two kids in childcare can shell out $25,000 a year in childcare costs,' it said.

'Families who wish to work more than three days a week are discouraged because the costs are higher than wages earned.'"

Low-income earners and concession card holders will be able to access the one-off payment through their Centrelink accounts

The cost of living concession replaced the council rate concession to help people on low or fixed incomes with their general living expenses such as council rates, energy and medical bills.

All existing and eligible new customers who applied by July 1 should receive their payment by the end of this month.

New applicants have until the end of this year to apply for the payments.

To obtain the concession, you must live at a property and receive a Centrelink payment, hold an eligible card or meet low income provisions.

Tenants must not be living with anyone who earns more than the low income provisions, unless they either get an allowance from Centrelink or the Department of Veterans´ Affairs, or are your spouse, domestic partner or dependant.

To apply, you will need your Centrelink customer reference number, DVA file number or a copy of your most recent tax assessment."

Social Services Minister Amanda Rishworth says an indexation increase to welfare payments to begin on September 20 will be the largest for allowances in more than 30 years, and 12 years for pensions.

“We want to ensure Australia has a strong social security safety net to protect our most disadvantaged,” she said on Monday.

“Our guiding principles as a government are ensuring no one is left behind and no one is held back ... This indexation increase will help those on government payments keep up with the cost of living.”

Age Pension, Disability Support Pension and Carer Payment will all rise $38.90 a fortnight for singles and $58.80 a fortnight for couples.

The maximum rate of pension will increase to $1026.50 a fortnight for singles and $773.80 for each member of a pensioner couple or $1547.60 per couple.

Labor minister Clare O’Neil said a review of the JobSeeker payment would take place in May next year, defending her government against criticism the increases aren’t high enough.

“Australians are going to be significantly better off as a consequence of this, but there’s a lot more work to do, and that’s why we’re here in Canberra,” she told the ABC.

“We’re trying to bring the political parties and groups of Australians together so we can try to move some of the big issues in our country forward and certainly that issue around JobSeeker payments is one of them.”

Former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce said with the end of the fuel excise discount at the end of the month, cost of living pressures are set to increase.

“Real pressures are going on people and unless you want them in poverty, they need to be supported,” he told Seven on Monday.

JobSeeker, Parenting Payment, ABSTUDY and Rent Assistance recipients will also get a top up.

JobSeeker for singles without children will increase $25.70 a fortnight to $677.20, while Parenting Payment Single will rise $35.20 a fortnight to $927.40.

The rate for partnered JobSeeker Payment and Parenting Payment recipients will increase $23.40 a fortnight to $616.60.

The pension raise was driven by increases in the Consumer Price Index which exceeded the increase in the Pensioner and Beneficiary Living Cost Index.

Flagging the move in July, Treasurer Jim Chalmers said the government understood pensioners were doing it “incredibly tough when it comes to their costs of essentials like groceries, electricity and petrol and in other parts of the household budget”.

The increases also follow the government’s skills summit announcement that some pension recipients will be able to earn more without having payments reduced."
a567fedc-8778-4a24-a7b4-4e0989daceb0,"Centrelink payments will be given their biggest increase in 30 years to help recipients cope with the rising cost of living.

Jobseeker recipients aged over 22 and who do not have children will get another $25.70 a fortnight, while couples will be given an extra $23.40 from September 20.

The Parenting Payment will also increase, with singles receiving $35.20 more a fortnight and couples $23.40.

It marks the most significant increase for allowances in three decades, with pensions also set to get their largest boost to indexation in 12 years.

Some 4.7million people will benefit from the increase as inflation continues to grow with the rate at 6.1 per cent and likely to rise to 7.75 per cent by the end of the year.

The Age and Disability Support Pensions and Carer Payment will increase drastically with singles receiving $38.90 more a fortnight and couples $58.80.

The maximum rate of a pension will increase with singles receiving $1,026.50 a fortnight and couples getting $1,547.60.

Treasurer Jim Chalmers said the increases were crucial to ease cost of living pressures.

'That's why they're indexed twice a year, and every little bit helps,' he said.

'This indexation will be particularly big this month, because inflation is particularly challenging.'

The consumer price index in the June quarter soared at the steepest pace since mid-2001, with prices continuing to rise for everyday Australians

A tight rental vacancy market and higher power prices prompted housing costs to surge by nine per cent in the year to June 30.

Transport costs went up by 13.1 per cent while food prices increased by 5.9 per cent.

Mr Chalmers admitted that 'times will still be tough' for a lot of people.

'And we know that it won't solve every problem for everybody, but it's important that we try and make sure that those payments keep up,' he said.

'That's what the indexation is about. It will be welcome even as we acknowledge that times will still be tough for a lot of people.'

Environment and water minister Tanya Plibersek said the increase was more good news for pensioners after it was revealed at the Jobs Summit last week they could earn another $4,000 without it affecting their payments from Centrelink.

'It means they can earn a bit of extra money on the side. It’s also important for the economy because we’ve seen skills shortages in so many areas,' she told Sunrise.

'If people can go back and do a bit of work and relieve some of those skills shortages, that’s good for employers too.'

Australian Council of Social Service acting chief executive Edwina MacDonald said more money was needed to help recipients.

'It's really just a drop in the ocean at this point and as the non-discretionary inflation is higher than the CPI, they are still going backwards in terms of what they can afford to buy at the moment,' she said.

'So, currently jobseeker is at $46 a day, youth allowance is at $38 a day and what we need in order to bring it up to the poverty line, is to bring it up to at least $70 a day.'

The increase comes with cost of living set to increase further when the temporary fuel excise freeze ends on September 29.

Mr Chalmers has ruled out extending the tax cut that was introduced by former prime minister Scott Morrison.

The price of petrol is set to skyrocket for Aussie motorists by the end of the month with those filling up a 60litre tank set to pay an extra $15 at the pump

Why welfare payments are indexed Welfare payments are adjusted in line with movements in the Consumer Price Index. The process is known as indexing and allows the payments to maintain the same purchasing power when cost of living increases. JobSeeker Payment, Parenting Payment Partnered and Special Benefit rates are tweaked on March 20 and September 20 every year. The same goes for the Age Pension, Service Pension, Disability Support Pension and Carer Payment. Youth Allowance and Austudy rates are only adjusted once every year - usually on January 1.

'It would be too expensive to continue that petrol price relief indefinitely,' he said.

'I think Australians understand that we've inherited a budget which is heaving with a trillion dollars in Liberal Party debt and that means some difficult decisions including this one.'

Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce said the removal of the fuel excise would just add more pain to families already struggling to make ends meet.

'Well, we’re seeing a lot of pressures by cost of living, and we know at the end of the month the fuel excise goes and a lot of those increases will be gobbled up just in one item alone – fuel increases,' he said.

'We know it’s an inflation period and interest rates will also rise and so real pressures are going on people and they need – unless you want them in poverty, they need to be supported.'"
130f8b08-9e4a-40d6-8172-cc6ce959575f,"Morgan Stanley’s been widely credited, at least among the major Wall Street banks, for correctly predicting the rough ride that stocks would endure this year.

Morgan Stanley strategist Mike Wilson says there’s more pain in store, but for a different reason.

What’s hit U.S. stocks so much this year– the S&P 500 SPX, +3.09% has dropped 18% — has been the surge in interest rates. After all, earnings per share estimates for the next 12 months only dropped 1.5%, and price-to-earnings ratios were actually 9% higher, at the lows of June.

“With the Fed emphatically dashing hopes for a dovish pivot, we think that asset markets may be entering fire and ice part deux. In contrast with part one, this time the decline in stocks will come mostly via a higher [equity risk premium] and lower earnings rather than higher rates,” says Wilson.

Morgan Stanley says its earnings model, based on inputs including the ISM manufacturing report, the Conference Board’s consumer confidence index, housing starts and credit spreads, suggests a big drop in earnings to come. Another model, based mostly on regional Fed data, also is forecasting an earnings slump.

The equity risk premium is the return that investing in the stock market provides over a risk-free rate.

Wilson says the firm is more confident, however, that bonds have bottomed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury TMUBMUSD10Y, 3.632% was 3.19% on Friday.

“If Friday marked a short-term low for long-duration bonds (high in yields), the S&P 500 and many stocks could get some relief again as rates come down prior to the next round of earnings cuts. However, make no mistake, as the weather turns chilly this fall, so will growth, which will weigh mightily on stocks given the paltry ERP investors are getting paid to take this risk,” he said.

edd5d5ff-ffd6-4cfc-b43e-8768c81bee91,"If you think the stock market pullback presents a buying opportunity, you may want to think again.

One of the smarter investors in the market believes you’re off-target.

“There’s a good chance we have not seen the lows yet,” says Justin White, who manages the T. Rowe Price All-Cap Opportunities Fund PRWAX.

Before we get to his rationale, consider the following. White is worth listening to because his $7.9 billion fund handily beats his Morningstar Direct large cap growth category by four percentage points annualized over the past five years. That’s huge.

Second, he does have several favorite stocks that he thinks could do well in the economic conditions that lie ahead. We will get to those, below.

But first, here are two main reasons to be skeptical of bulls who claim the bottom is in.

1. The decline felt too calm. “There were a couple days of panic in mid-June, but overall, it was kind of an orderly selloff. This is not what bottoms feel like,” says White, who was an investment analyst during the 2008-2009 bear market. “We are in this slow-motion process.”

He describes the S&P 500 SPX, Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA and Nasdaq COMP strength since mid-June as a “revenge rally.” This means people were buying the types of stocks that worked in 2019 through 2021, like profitless tech companies and the FAANGs.

That’s a big problem. Normally, leadership changes when bear markets inflect into bull markets.

“People feel like they want to tiptoe into risk again,” he says. “They are going back to the playbook of a few years ago. I would believe the rally is sustainable if the leadership looked different.”

2. There’s no way we should get out of a bout of 9% inflation at such little cost in terms of economic and stock market damage. “In the modern era, the Fed has not been able to soft-land from inflation above 5%,” says White. “It is going to be really hard for them to avoid recession.”

One challenge is that negative real rates have never killed off inflation, he says. This is a reference to the fact that nominal interest rates are around 3% and inflation is above 8%.

White thinks the Fed will have to raise the Fed funds rate above 5%. That’ll be jarring to a lot of investors because the current Fed target range is half that, at 2.25%-2.5%. “We will have a bottom when we are in the recession. That is usually how it happens,” says White.

Not all bleak

The good news is any recession will not be severe, White predicts. That’s because there are no major imbalances in the economy — like the excessive leverage that contributed to the 2008-2009 financial crisis.

White also identifies companies he thinks are worth owning because their results won’t be impacted too much by economic slowdown and inflation. He’s not talking about classic defensive companies that sell staples, such as Colgate Palmolive CL, Procter & Gamble PG or utilities. “The market has crowded into those names. The valuations look like you are not going to make money in them.”

Instead, he favors stocks that might not hold up quite as well as defensive names in the near term, but will significantly outperform in two or three years because they have one or more of the four main characteristics he seeks.

I think you can learn a lot about investing by studying the four traits he favors, and the examples below.

1. Quality companies

Visa: The profit margins at this asset-light credit card company are so high, that even if revenue growth slows a bit, that won’t erode margins or earnings too much. Visa V is “quality,” in part, because it benefits from being in a duopoly with Mastercard MA, and the tailwind of ongoing migration away from the use of cash.

Assuming Covid remains in remission, Visa will also benefit as Asian countries emerge from lockdown and open their borders. Visa is White’s largest position at 4.59% of his portfolio at the end of June, according to Morningstar Direct. This is his biggest overweight compared to his benchmark. Both factors indicate very high conviction in the name. One risk here is proposed regulation in Washington, D.C., that would effectively lower credit card fees, but White is skeptical that this will pass.

Microsoft and Apple: Apple is a high-quality business in White’s view because it is the dominant hardware and software platform in smartphones, and it keeps gaining market share. “People keep migrating to the Apple platform and customer satisfaction rates are through-the-roof high,” he says. Risks include worsening U.S.-Chinese relations, especially a stepped-up conflict over Taiwan. A lot of Apple’s supply chain is in China, and it buys a lot of chips from Taiwan Semiconductor TSM.

Microsoft is a quality name because its software is so entrenched among businesses. That makes it easier for customers to migrate to Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform. A risk is that IT spending could slow during a recession. “But they would get through it just fine, and they would probably be stronger on the other side.” White is underweight his benchmark in this name.

2. Companies where the consensus opinion misses the big potential

Here he cites the pharma giant Eli Lilly LLY. Lilly has a rich pipeline because it spends so much on research and development — 20% of sales. That is more than the mid-teens average for the industry, notes Morningstar Direct analyst Damien Conover.

But what really stands out for White is Lilly’s recently approved type 2 diabetes treatment called Mounjaro. While it is not technically a weight-loss drug, people who take Mounjaro lose up to 25 pounds. So, doctors can, and will, prescribe it for obesity.

White doesn’t think it’s a coincidence that Lilly’s name for this drug rhymes with Kilimanjaro, or that the logo for this drug is shaped like a mountain summit. He takes this as a sign that Lilly thinks Mounjaro will be its biggest drug ever.

“The launch is off to a very strong start. It feels like it is going to be a blockbuster like we haven’t seen before.” White thinks it could eventually bring in more than $20 billion a year in revenue. “People are excited about this launch, but Mounjaro is not reflected in the numbers, if you look out two to three years,” he says.

Lilly also has an Alzheimer’s drug in late-stage development, called donanemab. This could be big if it works out, since Alzheimer’s therapies remain elusive. Phase III trial results are due out next year.

3. Companies that look cheap versus their intrinsic value

White cites T-Mobile TMUS. The carrier has bulked up against AT&T T and Verizon Communications VZ by purchasing spectrum at auction and through its Sprint merger — which will also bring cost savings. “Right now, T-Mobile is spending capital to integrate, but once that is done, the savings will come through,” says White.

He thinks Wall Street analysts underestimate how much free cash flow will improve over the next few years. “It looks inexpensive for a share gainer in an industry that is not very economically sensitive and increasing pricing for first time in a decade,” he says. By now T-Mobile has the best network in the U.S., says White. It charges less than AT&T and Verizon. And it has a brand that resonates with Gen Z and millennials. “T-Mobile has played their hand beautify,” says White.

4. Companies with improving fundamentals

Formula 1 racing has long been popular in Europe, but now it’s picking up fans in the Middle East and the U.S., thanks in part to the Netflix NFLX documentary “Formula 1: Drive to Survive.” This means the company Liberty Media Formula One FWONA can boost revenue by increasing what it charges for advertising and sponsorships. “This is a unique sports asset that is under-monetized on a global basis,” says White.

Inflation beaters

White singles out three companies that could benefit directly from elevated inflation, which he thinks will be with us for a while.

Chubb: Customers will continue to need property casualty insurance even in a recession. Meanwhile, most of Chubb’s CB contracts are for one year. So, it can reprice policies and offset inflation.

Energy companies: Commodity companies with real assets can do well during inflationary times since they charge more for their products. In this space, he added Valero Energy VLO and Baker Hughes BKR as new positions during the first quarter, according to Morningstar Direct.

The energy-refining company Valero will benefit from shortages of refining capacity. Competitors have been reluctant to add capacity because of the popularity of electric vehicles and ESG.

“The world is short refining capacity. If you don’t get demand destruction, their margins will be high,” he says.

The oil-services company Baker Hughes should see improved business as energy producers step up development and production, and as they build liquid natural gas (LNG) plants because of shortages of natural gas in Europe and elsewhere. Baker Hughes sells turbines used in those plants.

James Davolos, a portfolio manager in the top 1% over the past 10 years, shared his market outlook.

Here's how Davolos selects stocks — and six of his top picks right now.

The massive rally the stock market has enjoyed this summer is slipping away fast.

There's been much debate among market pundits as to whether the S&P 500 will fall back to its mid-June low of 3,636 or suddenly rebound and retest record highs — or perhaps it will do both.

A recent string of losing sessions for the widely followed US stock index suggests that investors are bracing for more pain ahead. Like many investors, James Davolos, a top-performing portfolio manager who co-manages the Kinetics Small Cap Opportunities Fund (KSCOX), doesn't foresee a dramatic rally taking place anytime soon.

""I don't know if we're going to see lower lows, but it's really hard to envision a scenario where we make all-time highs,"" Davolos told Insider in a late August interview. ""Gun to my head, I would say we're much more likely to retest lows than highs.""

Admittedly, Davolos knows that he can't predict exactly the future, especially given the ""tremendous amount of uncertainty"" that he said is facing the economy as the Federal Reserve warns of pain ahead as it struggles to get rampant inflation under control.

But investors would be forgiven for thinking that Davolos has a crystal ball. His fund has outperformed 99% of peers, both this year and in the past 10 years, according to Morningstar, and has logged top-3% finishes in 2012, 2013, 2017, 2018, and 2021.

Davolos told Insider about his market outlook, his fund's strategy, and his favorite stock picks.

Inflation may persist, even as the economy slows

Economic strength is fading fast as leading indicators start to roll over, Davolos said. For instance, the latest reading of the Empire State Manufacturing Survey, which details business conditions in New York state, was the weakest it's been since mid-2009, he noted.

It's clear to Davolos that the Fed's aggressive interest rate hikes aimed at combating inflation are having an effect, but it may not be the one that the US central bank is hoping for. There's a chance that higher borrowing costs result in a spike in unemployment without bringing down what Davolos called ""extremely elevated"" inflation. That would be investors' worst nightmare.

""I think the Fed's going to have a really tough time balancing employment goals with inflation goals,"" Davolos said. ""I think that, ultimately, the lesser evil is going to be an acceptably higher level of inflation.""

Davolos said he's preparing for higher-for-longer inflation in the 3% to 6% range. That will put pressure on corporate profit margins and, by extension, earnings, the portfolio manager warned.

""Regardless of what happens to the economy in nominal or real terms — whether companies can continue to grow the top line — the one guarantee is that profit margins are going to be squeezed,"" Davolos said. ""Because everything from raw materials, to labor, to transportation — all of these costs are going up, and I think they're going to be really sticky.""

Markets aren't pricing in a decline in earnings, Davolos said, echoing a concern recently voiced by Mike Wilson, the chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley. The Fed won't pivot away from their hawkish policies, Davolos said, which will catch investors offside as the economy weakens.

""I don't think the market has even remotely become close to — at least in terms of forward earnings forecasts — I think we're only down like 2% or 3% — maybe 4% — from peak forward earnings estimates,"" Davolos said. ""I think the average recession is about 22%. If you factor in margin compression with that, it's a pretty tough setup for the broader market.""

How to invest: 3 tips to remember

There are three pillars to the success of Davolos' fund, the portfolio manager said: keeping a long time horizon, avoiding stocks that are heavy in indexes, and focusing on valuations.

Focusing on the long term is a simple tip that's easy to forget in a 24/7 news cycle. While investors should follow what's going on in the economy and markets, overreacting to day-to-day changes can backfire.

""So many people are concerned with what the quarter's going to look like or the year is going to look like,"" Davolos said. ""But we think that if you push your view out and try to assess value over a period of several years, you have a much higher degree of success.""

The next two pillars are related. Davolos tries to avoid stocks that are large components in indexes because they are then included in popular funds and get blindly bought by investors, which results in these stocks becoming overinflated and eventually ripe for a decline.

""There's been a tremendous amount of distortion in financial markets by virtue of valuation-agnostic buying from indices,"" Davolos said.

That so-called distortion is an issue because high valuations can tank stocks, as investors have learned this year. Buying shares of companies that have solid growth, capital expenditure, cash flow, and profit margins is critical, Davolos said, and it's rarely done by following the crowd.

""In order to be good at value investing and seek out value opportunities, you do need to have a reasonable degree of contrarian thinking,"" Davolos said.

Top stock picks

After finding the right stocks to buy, it makes little sense to water a portfolio down by including too many names, in Davolos' view. That's why he said his fund tends to be ""fairly concentrated and fairly top-heavy"" in 25 to 45 names, with outsized weightings in 10 of those.

""Basically, we do a lot of rigorous research, and we want to own the best companies at size rather than a broad representation of the industry,"" Davolos said.

Similarly, after finding the right names, Davolos usually keeps them in the Kinetics Small Cap Opportunities Fund for five to seven years, he said. Davolos said the fund scales in or out of stocks instead of buying or selling them all at once, unless there's an ""extraordinary situation.""

Below are six stocks that fit Davolos' criteria and are among his favorite stocks. Along with each is its ticker, market capitalization, price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, and commentary from Davolos."

Fresh lockdowns in China are also fuelling concerns about global growth, while high energy costs as a result of the war in Ukraine are weighing on European markets.

""The market is laser-focused on how aggressive the Fed is going to be with its hiking cycle,"" said Giles Coghlan, chief currency analyst at HYCM, pointing out that expectations for higher rates have solidified since a speech last week by Fed chair Jerome Powell at the Jackson Hole central banking conference.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S stocks closed out the trading week on a down note on Friday, as early gains from a jobs report that showed a labor market that may be starting to loosen gave way to worries about the European gas crisis.

Wall Street opened sharply higher after the August U.S. payrolls report showed stronger-than-expected hiring but a climb in the unemployment rate to 3.7% eased some concerns about the Federal Reserve being overly aggressive in raising interest rates as it attempts to bring down high inflation.

However, gains were erased after Gazprom, the state-controlled firm with a monopoly on Russian gas exports to Europe via pipeline which were due to restart on Saturday, said it could not safely restart deliveries until it had fixed an oil leak found in a vital turbine and did not give a new time frame.

""Definitely the afternoon overshadowing the good data from this morning, the afternoon has been stolen from us by those headlines out of Europe,"" said Zach Hill head of portfolio management at Horizon Investments in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Analysts also pointed to thin trading volumes ahead of the extended holiday weekend helping to exaggerate market moves.

""The setup is important, there has been some optimism around the European energy situation over the last week or so, long-dated power prices falling almost in half in some instances and signs that Germany had almost 80% of their storage full of gas, so what we are seeing is a little positioning adjustment against that backdrop coupled with a low liquidity Friday afternoon into a holiday weekend,"" said Hill.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 337.98 points, or 1.07%, to 31,318.44; the S&P 500 lost 42.59 points, or 1.07%, to 3,924.26; and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 154.26 points, or 1.31%, to 11,630.86.

Markets are closed on Monday for the Labor Day holiday.

Energy was the only major S&P sector to end the session in positive territory, up 1.81%.

While payrolls topped expectations, average hourly earnings rose 0.3% compared with estimates of 0.4%, while the unemployment rate edged up to 3.7% from a pre-pandemic low of 3.5%, indicating that the Fed's efforts to front-load rate hikes were beginning to take effect.

Wage growth data is seen as important to the Fed's deliberations on increasing interest rates as the central bank looks to bring inflation, running at four-decades high, back to its 2% target. Expectations for a third straight 75 basis point hike from the central bank at its September meeting fell to 56%, according to CME's FedWatch Tool https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/fed-funds.html, down from 75% the day prior.

The focus now shifts to the August consumer price report due mid-month, the last major data available before the Fed's Sept. 20-21 policy meeting.

Fears of aggressive policy tightening have sent stocks lower after hitting a four-month high in mid-August, with the S&P 500 falling about 7% since the day before Fed Chair Jerome Powell's hawkish remarks last week about rate hikes. His views were later echoed by other policymakers.

All the three main indexes suffered their third straight weekly loss, as the Dow fell 2.99%, the S&P 500 declined 3.29% and the Nasdaq dropped 4.21%.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.95 billion shares, compared with the 10.48 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.34-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.65-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted three new 52-week highs and 14 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 47 new highs and 184 new lows.

A survey from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) showed the US services industry picked up in August for the second straight month amid stronger order growth and employment while supply bottlenecks and price pressures eased.

However, numbers from S&P Global showed the services sector Purchasing Managers' Index fell short of flash estimates for August.

A stronger than expected reading on the US services sector fuelled expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates to tame inflation.

""The Fed has relegated us to being very data dependent, so every piece of information that comes out investors are going to look not only at the absolute level but try to infer what that means for when the Fed meets,"" said Carol Schleif, deputy chief investment officer at BMO Family Office.

""One of the things that is disconcerting to investors is that there's really little to propel markets either up solidly or down solidly,"" she added.

Concerns over the supply of energy to Europe and how COVID-19 lockdowns will impact China's economy also drove markets down on Tuesday, said Shawn Cruz, head trading strategist at TD Ameritrade.

The focus will be on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech on Thursday as well as US consumer price data next week for clues on the path of monetary policy.

Markets started September on a weak note, extending a slide that started at the end of August, as hawkish comments from Fed policymakers and data signalling US economic momentum raised fears of aggressive interest rate hikes.

The S&P is down nearly 18 per cent so far this year while the Nasdaq has shed more than 26 per cent as rising interest rates hurt megacap technology and growth stocks.

Among the major S&P sectors, energy and communication services were among the worst performers while defensive utilities and real estate rose.

The S&P 500 lost 15.57 points, or 0.36 per cent, to end at 3,910.16 points, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 84.94 points, or 0.73 per cent, to 11,545.92 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 148.35 points, or 0.47 per cent, to 31,155.72.

Us stocks opened lower Monday as investor sentiment remained sour following steep losses from Friday's session.

Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell remained steadfast in his Friday remarks in Wyoming that the central bank's priority is taming inflation. Wall Street had shown signs of optimism in previous sessions that the Fed would pull back in its tightening schedule on the heels of a better than expected inflation report last month.

""Fed Chair Powell broke no new ground in Friday's Jackson Hole speech, but he offered very little to anyone hoping for a shift away from his recent hawkishness, still less anything that could be characterized as dovish,"" Ian Sheperdson, chief economist and Pantheon Macroeconomics wrote in report Monday.

Sheperdson added that ""the one glimmer of hope"" was Powell's acknowledgement that price pressures were mostly due to the battle between supply and demand constraints.

Bitcoin Falls Below $20K

By James Rubin

After clinging tenaciously to support above $20,000 for much of the weekend, bitcoin fell well below this threshold late Sunday.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $19,600, down more than 2% over the previous 24 hours. Ether, the second-largest crypto in market value, was recently changing hands at roughly $1,430, down more than 4% as investors continued to chew over U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's vow to continue the monetary hawkishness the Fed adopted earlier this year.

That news disappointed some investors hoping for signs of Fed confidence that its steps the last few months were taming inflation and that it might back away from its recent diet of 75 basis point interest rate hikes.

""The macroeconomic uncertainties continued to weigh on the price of BTC, and while the [Personal Consumption Expenditures] data came in negative (giving market hopes that the Fed could take a less aggressive stance moving forward), [the] Fed chair's talk on Friday dashed those hopes as he cautioned against premature policy loosening,"" Joe DiPasquale of crypto asset manager BitBull Capital wrote to CoinDesk. ""The market has reacted negatively to those comments and we're seeing bitcoin testing the $20,000 support.""

Most other major cryptos were recently in the red, with AVAX and ATOM down more than 9% and 6%, respectively. XMR rose about a percentage point.

On Friday, bitcoin fell precipitously from the $21,000 perch it held throughout the working week as Powell noted that inflation remains a serious threat. He said that ""reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth"" that would create ""softer labor markets,"" among other impacts.

Story continues

The ongoing strength of the job market has suggested repeatedly that the economy has not fallen into recession. The 3.5% unemployment rate is the lowest level since February 2020. ""While higher interest rates, slower growth and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses,"" Powell said.

“We are moving our policy stance purposefully to a level that will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2%,” Powell said.

Equities and crypto news

Cryptos in the late week fall tracked equity markets, which closed substantially lower on Friday, with the tech-focused Nasdaq and S&P 500 plunging nearly 4% and 3.3%, respectively.

In recent crypto industry news :

Japan is preparing to review existing corporate crypto tax rates in an effort to entice startups to remain in the country, local news outlet Yomiuri reported. Japan's financial services agency (FSA) and the ministry of economy, trade and industry are considering a tax reform proposal for 2023 that could exempt crypto startups that issue their own tokens from paying taxes on unrealized gains.

Over the weekend, CoinDesk reported that Grayscale Investments LLC has been fielding questions from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the firm’s “securities law analysis” of tokens in some of its less-popular crypto trusts. The inquiry, which Grayscale disclosed in little-noticed filings made in June and mid-August, casts a shadow over the trusts’ viability at a time when the world’s largest digital asset manager is already dealing with a precipitous decline in its assets’ value due to the ongoing crypto winter.

Grayscale Investments is a digital asset management firm owned by Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.

BitBull's DiPasquale wrote that ""Monday's opening for equities will be key, as any more downside there could push BTC toward the recent lows.""

""We will be watching for the market's reactions to new lows and aiming to accumulate BTC between $20,000 and $15,000,"" he wrote.

Here's How Fed Observers Viewed Powell's Jackson Hole Speech

By James Rubin

Speeches by U.S. central bank chairs receive more scrutiny than any others by public officials except for U.S. Presidential addresses. They also draw some of the strongest reactions by analysts, investors and others who make a living observing monetary policy and the economy.

Even by these standards, Jerome Powell's remarks at the Fed's Economic Symposium on Friday drew particular attention, coming amid a flood of often confounding economic indicators, including July's decline in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) suggesting that inflation, which reached a 40-year high the previous month, was waning. Would Powell be a hawk, or signal a softening in interest rate hikes?

He sharpened his claws.

In the strongest terms, Powell said that inflation remained a menace to economic well-being and that the Fed would continue raising rates. “We will keep at it until we are confident the job is done,” he said.

Here's how a few commentators from major research and financial services groups view Powell's comments and the likely future impact of ongoing monetary hawkishness:

“They won’t want to be remembered as the central bank that missed inflation or even spurred inflation higher,” said Brian O’Reilly, head of market strategy at Mediolanum International Funds, told The Wall Street Journal.

“The process won’t be painless, and I think he’s being more upfront about that,” said Neil Dutta, head of U.S. economics at Renaissance Macro Research, told The New York Times. “The likelihood of recession is rising, because that’s the solution to the inflation problem – that’s what they’re telling you.”

Powell is not budging on having restrictive policy and that should mean the economy will steadily weaken going forward,"" Oanda Senior Market Analyst Edward Moya wrote in an email. Powell drove home the point that when they are done raising rates that we should expect them to stay there for a long period of time ... There was no dovish pivot, but it seems financial markets are getting close to fully pricing in the remaining Fed rate hikes.""

“In essence, Powell is clearly stating that right now, fighting inflation is more important than supporting growth,” said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial, told CNBC.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, speaking at the Jackson Hole symposium on Friday, said the Fed would raise rates as high as needed to restrict growth, and keep them there ""for some time"" to bring down inflation running well above its 2 per cent target.

European Central Bank board member Isabel Schnabel added to market unease. She warned on Saturday that central banks risk losing public trust and must act forcefully to curb inflation, even if that drags their economies into a recession.

As investors woke up to the reality that rates would stay higher for longer even as recession risk grows, two-year US treasury yields rose to their highest since 2007.

European stocks slumped to their lowest level in almost six weeks and were last down 1 per cent. US stock futures were deep in the red and Japan's blue-chip Nikkei slid over 2.5 per cent

London markets were closed for a holiday, while MSCI's world equity index fell 0.7 per cent to a one-month low.

""The message from Jackson Hole was loud and clear and not what markets were expecting,"" said Nordea chief analyst Jan von Gerich.

""Central banks need convincing evidence that inflation is coming down. That is bad news for the economy and risk appetite and raises the risk of a deeper recession if we get more rapid rate hikes.""

Investors ramped up US and euro zone rate hike bets, with markets pricing in a greater chance of 75 basis point hikes from the Fed and ECB in September.

Fed funds futures priced in as high as a 73 per cent chance the Fed will hike by 75 bps and see rates peaking at 3.75 per cent to 4.0 per cent.

""Markets are focusing on discussing the message of 'coordinated tightening' from Jackson Hole as ECB and Fed appear to have re-committed to creating price stability: yields are shooting higher and risk assets are quite a bit lower since last week,"" said Lars Sparreso Lykke Merklin, senior analyst at Danske Bank.

Much might depend on what US August payrolls figures show this Friday. Analysts are looking for a moderate rise of 285,000 following July's blockbuster 528,000 gain.

As investors hunkered down for front-loaded rate hikes, key gauges of equity market volatility shot up.

The CBOE Volatility index, widely dubbed Wall Street's fear index, rose to its highest since mid-July. The euro STOXX volatility index, the European equivalent, jumped to its highest level in six weeks.

The aggressive chorus from central banks lifted short-term yields globally, while further inverting the Treasury curve as investors priced in an eventual economic downturn.

Two-year US yields surged to around 3.49 per cent, the highest since late 2007 and far above the 10-year at 3.13 per cent. Yields also jumped across Europe.

This all benefited the safe-haven dollar, which shot to a fresh two-decade peak at 109.48 against a basket of major currencies.

The dollar hit a five-week peak on the yen and was last up 0.75 per cent at 138.66, with bulls looking to re-test its July top of 139.38.

Sterling sank to a 2-1/2-year low of $1.1649 as Goldman Sachs warned the UK was heading for recession. The euro was struggling at $0.9950, and not far from last week's two-decade trough of $0.99005.

""Energy security fears will remain front and centre this week as Gazprom will shut its mainline pipeline to deliver gas to Western Europe for three days from 31 August to 2 September,"" said Joseph Capurso, head of international economics at CBA, referring to supplies from Russian gas giant Gazprom.

""There are fears gas supply may not be turned back on following the shutdown.""

Those fears saw natural gas futures in Europe surge 38 per cent last week, adding further fuel to the inflation bonfire.

The benchmark S&P 500 index has tumbled more than 5.0 per cent since Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Friday reaffirmed the central bank's determination to raise interest rates even in the face of a slowing economy.

Labour demand showed no signs of cooling as US job openings rose to 11.239 million in July and the prior month was revised sharply higher.

A separate report showed consumer confidence rebounded strongly in August after three straight monthly declines.

""They have to weaken the labour market and how are they going to do that - they are going to jam rates and make things so expensive that people are going to pull back, demand is going to fall off and people are going to get laid off,"" said Ken Polcari, managing partner at Kace Capital Advisors in Boca Raton, Florida.

""It locks them in even further.""

The data increases the focus on the August non-farm payrolls data due on Friday.

The S&P 500 lost 44.47 points, or 1.10 per cent, to end at 3,986.14 points, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 128.85 points, or 1.07 per cent, to 11,888.82 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 308.68 points, or 0.95 per cent, to 31,790.31.

New York Fed President John Williams said on Tuesday the central bank will likely need to get its policy rate to about 3.5 per cent and is unlikely to cut interest rates at all next year as it fights inflation.

However, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said in an essay published on Tuesday the Fed could ""dial back"" from its recent string of 75 basis point hikes if new data shows inflation is ""clearly"" slowing while Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said the Fed's pledge to bring inflation down to its 2.0 per cent goal will not necessarily result in a severe recession.

Traders are pricing in a 74.5 per cent chance of a third straight 75-basis point rate hike at the Fed's September meeting.

Each of the 11 S&P 500 sectors were in negative territory, with the energy sector the biggest percentage decliner as oil prices settled down more than 5.0 per cent on concerns that slowing of global economies could sap demand.

Rate-sensitive megacap growth and technology stocks such as Microsoft Corp and Apple Inc were among the biggest drags on the benchmark index.

Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have broken below their 50-day moving average.

The S&P 500 also briefly fell below the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement level from its June low to August high, another key technical indicator watched by analysts as support.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Friday the US economy would need tight monetary policy ""for some time"" before inflation is under control, dashing hopes the Fed might pivot to more subdued rate hikes after recent data suggested price pressures were peaking.

The S&P 500 recovered from session lows that put it down 1.0 per cent at the lowest in a month but the benchmark index still notched its biggest two-day percentage decline in two and a half months.

""Friday's sell-off was frankly overdone, I know (Powell) said he was going to play tough with inflation but it is honestly not that much different than what he has been saying for the last several weeks, he was a little more hawkish but I mean, geez, who is surprised by that, really?"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.

""I don't see a whole lot of up or downside here in the near term, I see a lot of volatility and that is probably going to be the case at the very least until we get past the September 21 rate hike.""

The S&P 500 lost 28.04 points, or 0.69 per cent, to end at 4,029.62 points, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 129.90 points, or 1.07 per cent, to 12,011.81 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 183.01 points, or 0.57 per cent, to 32,100.24.

Megacap technology and growth stocks such as Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp were among the biggest drags on the index as Treasury yields rose.

The CBOE's volatility index, Wall Street's fear gauge, hit a seven-week high of 27.67 points.

Money market traders are pricing in a 72.5 per cent chance of a 75-basis-point interest rate hike at the Fed's September meeting, which would be the third straight hike of that magnitude.

They expect the Fed funds rate to end the year at about 3.7 per cent.

The two-year Treasury yield, which is particularly sensitive to interest rate expectations, briefly touched a 15-year high while the closely watched yield curve measured by the gap between two and 10-year yields remained firmly inverted.

An inversion is considered by many to be a reliable signal of a looming recession.

Economic data this week is highlighted by the August non-farm payrolls report due on Friday.

Any signs of a slowdown in the labour market might take pressure off the Fed to continue with outsized rate hikes.

The S&P 500 climbed nearly 11 per cent since mid-June through Friday's close.

It recently found support just above its 50-day moving average although it remains well below its 200-day moving average.

Despite the rebound, some investors remain worried as September approaches due to the historical weakness for stocks during the month and the anticipated hike from the Fed.

Mortgage holders have this year been dealing with a financial double whammy - high living costs and increased interest rates as the Reserve Bank seeks to quell those inflationary pressures.

For more Personal Finance related news and videos check out Personal Finance >>

Since April, the RBA has increased the rate from 0.1 per cent to 1.85 per cent in August.

While the rise may not have resulted in large numbers of people defaulting on their mortgage payments, some economists believe the authority will seek to bring the rate up to more than 3 per cent.

“We certainly have had an increase in people who are anxious about the rising interest rates,” National Debt Helpline financial counsellor Deb Shroot told 7NEWS.com.au.

“Some of them are in stress already and already struggling with repayments.

“Other people are calling because they’re anxious about what’s going to happen, because they know in the future they’re really going to struggle.”

The most recent Roy Morgan data shows more than 17 per cent of mortgage holders - or 762,000 people - were at risk of mortgage stress in the first three months of the year. That was when interest rates were still at 0.1 per cent.

So, what can people do if they are under mortgage stress?

What should you do first?

Shroot says one of the first things people must do is understand why they are under duress.

“It could be because of the cost of living. It could be because interest rates are rising,” she said.

“Is it because you had an unexpected expense or maybe overcommitted with added debt?

“But also, some people may have had a change in circumstance.

“For example, they might be a casual worker and not getting the hours they were getting previously. Maybe someone in their family was sick. There could be separation issues as well, or domestic violence.”

Are there ways you can cut the fat?

Another early step to address mortgage stress is to check discretionary spending.

As well as trying to shop around for a better deal on such things as utilities and groceries, Shroot urges people to ensure they are claiming any discounts they may be entitled to via a concession card.

For example, some concession card holders may be entitled to a rebate on their power bills.

When it comes to figuring out options, Shroot advises people to determine whether their financial difficulties are short, medium or long-term.

A person whose earning capacity has been impacted by something such as chronic illness would be facing long-term difficulties, for example.

Such a determination will “dictate the options that will be available”, she said.

Be open and honest

One of the biggest pieces of advice is for people to be open and forthright with their bank or lender.

Chris de Bruin, Westpac’s head of consumer banking, said customers should know help is available when needed.

“We encourage customers who would like to discuss their home loan to give us a call so we can talk through their options,” he told 7NEWS.com.au.

“For those who need additional support our hardship team is ready to assist with a range of tailored support options.

“Sometimes customers can feel embarrassed about calling their bank, but the sooner we know there is an issue the faster we can tailor a solution to help.”

Hardship options

Shroot says the earlier a customer engages with their bank, the better.

“The earlier you engage, the more options are going to be available for you. I would say, engage early, be open with your bank,” she said.

“They might have some solutions available for you that you might not be aware of.

“There are hardship programs they might be able to offer you.

“If you do qualify for a hardship option, it might include no payments for a certain period of time, for example.

“Sometimes the bank is able to offer you a cheaper or more suitable product.

“The bank is able to help you with whatever products you have with the bank but, if there is more going on, or you have multiple debts, then a financial counsellor can look at everything.”

Determining those options isn’t a one-size-fits-all exercise, Shroot says.

There will be a range of different factors lenders consider in presenting options, including the equity in the borrower’s home, how many debts they have and what is causing the problems.

One of the options highlighted by de Bruin was moving to fixed loans.

“New and existing customers could fix their loan which may provide more certainty over their repayments or split their loan between fixed and variable rates,” he said.

“We’re also continuing to engage with customers coming off fixed rate terms to help them understand what options are available.”

What should you not do?

But the key message from Shroot for people undergoing mortgage stress is to do something about it.

“Don’t ignore notices. Don’t ignore the fact you’re going to default on your loan,” she said.

“If you receiving communication from your bank, it’s possible this is forming part of a formal process to repossess your home.

“But, in saying that, don’t panic either, because there is a very formal process that the bank needs to go through to repossess your home. Banks don’t want to repossess people’s home.

“They do want to help people to keep paying. It’s not a good outcome for anyone to force a sale.”"

Based on volume-weighted technical indicators, Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at BTIG, expects 3,900 will likely serve as the next key support level for stocks. While Krinsky doesn’t presently expect stocks to return to their mid-June lows, a sustained break below 3,900 by the S&P 500 SPX, +3.09% might be enough to change his mind.

“At this point we do not expect the June lows to be broken, but a meaningful break under 3,900 would have us re-evaluate that thesis,” Krinsky said.

Krinsky is hardly alone in expecting more pain for stocks in the near term.

Since the start of the year, U.S. stocks have had a tendency to chase momentum, exacerbating moves both to the downside and the upside. Based on this, Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, pointed out on Monday that Friday’s drawdown marked the seventh time this year that the S&P 500 has fallen by 3% or more in a single session.

Colas crunched the numbers and found that, since the start of 2022, the average one-week forward return for the S&P 500 has been minus 0.4%.

“The history of down +3 percent days in 2022 says not to expect much of a near-term bounce back from Friday’s rout. In fact, one could justify being quite cautious here,” Colas said.

Krinsky also highlighted some discouraging trends in Apple Inc. AAPL, +4.86% , one of the market’s most consequential stocks thanks to its massive market capitalization, which is north of $2.5 trillion.

According to Krinsky, Apple shares, which were down more than 2% on Monday, look vulnerable for the following reasons: until last week, Apple shares had exceeded the stock’s 50-day moving average by one of the largest margins seen over the past 7 years.

Earlier this month, analysts like Colas and others have pointed to this outperformance as a sign of froth in markets. Turns out, they were correct. Now, Krinsky fears Apple could help lead markets lower.

Technically, the U.S. stock market has been in a bear market downturn for months, since the S&P 500 dropped 20% from its last peak and officially entered a bear spiral.

Since then, the market appears to have taken a turn for the better. Between the index’s mid-June low and last week, the S&P 500 rebounded by over 17%, building on several weeks’ worth of consistent gains.

But does this mean the bear market is drawing to a close and it is time to buy? Maybe not, according to analysts from investment and wealth management firm Glenmede.

The recent bounce is looking alarmingly similar to historical ""bear traps,"" the Glenmede analysts from the firm’s investment strategy division wrote in a Monday note to clients, warning investors that we have seen this type of market rally before, and investors should continue being cautious about how they interact with this cloudy market.

“The 17% rally off the June 16th low seems consistent with historical bear market rallies, on average returning over 17.8% before reversing course and hitting new market lows,” the Glenmede analysts wrote.

The bear trap

Glenmede’s team identified similar rebounds occurring during four historical bear markets dating back over the past 50 years.

Rallies happened on average 6.5 times during each bear period, and to the average tune of 17.8%, but in each instance, bounces proved to be short-lived and markets quickly regressed to plunge even deeper than their previous low.

This would be a case of a so-called “bear trap,” a trend that occurs when a stock price incorrectly and misleadingly switches from a downward spiral to an upward swing.

Bear traps can be a dangerous situation for unsuspecting investors, who can be pushed into shorting a stock on the expectation of a prolonged rise, while it is instead on the precipice of an even worse plummet.

Bear traps are similar to another false market indicator known as the “dead cat bounce.” The colorful term was coined in the San Jose Mercury Journal in 1986 by financial writer Raymond DeVoe Jr.

“This applies to stocks or commodities that have gone into free-fall descent and then rallied briefly. If you threw a dead cat off a 50-story building, it might bounce when it hit the sidewalk. But don’t confuse that bounce with renewed life. It is still a dead cat,” is how DeVoe described the concept.

Last week, UBS chief investment officer Mark Haefele cautioned investors against chasing the rally in a research note.

“We expect renewed market volatility ahead, and we continue to recommend positioning portfolios for resilience under various scenarios,” Haefele wrote.

A greater downturn in the market is certainly a possibility that investors should be aware of.

The U.S. economy has been shrinking for two consecutive quarters this year, according to last month’s GDP reading, a sign many economists are taking that a recession is on the way.

As many as 73% of economists surveyed by the National Association of Business Economics are either “not very confident” or “not at all confident” that the Federal Reserve will be able to avoid a recession within the next two years as the central bank works to bring down soaring inflation through a series of aggressive interest rate hikes, according to a report by the organization out this week.

Glenmede analysts toed a more cautious line on predicting a looming market downturn in their note.

It looks like a “bear trap” may be lurking in this summer’s big bounce for the stock market, one that could lead to painful losses for investors, Glenmede strategists warned in a Monday report.

Investors already appear to be reconsidering some factors of this summer’s powerful rebound, including rethinking hopes that the Federal Reserve may not hike interest rates as aggressively as previously thought.

The S&P 500 index has been hitting resistance after gaining nearly 17% from its mid-June low, and focus lately has turned to whether recent gains for equities could quickly fizzle, confirming a bear-market bounce.

That might sound like an aberration, but Glenmede’s investment strategy team found four instances of multiple bear-market bounces (see chart) in U.S. stocks over roughly the past 50 years, when examining periods after the S&P 500 initially plunge at least 20% from its prior peak.

Of the last six bear markets, four produced a series of short-lived rallies that had an average of 6.5 upswings. The S&P 500 confirmed its move into a bear market on June 13.

“The 17% rally off the June 16th low seems consistent with historical bear market rallies, on average returning over 17.8% before reversing course and hitting new market lows,” the Glenmede team wrote, in a Monday client note.

“While economic recession has not yet been confirmed, the path ahead will strongly depend on the different inflation and interest rate outcomes.”

Stocks were lower to kick off the week, with the S&P 500 down about 2% at last check after it closed Friday 15.3% below its 12-month closing low of 3,666.77 set on June 16, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 1.98% Monday, tumbling more than 600 points, while the 10-year Treasury yield was back above 3%. Higher benchmark borrowing rates can lead to slower economic growth by making borrowing for U.S. corporations and individuals more expensive.

Economists expect Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to stress this week at his Jackson Hole speech that a 2% inflation target remains a key focus, even if trying to achieve it means sparking a recession. The rate of inflation in the 12 months ended in July retreated to 8.5% from a 41-year high of 9.1% in June.

But Federal officials warned in July that the U.S. central bank could move into a “restrictive” stance of policy, enough to slow economic growth, while it works to cool inflation from its highest levels in decades.

ASIC chairman Joseph Longo told The Australian Financial Review on Monday there was a lot of market “hype” from green promoters.

“One of our priority areas is to really focus on the need to not be misleading and deceptive with their marketing and how they promote products,” he said.

“If people make outrageous claims about their green credentials and don’t have anything to back them up, that’s not something we are going to tolerate.

“We’re doing a lot of surveillance and we have a couple of matters under active investigation so you can expect us to be taking focused action.”

It is understood ASIC has inquiries underway into several listed entities, super funds and managed funds, with some at very early stages and others that are more advanced.

ASIC wants to ensure legitimate green finance players are not competitively disadvantaged by greenwashers so businesses can operate on a level playing field.

It is working closely with global regulators and standard setters on climate-related disclosures by companies and market participants.

Ageing population

As the superannuation sector grows beyond $3.4 trillion, ASIC will also ramp up surveillance of super products, marketing, distribution and advice by fund trustees and financial advisers.

“ASIC is very focused on the retirement decision-making and planning for Australians,” Mr Longo said.

“With the ageing of the population and people reaching that stage of life where they’re relying on income to support their retirement, I can’t think of a more important subject for the financial wellbeing of Australians.”

The former Morrison government cracked down on performance reporting by super funds, in an effort to weed out dud funds.

Failing funds were forced to write to their members and recommend they switch to a better product by visiting the government’s YourSuper comparison tool.

Ten of the 13 products that failed the first performance assessment last year have merged with another super fund, or are in talks to do so.

The Albanese government is proposing to water down disclosure rules for political donations for the superannuation industry, prompting a backlash from a consumer advocacy group and opposition and crossbench MPs.

Treasury’s first Labor-directed consultation is canvassing the abolition of the requirement for funds to provide itemised lists of marketing and sponsorship expenses, as well as political donations and payments to industrial bodies at annual meetings of members.

Funds would instead provide aggregate figures for these categories, such that individual payments were no longer identifiable.

The definition of “related party” would also be aligned with the definition in Australian accounting standards, reducing the number of payments that would need to be disclosed.

Separately, ASIC will undertake core strategic projects focused on sustainable finance practices, crypto assets, scams, cyber and operational resilience, breach reporting, design and distribution obligations and, subject to the passage of legislation, the Financial Accountability Regime.

ASIC also sees risks from the Reserve Bank of Australia increasing interest rates.

“Rising interest rates pose risks for mortgage holders as repayments become more costly, after a prolonged period of low rates,” ASIC said.

“This is occurring against the backdrop of high levels of household debt and an increased proportion of new loans with a higher debt-to-income ratio.”

Mr Longo will expand on the corporate plan in a speech in Melbourne on Tuesday."
1edd08b0-8346-43e0-b0ab-ab7cb41afbe7,"“We’re very focused on administering the regulatory framework around superannuation jointly with APRA (Australian Prudential Regulation Authority). We’re very interested in making the system work for all Australians.”

‘Real implications’

Mr Longo said the corporate watchdog was zeroing in on sustainable finance claims to ensure Australia was able to continue to attract more than $4.1 trillion in foreign investment “to help power our industry, fund our services and create jobs”.

“As more and more Australian firms release financial reports and disclose climate risks, we need to speak the same language as our global peers,” he said, referring to the new International Sustainability Standards Board rules that are expected to be made mandatory in Australia over coming years.

He said the work being done by ASIC commissioners to define standards was urgent, given the country’s need to continue attracting capital.

“All that other work has real implications on capital raising, capital allocation in the economy,” he said.

But Mr Longo suggested disclosure obligations would probably be made mandatory over several years, “not the next 18 months”, and would be nuanced according to the company’s ability to respond.

“It cannot be one size fits all. We have very large institutions that are well-resourced and have been working on these issues for some time and participating in the standard-settings.”

The regulator has also moved to active supervision and enforcement after developing obligations for marketing appropriate products to investors.

And as the government weighs the tightening of regulation around the buy now, pay later sector, Mr Longo said ASIC was reviewing product governance arrangements in the small amount credit sector.

“We’re looking at how target market determinations were developed, including the data, metrics and other key considerations that underpinned these important public documents,” he said.

Mr Longo said investors do not fully understand the significant risks inherent in crypto investments, lured in by slick marketing and the promise of high returns.

“It’s going to be very hard to regulate. To my mind, this is a highly risky, highly volatile activity, and you should be really careful before you [invest in] it.”"

Twitter CFO Ned Segal warned employees Friday their bonuses could be half the maximum, per The NYT.

Segal said the company's bonus pool was at 50% of where it could be if financial targets were being hit, per The NYT.

Twitter employees' bonuses are tied to the company's financial performance, which has declined of late.

Twitter told employees Friday they're on course to get half their typical annual bonuses because of the company's financial challenges, The New York Times reported.

In an email to staff, Twitter CFO Ned Segal said the social-media company's bonus pool was currently at 50% of what it could be if financial targets were being hit, The NYT reported, citing as sources two employees who received the email.

Twitter didn't immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. The NYT said a Twitter spokesperson confirmed the email's veracity and declined to comment further.

Twitter's warning on bonuses comes as it tries to force Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to complete his proposed $44 billion acquisition of the social-media group — something Twitter highlighted in its second-quarter earnings report as having had a detrimental impact on its finances.

Twitter, Meta, Alphabet, and other platforms that rely at least in part on digital advertising for revenue are grappling with a downturn in the ad market amid fears of recession.

Twitter employees receive annual bonuses based on the company's financial performance, which could improve before they are ultimately paid out.

Twitter and Musk are at loggerheads over their proposed $44 billion deal, which has culminated in a fractious legal battle between the parties. Musk argues Twitter won't provide him with necessary detail about the volume of spam bots on its platform.

In its second-quarter earnings report, published July 22, Twitter said ""uncertainty"" over Musk's proposed takeover of the company, as well as advertising industry headwinds, contributed to its first quarterly revenue decline since 2020. Twitter reported a net second-quarter loss of $270 million compared with a net income of $66 million in the same quarter in 2021.

Financial comparison group Finder estimates 145,000 homeowners, or about five per cent of people with a mortgage, would be in this situation if interest rates went up by three percentage points.

Finder home loan expert Richard Whitten said more rate rises, to curb rising inflation, would force struggling borrowers to sell in a slowing housing market.

'After yet another cash rate increase, mortgage repayments for many borrowers are higher than they were a few months ago and likely to climb higher still this year,' he said.

'Through the rest of 2022, many homeowners on variable rates will start to struggle more, and we will likely see the number of defaults rise.'

Borrowers in May, June, July and August have already endured 1.75 percentage points of Reserve Bank rate increases, the steepest increases since 1994.

Australian home borrowers could be forced to sell their home if interest rates kept on rising - making it harder for them to pay off their loan, a new survey has found (pictured is a Melbourne auction)

The ANZ bank is expecting the cash rate, now at a six-year high of 1.85 per cent, to hit a 10-year high of 3.35 per cent by November, with larger 0.5 percentage point rate rises in September, October and on Melbourne Cup day.

This would mean borrowers would have copped 3.25 percentage points of rate increases in just six months, with the RBA in May ending the era of the record-low 0.1 per cent cash rate.

That prediction, should it materialise, would see a borrower with an average, $600,000 mortgage paying $1,060 more every month on their repayments compared with May.

This borrower would be owing $3,366 each month, compared with $2,306 in May.

The banks since November last year have been required to assess a borrower's ability to cope with a three percentage point rise in mortgage rates, under Australian Prudential Regulation Authority rules.

ANZ and Westpac are expecting the Reserve Bank to stop tightening monetary policy once the cash rate reached 3.35 per cent but the 30-day interbank futures market is expecting a 3.7 per cent cash rate by April 2023.

Financial comparison group Finder estimates 145,000 home owners, or about five per cent of people with a mortgage, would be in this situation if interest rates went up by three percentage points (pictured are houses in Melbourne)

The Finder survey of 308 Australians with a home loan found 48 per cent of them would have to cut back on spending while 14 per cent would struggle to pay their mortgage and bills.

The five per cent who feared they would have to sell their home was estimated to comprise 145,000 home borrowers.

Those in this situation would be forced to do so in a falling market putting them in a situation, known as negative equity, where a borrower owed more than their home was worth.

The Commonwealth Bank, Australia's biggest home lender, is expecting national home prices to fall by 15 per cent by 2023.

The banks are now much stricter on borrowers with a debt-to-income ratio of six or more, the level APRA deems to be risky.

Australians who borrow the maximum amount allowed are now being advised their have to forego having a credit card.

Credit ratings agency Moody's Investors Service said stricter rules were needed to reduce the risk of delinquencies, where a borrower is 30 days or more behind on their mortgage repayments.

'Stronger loan quality will mitigate heightened delinquency risks as interest rates and inflation rise,' it said.

Moody's said delinquency rates were likely to 'increase moderately over the rest of this year, because rising interest rates and higher cost of living pressures will weigh on borrowers’ capacities to repay debt'.

But the credit ratings agency calculated average delinquency rates of two to four per cent, over the past five years, for non-conforming loans, where borrowing criteria isn't as strict as the major banks.

Inflation in the year to June surged by 6.1 per cent, the fastest pace since 1990 when the one-off effect of the GST introduction in 2000 and 2001 was taken out.

238f97cd-076c-4128-bbc2-5612c351b07e,"DigitalX expects it will earn a yield of 4.5 per cent being a validator. The future return will depend on the number of validators and demand to use the network. (Ether is required to process actions on Ethereum, underpinning demand for the cryptocurrency.) Providing crypto for a return is known as “staking”.

New form of financial infrastructure

“Staking has been around for a long time, but moving from proof of work to proof of stake on Ethereum is a game changer,” Lisa Wade, a former NAB executive and now CEO of DigitalX, said.

“The merge has made it feasible for companies like ours to start to experiment with nodes that earn from providing a service, to provide a yield for our investors.

“This is a new form of financial infrastructure, and it is important to understand how it works and to contribute. If we want blockchain to bring all its benefits, including smart contracts, we need robust and cheap financial infrastructure to use.”

Last week, DigitalX, said it had sold 3.35 of its bitcoin to buy ether. It still holds 212.68 bitcoin, worth about $6.5 million, on its balance sheet, part of a $20 million portfolio of digital assets. DigitalX and Block are the only two ASX-listed companies with direct exposure to bitcoin.

DigitalX shares moved from 4¢ to 5¢ on the announcement last week; its market capitalisation is just shy of $40 million.

Ether has lost 55 per cent of its value this calendar year, but is up about 60 per cent off June lows and was trading at just over $2300 at the weekend.

Ms Wade said DigitalX started investigating opportunities to participate in validating Ethereum after she interviewed one of its co-founders, Joe Lubin, at a Blockchain Australia event last year, where he discussed the merge as reducing energy and web3 as the “early days of a paradigm shift”. Her realisation was “we can be part of a shift to green financial infrastructure”.

With the “crypto winter” this year burning many speculative investors, Ms Wade said yield-generating protocols in “decentralised finance” such as Aave and Compound have been proven out; DigitalX has started to invest in Aave. “When all the meltdowns happened, these mechanisms worked,” she said.

There are still many unknowns about the Ethereum merge. DigitalX’s team is determining whether it would be better to run multiple validator nodes each holding 32 ether or whether ether should be pooled into a large amount to lift the chance of being selected to choose new nodes.

“We are trying to do the maths on how do we get the highest yield by getting the most introducer roles,” she said. “We are testing the structure, and we think that will be good learnings for the market, and we will share that as soon as we know.”

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said through Twitter this month that the merge could happen about September 15.

It will help Ethereum compete with blockchain networks including Solana, Avalanche, Tron, Cardano and Algorand, who have become more popular as fees on Ethereum became too expensive, and the network struggled to meet rising demand before crypto markets crashed.

DigitalX last week sold some bitcoin to buy ether to allow it to earn yield by participating as a validator of the merged ethereum network. Chris Ratcliffe

If it had maintained a computer power-hungry “proof of work” mechanism, Ms Wade said, “Ethereum would have been disintermediated from all the proof of stake competitors given the reduced environmental impact is so impactful, along with the speed and the cost”.

The Ethereum merge will raise questions around future regulation, including whether ether would be classified as a security under United States laws, as opposed to a commodity. This would subject the exchanges that list it to tougher regulations.

Ms Wade said DigitalX assumes crypto would become heavily regulated as financial services laws, and “we are presuming a merged ethereum is a security”.

DigitalX is working with the Digital Finance Co-operative Research Centre, alongside the Reserve Bank, ANZ Bank and Macquarie, to develop opportunities relating to real-world asset “tokenisation’“

Ms Wade said institutional interest in crypto was rising despite the market meltdown this year, and she points to the announcement this month by BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, which said it was partnering with Coinbase to provide institutional clients of its Aladdin platform with direct access to crypto.

A lot of speculative money in crypto “has been severely burnt, but we are seeing institutions stepping into the space during this crash, and it is game changing”, she said. “You have to think about this as totally new financial infrastructure.”"
c135bd1e-aa35-484b-8fa4-953e0f49dd0c,"Justin Bons, the founder and CIO of Cyber Capital, reveals the biggest threat to Ethereum after the merge. He believes that investors, traders, and developers are standing at the crossroads of Ethereum.

He reveals a number of external factors that could affect Ethereum, including a potential sanction from the US government. The US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control recently sanctioned a virtual currency mixer, Tornado cash. There was speculation as to whether the OFAC could move against Ethereum as well.

However, according to Bons, the biggest threat to Ethereum come from within in the form of social slashing and unclear governance. He believes that Ethereum could be headed for multiple forks and a disaster.

Bons Spells Out The Danger

According to Justin Bons, Ethereum can fall into the trap of social slashing. He believes that social slashing can create similar censorship issues that it intended to fight. The merge changes Ethereum’s consensus mechanism from Proof-of-work to Proof-of-stake.

Proof-of-stake depends upon validators to verify transactions and them to the blockchain. The validators stake a specific amount of native token, which is slashed in case of dishonest behavior. For Ethereum, the amount staked is 32 ETH.

Justin believes that Ethereum’s PoS chain is censorship resistant. However, the community deciding to slash the staked Ethereum can be a big issue. He believes that slashing should be the nuclear option, only a measure of last resort. Otherwise, a lot of innocent people’s property rights could be abridged.

Progress On Ethereum Merge

The Ethereum 2.0 client Teku has released an important update that allows every mainnet user to prepare for the merge. A recent report also revealed that the Ethereum merge is 96% complete.

Ethereum developers also confirmed that the final date for the merge is September 15. However, the exact date for the merge rate will depend upon the hash rate. Ethereum needs to maintain the hash rate of at least 872.2 TH/s."
7a35d278-f02c-46fe-a2af-d345b0031fd8,"Ethereum.org, the official website of Ethereum, has updated 8 misconceptions about the Merge as the community awaits the anticipated upgrade on September 15. The Merge will not reduce gas fees, make transactions faster, or enable withdrawal of staked ETH.

These changes will happen with the subsequent completion of the Surge, Verge, Purge, and Splurge phases and the Shanghai upgrade.

Ethereum Clears 8 Misconceptions About Gas Fees, Transaction Speed, Staking After the Merge

Ethereum.org updated 8 misconceptions about the Merge on August 17 as the anticipated date of the upgrade draws near. Ethereum is a transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus with the merger of the Ethereum Mainnet and Beacon Chain. It will reduce power usage by 99%.

Users don’t need to upgrade software, transfer funds, or send ETH in order to move to proof-of-stake Ethereum. However, users need to be aware of scams during the Merge and misconceptions about the Merge.

Misconception 1: Merge Will Reduce Gas Fees

The Merge will change the consensus mechanism to PoS, but not expand network capacity or throughput to lower gas fees. In fact, the gas fee depends on the Ethereum network demand.

However, the transition to PoS will help focus on increasing scalability in the Surge phrase through sharding and rollups to significantly reduce gas fees.

Misconception 2: Merge Will Increase Transaction Speed

The transaction speed will not increase much as blocks will be produced only 10% faster on PoS than PoW. It introduces the transaction finality and epochs concepts.

advertisement

However, users can expect a faster transaction speed of 100,000 transactions per second after the completion of all phases of the Ethereum upgrade.

Misconception 3: Merge Will Enable Staked ETH Withdrawals

The Merge will not immediately enable withdrawal of staked ETH (stETH). The Shanghai upgrade will only enable staked ETH withdrawals. It means Ethereum assets will remain locked and illiquid during the waiting period of 6-12 months.

Misconception 4: Validators Will Not Receive Liquid ETH Rewards

Validators will have immediate fee rewards and maximal extractable value (MEV) earned during block proposals on the Ethereum Mainnet. On the Beacon Chain, the newly issued ETH will be locked until the Shanghai upgrade.

Misconception 5: All Stakers Will Exit At Once After Enabling Withdrawals

After the Shanghai upgrade, all validators will be incentivized to withdraw staked ETH or stake more using rewards. Moreover, validator exits are rate limited for security reasons that allow only 6 validators to exit per epoch or 6.4 minutes.

Misconception 6: Staking APR Will Triple After the Merge

The APR may only increase by nearly 50%, not 200%. The more fees paid by users will increase validators’ fee rewards.

Misconception 7: Running a node requires staking 32 ETH

Mining nodes under proof-of-work (PoW) and validator nodes under proof-of-stake (PoS) require economic resources to process a block. A non-block-producing node doesn’t require ETH, but a computer with 1-2 TB of available storage and an internet connection. These blocks help increase the security, privacy, and censorship resistance of the Ethereum protocol.

Misconception 8: Merge Will Result in Downtime of Ethereum Blockchain

The Merge will be triggered by the terminal total difficulty (TTD) to transition the Ethereum to PoS automatically. There is no downtime.

ETH Deflationary After the Upgrade

Ethereum will become a deflationary asset after the Merge as the supply deflates over time due to the EIP-1559 burning mechanism.

The ETH prices will likely increase due to demand under the right market conditions. According to Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum will gain demand 6-8 months after the Merge."
d7c3ddb4-3925-47b5-bf8b-3d7725293e48,"Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are currently leading the crypto markets out of the grip of the bears. Although met with a series of resistance along the way, the markets have rallied quite well so far. However, like all things, rallies come to an end, and the community is expecting this one to hit a pause soon. A notable analyst has, nonetheless, mentioned that the recent rally is likely to persist at this point.

Svenson thinks shorting the markets now is dangerous

Prominent analyst, Kevin Svenson, took to Twitter to warn the community against shorting the markets right now. Svenson came to this conclusion, taking into consideration the price movements of BTC and ETH as seen on two charts. “It seems like we’re going to break out,” Svenson said.

He highlighted a trend of “rapid movements” in both the Bitcoin and Ethereum 50 and 30-minute respective charts. Despite having gained by 33% since its scary drop mid-June, Svenson noted that BTC is currently “really low.” This should send the idea that the asset’s breakout has not yet priced in. Hence, the community should expect further surges.

Svenson mentioned that it is ill-advised to short the market when one’s EMAs indicate an uptrend.

Ethereum is outperforming Bitcoin

A fellow analyst, buttressing Svenson’s point, noted that he has been telling his followers something similar. He mentioned that short positions should only come when there is an indication of a reversal in the current momentum.

However, another analyst disagreed, adding that shorts at resistance levels are welcome. Svenson highlighted that he was referring to holding a short position, and that short scalping can actually work.

The momentum from the recent rally appears to have decelerated of late. The markets are currently witnessing a mild correction, but sentiments remain bullish regardless. As has been the case for some time now, ETH appears to be outperforming BTC.

From the derivatives markets, liquidations have occurred more on long BTC positions in the past 24 hours. However, the reverse is the case with ETH, with $29M in liquidations for short positions in the past 24 hours. Funding Rate on ETH derivatives also look more promising than BTC’s.

At the time of writing, BTC and ETH respectively trade at $23,761 and $1,876. They’ve both shed some minor gains in the past 24 hours."
e5b36443-1b96-47fe-baa8-69acc8dc3231,"Ethereum miners, specifically the ETHPOW group, have announced a liquidity pool freezing technology. ETHPOW is the group of Ethereum miners who have vowed to hardfork the chain after the merge.

In a Twitter announcement, they reveal that the use of liquidity pool freezing technology was to protect the users from hackers.

Liquidity Pool Freezing Plan Explained

On their Twitter account, the ETHPOW group reveal that they are going to freeze some lending protocol smart contracts. According to them, in the initial days after the fork, users’ ETHW tokens deposited in liquidity pools can be compromised. Pools like Uniswap, Aave, and Compound will have deposited ETHW tokens.

According to the group, these tokens can be swapped by hackers and scientists with valueless USDT, USDC and WBTC. Therefore the ETHW core is making the decision to freeze smart contracts of lending pools till those companies can come up with a better solution.

They have also revealed that the freeze will not be applied to staking contracts if they only deal with a single asset. The ETHW core has also recommended that users remove their tokens from liquidity pools like decentralized exchanges and lending platforms.

This move has drawn criticism from various influential figures in the crypto community. Foobar, a developer and blockchain auditor, has ridiculed the group by questioning their competence to successfully pull off this move.

Alberto Rosas, the CEO of Gamium Corp, has questioned the blockchain’s decentralization if a small group can make such big decisions. He believes that the ETHW chain will become a slow, centralized chain without any market value.

Is The Ethereum Hardfork Likely

The Ethereum merge will change Ethereum’s consensus mechanism from Proof-of-work to Proof-of-stake. This will reduce Ethereum’s energy consumption by more than 99%. However, it also replaces the miners currently required by the PoW system with validators.

As a result, the miners might shift to a PoW chain like Ethereum Classic, or hard fork the Ethereum blockchain. However, with a lot of pressure piling up against Ethereum hardfork, such a move will probably not gain traction."

Ethereum price analysis imprints a negative view for the day. The price sees a steady decline from the swing highs of $2,000 over the past four-session. It might be a much-anticipated correction or a trend reversal.

The current market structure favors the bearish sentiment. As of publication time, ETH/USD is exchanging hands at $1,830, down 2.46% for the day. The 24-hour trading volume rose more than 16% to $19.31 billion. A fall in price with a rise in volume is a bearish sign.

Ethereum price extends the decline for the fourth consecutive session.

The price took a shelter near the critical support zone of $1,850.

A daily candlestick above $1,900 would favor the bulls.

Ethereum price consolidates

On the daily time scale, the Ethereum price analysis indicates a neutral to negative bias.

Over the last few sessions, we are seeing rejection candles near the higher level, breaking previous days’ low on the daily basis. If that continues to happen, we can expect a sharp big bearish candle in the coming days.

On the weekly charts, the price faces resistance at the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Along with a 38.6% Fibonacci retracement, which will act as immediate resistance for this week.

If the price closes above recent highs of $2,032, then we can expect a good bullish momentum, otherwise, the market will slowly go down.

The nearest support for ETH could be found in the $1720 to $1750 zone. This is also a 20-Day EMA support level on the daily chart.

ETH on one hour chart is forming a “Head & Shoulder ” pattern. The neckline is at $1,865. If that level broke and gave a closing below this level on an hourly time frame, then we can expect a good fall of up to $1,750.

On the other hand, a shift in the bullish sentiment could induce fresh buying interest in the second largest cryptocurrency. In that case, a move above the $2,000 level could invalidate the bearish outlook. And the price can be higher than $2100.

f91694c8-c49c-4966-83dc-2de89b248e7c,"As one of the most anticipated events in the crypto space in recent times, there is bound to be rumors and misconceptions surrounding The Merge. Seeing as it goes live in a few weeks, Ethereum’s team has cleared up some of these fallacies in a new blog post.

Will the merge lower gas fees?

The Ethereum Mainnet will soon merge with the Beacon Chain proof-of-stake system marking the end of the current proof-of-work mechanism. This mechanism is energy-efficient, as a matter of fact, per the blog post, Ethereum’s energy consumption will be reduced by 99.5%

This doesn’t in any way cause a reduction in Ethereum’s gas fees as revealed by the team, ‘The Merge is a change of consensus mechanism, not an expansion of network capacity, and will not result in lower gas fees’. This is also probably the most widespread misconception.

Another statement the team deemed false is the “32 ETH is required to run a node”. According to them, running a node is not limited to a group of people and no amount of ETH is needed as such.

The post also clarifies the air on whether any historical or transactional data will be lost post merge. The answer to this is also no, as clarified by the team.

Other key things to note about the merge

There are other things to note from the extensive blog post and one of such is that, post merge, ‘transaction speed will mostly remain the same’. The merge doesn’t necessarily increase the network’s capacity and it’s only just a consensus mechanism.

Additionally, the merge upgrade will happen without any downtime as designed and there won’t be any loss of funds or static in the blockchain.

As for Validators, they will be rewarded with fee tips/MEV which will be deposited to a mainnet account and run by the validator immediately after the merge."

The Ethereum (ETH) price lost 0.236 Fibonacci retracement support with today’s price drop, indicating a minor correction. This breakdown increases the chances for the price to retest the $0.382 FIB level at $1600. However, a drop below the 0.382 FIB level will trigger a significant correction, and losing 0.5 FIB will reflect weakness in bullish momentum.

Key points from ETH analysis:

The daily-RSI slope nosedive below the neutral line

The bearish crossover of the 20 and 100-day EMA will bolster the ongoing correction

The intraday trading volume in Ethereum is $22.7 Billion, indicating a 42% gain

Source- Tradingview

Over the last month, ETH/USDT market value nearly doubled, outpacing Bitcoin’s gain. The altcoin’s north walk showed a steady breakout of higher resistance and formed a local top at $2000 psychological resistance.

Furthermore, on August 14th, the ETH price reverted from the $2000 resistance with an evening star pattern and triggered an occasional bull trend pullback. However, recent news that the US Fed may increase the interest rate by 0.75% ignites a sudden sell-off in the market.

As a result, the ETH price dropped 8% today and nosedive below the combined support of $1775, 20 EMA, and 100 EMA. Furthermore, a decisive breakdown from the mentioned support with increased volume activity indicates the current correction may extend longer.

Thus, a daily candlestick closing below the $1775 mark will flip this level into potential resistance. An expected retest may offer an entry opportunity for short sellers before the prices drop another 6.5% to retest the $0.382 Fibonacci retracement level at $1600.

If the selling pressure persists, the ETH price will breach this mentioned level and drop a 10% to hit the 50% retracement level.

Technical indicator-

EMAs: the 20-day EMA provided dynamic support to the ongoing recovery rally. However, a breakdown from this support bolsters the correction theory.

ETH retraces from the $1,900 mark following a period of consolidation after testing the crucial $2,000 mark on Saturday. But the formation of the small candlestick indicates the market is not favoring a reversal rather it could be taken as a healthy correction. Sidelined investors could enter near the lower levels to capitalize on the positive sentiment.

As of publication time, ETH/USD is trading at $1,877, down 1.13% for the day. The 24-hour trading volume has declined by 17.34%, totaling $15.88 billion according to CoinMarketCap data. A decline in price with receding volumes is a sign of weakening of downside momentum.

Ethereum price extends downside for the third straight day.

Crucial support near $1,850 is vital for bulls to sustain.

The momentum oscillator warns of aggressive bids.

Ethereum price enters into a consolidation phase

On the daily chart, the Ethereum price analysis implies an impeding correction provided some conditions are met.

The formation of the ‘Spinning top’ on Thursday followed by a series of red candlesticks promotes the current lower price action.

Currently, the price is held near the crucial support zone of $1,850-70, if the bulls failed to hold the level on the daily basis the gates will be open for further lower levels. Bulls need more buying participation in successfully flipping the support into the resistance zone.

A daily close below $1,850 could fall up to the 100-day exponential moving average at $1,759.

On the other hand, a spike in buying orders could push back into a higher trajectory. A candlestick above $1,900 could be a sign of the bulls gaining control.

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is currently bullish, as can be seen in the green color of the histogram. Moreover, the oscillator points at the preceding bullish momentum as expressed by the tops of the histogram.

With Merge, there could be a ripple effect on other cryptocurrencies as well. But there is widespread anticipation that the Ethereum (ETH) price could shoot up after the upgrade. The Merge is scheduled for around September 15 by the developers.

Ethereum Merge Impact On Other Cryptocurrencies

Meanwhile, it remains to be seen how Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies would react in the weeks leading to the upgrade. However, any chance of the Ethereum Merge going wrong or having a negative impact would be devastating for the ecosystem. The market has already suffered a tough year so far with back to back setbacks starting from Terra fallout.

Samson Mow, a Bitcoin supporter, feels the Ethereum developers are prioritizing tokenomics over strengthening the network. As a result of the Merge, Ethereum could land itself in the middle of regulatory action, he added. Mow further said the requirement to stake 32 ETH made proof of stake highly centralized. Ethereum validators would need to deposit 32 ETH to activate the software.

“Ethereum’s problems are caused by constantly optimizing for tokenomics over decentralization, security, and resilience. It looks like the Merge and POS will lead to complete regulatory capture by centralized exchanges and staking platforms, and there’s no way out for them.”

Downside Risk For Bitcoin From Merge?

A section of investors in the crypto community are worried about the Merge’s potential risk for the entire market. The Merge has huge downside risk for digital assets yet everyone is bulled up, said one Foss on Twitter. He feels so due to Ethereum’s trading correlation with BTC. So far, Ethereum showed positive momentum with the recent price hike despite headwinds. The Ethereum Merge progress is 96.55% complete, as per OKLink data. Going by the current hashrate, the Merge is expected to most likely happen around September 15.

As of writing, Ethereum is trading at $1,704.02, down 0.86% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. In the last one week, Ethereum dropped 8.61% after a recent reach to the $2,000 mark.

760188d0-7bc9-4e9b-ba3a-881a3b491729,"The new chief executive of embattled listed fund manager Magellan has acknowledged the firm has work to do to regain client trust and restore its reputation after it reported a slip in profits and its funds under management slumped by almost half in the space of a year.

“Our clients have a choice about who manages their money and over the last 12 months, it’s clear that the events have impacted our clients’ confidence in us,” said David George, who was appointed to the role in May.

He made his comments after Magellan on Wednesday revealed its founder Hamish Douglass, who left the company after an extended period of medical leave, received more than $8 million in remuneration in the last financial year, including almost $2.5 million in termination benefits.

Magellan chief executive David George said he was focused on getting his feet under the desk and talking to staff during his first few weeks in the job.

The firm announced in June that Douglass, who was its star stock picker since he co-founded the company in 2006, had resigned and would be a consultant for the company starting in October."
8c9d7cfe-da5d-4033-878f-f55c96050f6e,"As George himself alluded, the problem at Magellan is simple enough to diagnose: bad investment performance.

The global fund’s returns had not been up to scratch, and amid management chaos, investors lost faith and pulled their money out. If Magellan could improve its returns, that would stem the outflows and in time attract funds again, he said.

Easy to say, hard to do

A strategy to fix performance is harder than it sounds. Beating the market is a perennial challenge that even the smartest and best-resourced investors fail to achieve consistently.

That’s especially the case in the highly efficient world of large caps where Magellan hunts.

The edge that George brings is his experience looking under the hood of a thousand or so of the best funds management businesses in the world.

If he can bring some of that insight to Magellan and implement it, there’s a shot at restoring its performance. But, as the firm’s beleaguered investors have found out, investment managers are delicate personality-led operations. There aren’t many examples where an underperforming fund has been retrofitted for success.

Conversely, a strategy to reduce management and performance fees is easier than it sounds, but trickier to sell.

A legion of short-sellers profited from Magellan’s dramatic decline last year by betting that not only would its underperformance catch up with the share price, so too would its relatively high fees.

George’s position for now is that Magellan’s fees are fair, and there is no plan to reduce them. But he knows that without better performance, that will be tough to maintain.

That’s especially true as lower-cost competitors with better numbers such as GQG Partners make their presence known; GQG reported average base management fees of 47.6 basis points compared to Magellan’s 65 basis points.

For now, brokers are downgrading their forecasts.

This does not imply that George is not up to the challenge, or doesn’t have a clear executable strategy to transform Magellan.

One analyst argued that McDonald’s (famously a core Magellan holding) turned its business around by realising it wasn’t the burgers that gave it an edge. It was the distribution, scale and reach that made the golden arches valuable.

Since Magellan opened its doors, global funds have become as commoditised as hamburgers. Distribution has been Magellan’s undeniable strength, and it is somewhat ironic that its assets are now more evenly split among Australian equities, infrastructure and global equities.

In effect, it has shrunk into a multi-boutique.

George expressed his enthusiasm for Magellan’s lower-cost quasi-passive strategies, marketed as Core, for those that baulk at its fees. The Core offerings have divided analysts, some of whom regard it as a tacit concession about the value of its strictly active offerings.

Counterintuitively, the Future Fund is among the biggest believers in the value of active managers.

Although it takes a dim view on paying long-only active fees, it’s prepared to pay for hedge funds, private equity and real asset managers on the evidence of skill. Magellan may consider exploiting George’s knowledge of less commoditised offerings.

It is a long road ahead for George. If he can get Magellan into a position where its funds can demonstrate reliable value for money – to the point where his old shop considers an investment – that would be truly impressive."

But what George did say suggested that his vision is pretty simple, really: step one, two and three is to lift the performance of Magellan’s flagship global equity strategy, which currently trails its benchmark over one, three and five years.

Magellan chief executive David George says the current macro environment makes it a good time to be an active manager.

This underperformance drove a 46 per cent drop in funds under management over the 2022 financial year to $61 billion and an 11 per cent decline in funds management profit. Magellan’s stock fell 8.5 per cent Wednesday on those numbers and is now down 66 per cent in the last 12 months.

George was understandably less specific on how he plans to lift the global fund’s performance.

The key message was that Magellan’s people and research capability is high quality, but that needs to convert to better investment calls and better risk management."
217da645-8bcc-47db-b71b-3264f77e7feb,"But that figure was at odds with a nightmare year for Magellan as its funds under management almost halved from $117 billion to $60 billion, forcing a sharp revision of future earnings.

Those outflows were a result of persistent underperformance of its main global funds, as well as the turmoil and ultimate departure of co-founder and chief investment officer Hamish Douglass.

Shares in Magellan slid 5 per cent to $14.25, demonstrating the extent of the challenge facing Mr George as analysts questioned the path ahead, the outlook for fund flows and the potential for fee pressures if its funds failed to turn their performance around.

The poor share price reaction was due, traders said, to lower than expected fee margins despite the bulk of the $50 billion of investor redemptions being from institutions that pay lower fees. However, chief financial officer Kirstin Morton later explained that average base management fees would increase to 65 basis points.

“The lack of further capital management initiatives, alongside commentary that MFG may reinvest in the business, could be poorly received,” Credit Suisse analysts told clients.

Morgan Stanley analysts said the July outflows of $2.5 billion suggested there was still downside risk to earnings, and with investment performance still soft “a turnaround will take time”.

Mr George said the firm had reviewed the fees it charges to institutions, but he said he believed Magellan’s rates to be competitive. “My view on fees is that they go to value,” he said.

“So I am much more concerned about ensuring Magellan can create market-leading performance, and getting us to the point where we’re doing that consistently,” Mr George said.

Magellan co-founder and portfolio manager Chris Mackay backed Mr George to restore the performance of the global funds, which have lagged the global benchmark over one, three and five-year periods.

“We know that performance has to improve, and for performance to improve in a sustained manner, process has to improve. David is right across that,” Mr Mackay said.

Magellan declared a dividend of 68.9¢ per share for the six months to June 30 and 179¢ for the full year – that’s 15 per cent lower than the 224¢ in interim, final and performance dividends paid to shareholders in 2021.

Two priorities

Mr George, who joined the firm from the Future Fund, where he was deputy chief investment officer, formally assumed the role a few weeks ago.

Magellan chair Hamish McLennan said Mr George had a “whole-of-market view”.

It followed a near-wholesale change to the company’s management ranks after the departure of Mr Douglass and chief executive Brett Cairns before that.

“Magellan’s commitment to deep research is still there,” Mr McLennan told The Australian Financial Review.

“But we are moving from being a founder-led organisation to one that has a fully independent board. It is a new phase in the life of the company.”

Mr George said he had two priorities – to work with the investment team and to seek feedback from staff and stakeholders at the firm.

“In my career, I’ve had the opportunity to see one thousand investment managers, investment processes and investment cultures in practice. I have a good perspective on what good looks like.”

Mr George added he would “share his thoughts in October”, which means investors will have to speculate until then about any major strategic initiatives.

Before Mr George’s appointment, Magellan told investors it would make no further principal investments in its Magellan Capital Partners unit.

It subsequently divested its 11.6 per cent holding in Mexican fast food chain Guzman y Gomez, netting $140 million. Magellan remains a 16 per cent shareholder of Finclear and has a 36 per cent economic interest in investment bank Barrenjoey.

Magellan said Barrenjoey delivered a “modest profit for the year” while the overall contribution from MCP was $8.4 million.

Mr McLennan and Mr George sought to emphasise that even as Magellan shed $60 billion of assets, it remained large, globally significant and financially strong.

“The strength of Magellan’s balance sheet provides us with significant headroom to invest in our business to deliver for our clients and position ourselves for future growth,” Mr George said.

While the Future Fund took a dim view of active equities managers, replacing all Australian and global mandates with low-cost passive and factor-based strategies, Mr George backed the resources and abilities of Magellan.

“The end of monetary expansion marks a change from the time when money flows pushed all asset values upward,” he told shareholders.

“Such a volatile and difficult environment should reward outstanding fundamental company research and active management of portfolios, qualities that are trademarks of Magellan products.”

He expressed excitement about Magellan’s lower-cost fund offerings, branded the Core Series, targeted at more fee-conscious investors, which he said had “tremendous potential”.

“It’s an access point for Magellan [that] has research capability that involves a little bit less active management, and a different price point, which can have quite a broad appeal to clients we don’t currently have on our roster.”

Magellan’s shares have fallen 30 per cent so far this calendar year and are 70 per cent lower over 12 months as both retail and institutional investors pulled money from its main global funds. Assets under management almost halved from $117 billion to $60.2 billion.

The shares have since rallied 35 per cent from a 52-week low of $11.10 hit on June 14."
dd7e1017-fa34-463b-9146-d5667ebcf8d8,"Barrenjoey’s real estate team has lost a pair of junior real estate bankers, as it goes through its first full bonus season.

Senior banker Rob Stanton, who specialises in real estate deals, left JPMorgan for Barrenjoey in 2020.

Edmund Zhang and Sai Naicker both left Barrenjoey this week, sources told Street Talk, after bonus payments hit bank accounts.

Both worked for the real estate team’s star banker Rob Stanton, who joined Barrenjoey from JPMorgan in 2020 as the new firm’s recruitment drive hit top speed.

Barrenjoey staff learnt about their bonuses a few weeks ago, and payments landed this week, sources said.

The freshly-minted bank has snagged some big investment banking roles in the past year - advising Suncorp Bank on its $4.9 billion sale to ANZ, helping KKR & Co into Ramsay Health Care - but it has also faced some challenges with announced M & A and equity capital markets activity slowing down in 2022.

The bonuses were said to have been skewed towards more junior staff, with senior staff that own equity told to think about the increase in their shareholdings over the longer-term.

Barrenjoey, founded in 2020, has seen a handful of senior exits in its short life. The group is 36 per cent owned by Magellan Financial Group, whose value has slid nearly 70 per cent over the last 12 months amid leadership and performance troubles. On handing down its FY22 results on Wednesday, Magellan said Barrenjoey delivered “a modest profit for the year”."

It means Thoma Bravo hasn’t found any major skeletons in Nearmap’s closet after spending more than a month inside, despite a short seller report and a lawsuit with a US rival that have spooked listed equities investors in recent years.

Street Talk wouldn’t be surprised if Thoma’s crew had well-thumbed and marked-up copies of J Capital’s report and rival EagleView’s legal claims tucked under their arms as they worked their way through Nearmap’s data room.

J Cap’s alleged Nearmap’s roof reports could be infringing on EagleView patents, and EagleView has brought litigation. Nearmap denies it all.

EagleView’s original complaint filed last year claims eight patents related to aerial mapping technology have been infringed upon, and it is seeking unspecified damages. As things stand now, the timeline for the case stretches into 2023, based on the latest scheduling orders. Discovery’s yet to be completed and it’s safe to say, it’s a hard slog ahead for Nearmap.

Thoma’ waltzing in when it knows all of that has Nearmap investors wondering if the PE firm has weighed the potential fallout from the legal claims and deemed them small enough to take on.

Then there’s also the fact that a take-private would remove Nearmap from the volatility of listed markets from the case’s announcements. Under a PE owner, the company could breathe easy as the legal case plays out.

Lastly, Thoma’s approach (and Nearmap’s discretion and disclosure) has bankers and boards taking notes on how to lob bids for beaten-down stocks and win due diligence.

Having sat quietly on the confidential, non-binding and indicative offer and shored-up Thoma Bravo’s interest, Nearmap only disclosed the bid at the final hurdle."

The strategy has had analysts run the numbers on Cleanaway’s funding options, while the company has also been in the market for a sizeable commercial and industrial waste acquisition.

The company’s had no trouble attracting attention from sell-side analysts, with the market well aware that Schubert is keen to drive the business forward and may need an equity injection to do so.

Cleanaway last raised equity in 2017, when it picked up $590 million in an entitlement offer via Macquarie Capital. On that occasion, it was raising to acquire Tox Free Solutions under former boss Vik Bansal.

The preparations come as Cleanaway was also due to hand down its results for the year to June 30. Analysts expect it to report $2.76 billion in revenue and $572.2 million in EBITDA, according to S & P Global Market Intelligence, which would be a record result on both counts.

Cleanaway shares closed at $2.71 on Thursday, to value the group’s equity at $5.6 billion. The stock was trading at 11.5-times forecast EBITDA.

Cleanaway could raise $350 million via an institutional placement or rights issue. However, given the relatively small raising size as a proportion of its market capitalisation, investors reckon it would be more likely to go down the placement plus share purchase plan route.

A spokesman declined to comment on Thursday night."

GenesisCare will review its property assets in a bid to find ways to free up capital.

Sources close to the company said GenesisCare was reviewing its minority venture capital investments and property assets – both logical places to start when trying to free up capital – and was likely to appoint advisers to test buyer appetite in the near term.

The company had property, plant and equipment worth $661 million on its balance sheet as at June 30 last year, and equity accounted investments worth $30 million.

It is understood FrontYa is talking to strategics and potential advisers ahead of raising that is slated to be worth more than $25 million and include both equity and debt components.

FrontYa has told potential investors the vast majority of funds raised would be used to increase deployments.

The group, founded less than one year ago, has settled on four properties and has 20-plus approvals for aspiring home-owners on its books, which it told potential investors was proof its concept worked and there was appetite for the product.

Its Series A raising comes hot on the heels of a pre-seed funding round, finalised in March, which saw the group pick up venture capital investor Rob Lederer, of Primo fame, and ex-CVC executive chairman Brett Sutton as investors. [Sutton formerly ran Affinity Equity Partners in Australia, which owned the Lederers’ Primo. Rob Lederer was Primo group GM].

FrontYa was founded last year by entrepreneur Nir Golan, wife Barbie, and data scientist Robbie Baskin, as a potential solution to the immense challenge first home buyers have in saving a deposit. FrontYa will co-invest with property buyers and double their contribution of up to $250,000.

Shares in CSL fell on Wednesday after the biotech giant reported a 5 per cent drop in net profit to $US2.25 billion ($3.2 billion) for the year to June 30. Sales of its blood plasma products were hit by lower blood collection volumes during the pandemic, the company said.

But CSL said it was confident it can return to growth, with profits expected in the range of $US2.4 billion to $US2.5 billion for the current financial year.

1c5176f4-0868-4cbb-a3fa-59e4d9b3ac23,"Because of the manufacturing lead times involved in these products, weak blood collections in 2021 weighed on immunoglobulin revenue in 2022, which fell 3 per cent. But the blood is flowing again – plasma collections rose 24 per cent across the 2022 year, with the June half seeing a particularly strong rebound – and Perreault is feeling confident.

“The headline is: CSL is returning to strong and sustainable growth,” he says. “Our CSL team has never been stronger or more unified across the organisation. Secondly, CSL has never been better positioned for sustainable growth. And finally, I don’t believe that CSL’s future has ever been brighter.”

Guidance for next year sees net profit growing by more than 9 per cent on a constant currency basis. This was a touch below market forecasts, which may have contributed to the stock slipping 3 per cent on Wednesday morning.

Inflation pressures not all bad

Perreault, who is based in Utah, says the impact of 9 per cent inflation on the US economy is visible everywhere he goes, including in CSL’s blood business.

The cost of plasma donations remains elevated. Wages are up between 8 and 10 per cent, COVID-19 variants are keeping absentee rates high, logistics costs are up and donation pricing remains extremely competitive because blood stocks are still suppressed coming out of the pandemic.

But ironically, inflation works in CSL’s favour too, as households look to supplement their income to offset higher living costs. “People are looking … to do other things to put a bit more cash in their pocket,” Perreault explains.

The demand picture for many of CSL’s products are also improving as the pandemic impact fades. As COVID-19 hospitalisations decrease, beds are being freed up for other medical procedures that require CSL blood products. And as patients get more confident about getting out and about, they are having more discussions with doctors that lead to the diagnosis of the rare and complex health issues that CSL specialises in.

“We’re seeing more infections, more people returning to the doctor, and we will see more diagnosis,” Perreault says. “The underlying demand was always there for these products. It’s just been kind of hidden by the fact that people haven’t had access to get diagnosed.”

If revenue and profit were down at CSL in 2022, one area of very strong growth was R & D spending, which leapt 17 per cent, or 11.2 per cent of revenue. Perreault is unapologetic about keeping the hammer down on R & D even in a softer year for the business.

“We can’t progress a sustainable growth strategy without investment in R & D. If we’re not innovating, we’re managing our exit from the business.”

The fruits of previous R & D can be seen in other parts of the business. CSL’s flu vaccine division Seqirus had an impressive year, with revenue and profit up 15 per cent and 16 per cent respectively. And Perreault is excited about positive results for a new treatment called garadacimab, which will be used to treat a blood disease called hereditary angioedema.

Perreault has also finally got his hands on Vifor, the Swiss pharmaceutical giant CSL bought last year for $US11.7 billion in a deal finally approved earlier this month.

While M & A deals have been few and far between for CSL, the market is excited about the prospects here and there is much anticipation ahead of a briefing on the business from Perreault in October.

But Perreault provided this column with an early look at the playbook for the deal. Vifor has an attractive product set that it’s grown through partnerships and acquisitions and Perreault says he will focus less on the business’s next phase of growth and more about commercialising what Vifor already has. For example, it sells in 20 countries compared to 102 for CSL.

Perreault says CSL was in a similar position a decade ago - lots of great products “but undercooked on commercialisation”."

With consumer price index inflation at a 32-year high of 7.3 per cent, the RBNZ has no choice but to lift the official cash rate.

Just as in Australia, the RBNZ's target band for inflation is one to three per cent.

The RBNZ has now raised rates from an emergency low of 0.25 per cent last October, including an unprecedented run of four 50 basis point hikes at the last four meetings.

""Core consumer price inflation remains too high and labour resources remain scarce,"" Governor Adrian Orr lamented.

""We are adamant that we're in a very strong position to be on top of inflation.

""A bit more work to do, but we're confident.""

Some New Zealand banks predicted the shock-and-awe option of a 75 basis point hike, but Mr Orr said it wasn't considered.

The RBNZ has published a worsening set of forecasts in its August Monetary Policy Statement, believing the OCR will peak at 4.1 per cent in March 2023.

While the bank predicts inflation will now begin to subside, Mr Orr said a gloomy international outlook would keep it above the target band until ""the middle of 2024"".

The projections see a 15 per cent loss in house prices from their peak in December 2021 before the rebound begins mid-way though 2023.

Mr Orr said he was aware the interest rate rises would cause pain for homeowners, who needed to ""sit it out"".

""Inflation really is a thief in the pocket,"" he said.

""We aren't heartless.

""The interest rate levels we're looking at at the moment are survivable but will mean for recent buyers some belt tightening.""

Mr Orr cited dampening prospects for growth and upward pressures on commodity prices due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in the RBNZ's judgement.

The bank has also predicted a higher unemployment rate than its previous forecasts - though still low by historical standards.

Currently at a basement 3.3 per cent, the jobless rate is tipped to rise to 4.5 per cent by the end of next year, topping out at five per cent in 2025.

There is some good news in the new forecasts, including an economic bounceback that will see New Zealand avoid recession.

The RBNZ has tipped 1.8 per cent growth in the second quarter this year after a surprise 0.2 per cent contraction in the first quarter."
