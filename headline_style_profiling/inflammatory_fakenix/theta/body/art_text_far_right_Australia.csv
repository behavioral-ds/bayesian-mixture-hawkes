The man, aged between 25 and 35, was working out at Snap Fitness in Spring Hill, Brisbane, Australia at 5:47 am on Thursday when he got into trouble.

Firefighters did not arrive until 6:20 am to rescue him, with paramedics arriving shortly afterward. It took six minutes to extract the man from under the weights.

By this point, the man was unconscious and required CPR.

He was taken to Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital in critical condition.

There were no staff at the 24-hour gym at the time and the man had to be helped by bystanders.

“His injury happened while doing a seated overhead press in a Smith machine,” a gym member wrote online.

“Didn’t seem life-threatening to begin with, although serious enough to call an ambulance.

“But it took about 10 to 15 minutes for it to get really serious, that is ‘he-is-now-unconscious-start-CPR-now’ serious.”

Smith machines are designed to allow gym-goers to lift barbells without a spotter.

Snap Fitness is open all hours every day, but there are only staff on site between 10 am and 7 pm Monday to Thursday, and 9 am to 2 pm on Fridays.

Queensland Police said the incident was “not a criminal matter”."

Last month, the Duchess of Sussex took a swipe at the controversial psychologist on her Spotify series “Archetypes” over his use of the word “crazy.”

The former “Suits” actress featured an audio clip of the self-help author saying: “I don’t think that men can control crazy women.”

During an interview with “Piers Morgan Uncensored,” Peterson was asked how he felt about appearing on the duchess’s podcast as a “villain.”

“Her voice drips with the same falsehood that the voice of Kamala Harris drips with,” he told the Sky News host.

“It’s this sanctimonious, faux compassionate, talking down to her audience.”

While appearing to impersonate the royal, Peterson drew laughs from Morgan as he continued: “Trying to be sure that we’re all really on the same compassionate page here and we’re all being victimized by terrible forces that are arrayed against us and none of that’s really fair.”

“It just grates on me,” he said.

“And I do believe that it is the case that it’s very difficult to control female anti-social behavior often of the type that’s been pilloried as hysterical and I think that there is no shortage of clinical evidence to support precisely that claim.

“It’s very difficult for women to control female anti-social behavior and females who are anti-social that feminine pattern is reputation salvaging under the guise of compassionate care and it’s extraordinarily destructive, so I stand by my words.”

This is not the first time Peterson has been criticized.

Back in September, actress Olivia Wilde made comments about the psychologist.

Speaking with Interview Magazine about her latest film, “Don’t Worry Darling,” the filmmaker explained the character Frank played by Chris Pine was based on the Canadian author.

“We based that character on this insane man, Jordan Peterson, who is this pseudo-intellectual hero to the incel community,” she told the outlet.

The star explained that incels are “disenfranchised, mostly white men who believe they are entitled to sex from women.”

“This guy Jordan Peterson is someone that legitimizes certain aspects of [the incel] movement because he’s a former professor, he’s an author, he wears a suit, so they feel like this is a real philosophy that should be taken seriously.”

Peterson broke down in tears during an interview with “Piers Morgan Uncensored” after discussing Wilde’s comments.

“This insane man, this pseudo-intellectual hero to the incel community, incel being these weirdo loner men who are despicable in many ways. Is that you? Are you the intellectual hero to these people?,” the broadcaster asked.

“Sure, why not. People have been after me for a long time because I have been speaking to young men, what a terrible thing to do,” Peterson replied.

It was at that point that the controversial commentator broke down in tears.

“I thought the marginalized were supposed to have a voice?,” he said."

Meghan Markle’s voice ""drips"" with ""falsehood"", according to psychologist Jordan Peterson, who has been interviewed after appearing in a soundbite during her podcast. Dr Peterson’s voice appeared in an episode discussing the use of labels such as “crazy”, “hysterical” or “nuts” in reference to women.

After introducing the topic, the Duchess, 41, switches to a clip of Dr Peterson, 60, saying: “I don't think that men can control crazy women.”

The Canadian was asked about this during an interview with Piers Morgan Uncensored on Talk TV.

In response to being involved in the episode of Archetypes on Spotify, which Morgan describes as playing a “villain” role, Dr Peterson shared his opinion of Meghan. He said: “Her voice drips with the same falsehood that the voice of Kamala Harris drips with.

He then drew laughs from Piers Morgan imitating the Duchess, his own voice high-pitched in tone."
5da8b671-8d1b-4c96-8996-286536e93dba,"As the midterm results rolled in Tuesday night, and the ""red wave"" long hoped for by Republicans had not materialized, many pundits and journalists across the spectrum pointed their fingers at former President Trump.

As several Trump-backed candidates in major races lost or lagged behind other Republicans in their states, a consensus appeared to emerge that Trump had a bad night, although it was still up in the air whether Republicans would re-capture the House and Senate.

Former Obama campaign strategist David Plouffe said on MSNBC, ""I think you have to say Donald Trump has now presided over two disastrous midterm elections."" In his only one as president in 2018, Trump's party lost control of the House, although it gained U.S. Senate seats thanks in part to a favorable map. In 2022, Republicans appeared poised to make huge gains and seize control of both chambers of Congress, but in the early hours of Wednesday morning, it still remained unclear if they would even take control of the House, a seemingly unthinkable proposition last week.

""Given the history of presidents in power, Democrats controlling all of Washington, inflation, this should’ve been a much stronger night for Republicans,"" Plouffe said. ""A bunch of reasons for that. But at the top of them is Donald Trump. He’s deeply unpopular, he supported a bunch of horrible Senate candidates who may end up coughing up the football here.""

2022 MIDTERM ELECTIONS: LIVE UPDATES

MSNBC's Chris Hayes said Republicans ascribed to Trump a ""totemic power he does not have"" and he had ""screwed"" his own party.

""He is unpopular. He is unpopular,"" Hayes said. ""He screwed you today. Screwed you. It's not the full story… but it is part of the story, and the sooner you dump him, the better it is for the Republican Party and American democracy, full stop.""

ABC's Jonathan Karl said it was still unclear who would control the chambers of Congress for the next two years, but declared Trump the goat.

""What I can tell you is the biggest loser tonight is Donald Trump,"" Karl said.

On CNN, conservative commentator Scott Jennings offered a rather blunt analysis of the night, juxtaposing the performance of Trump-backed candidates across the country with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, R., a potential 2024 contender who romped to a landslide re-election on Tuesday.

""There's a potential narrative out of this night that if you're a discerning Republican voter trying to figure out the future, direction of this party, we once again learn that Trump is not a national winner for the Republicans,"" the GOP pundit told the panel. ""But DeSantis may be the next evolution of someone who can marry what you like about Trump but also recover some people that went away from the party during Trump.""

TWITTER USERS MOCK MSNBC ANALYST FOR CASTING DOUBTS ON GEORGIA ELECTION: ‘DENIALISM, MAN’

In Georgia, Herschel Walker looked like he would not outright defeat Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., on Tuesday, despite Gov. Brian Kemp, R., already easily beating Democrat Stacey Abrams in his re-election bid. Trump enthusiastically backed Walker while he famously feuded with Kemp over his 2020 election defeat in Georgia.

Trump-supported Doug Mastriano was dispatched handily by Pennsylvania Democrat Josh Shapiro in the state's governor's race, and Dr. Mehmet Oz, another Trump candidate, lost to Democrat John Fetterman in Pennsylvania's closely watched Senate race.

Republicans also lost the New Hampshire Senate race with Don Bolduc unable to oust Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., and prominent Trump supporters in the House, like Rep. Mayra Flores, R-Texas, were defeated on Tuesday.

In one bright spot for Trump, Republican JD Vance defeated Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, in Ohio's Senate race. Trump supporters touted the party's wins in Florida and Ohio, formerly swing states Trump won in both 2016 and 2020, as proof he helped make them into red states.

JEN PSAKI ROASTED FOR CLAIMING SPANISH LANGUAGE ‘DISINFORMATION’ HELPED GOP IN FLORIDA

However, Jennings said DeSantis should tout his 20-point victory as a ""way to a national majority.""

""Boy, if I were Ron DeSantis, or someone who wanted to help her understand this, that is the message I would be on tomorrow, which is ‘My way is the way to a national majority. His way is the way to a national minority,'"" Jennings said.

MSNBC's Jen Psaki, formerly of the Biden White House, said Republicans ""have a [T]rump problem,"" while The Atlantic's Tim Alberta said DeSantis should not let Trump ""bluff him out of running for president"" and should be considered a favorite to win the nomination in 2024.

Various conservative voices also cast blame on Trump as the results came in and fumed over the poor showing for Republicans.

Trump himself commented about tonight's results, declaring it a ""great evening"" and claimed the news media was trying to downplay it.

""174 wins and 9 losses, A GREAT EVENING, and the Fake News Media, together with their partner in crime, the Democrats, are doing everything possible to play it down. Amazing job by some really fantastic candidates!"" Trump posted on his social media site Truth Social."
5ddc1c89-2bff-4def-89e8-d789d610aaf7,"After a confusing night of contradictory election information, the battle for control of Congress wasn’t settled when the sun came up.

Everyone in the media was bracing for the red wave that was going to carry Republicans to victory, but it turned out to be a slow tide. It’s still possible that the GOP will wind up controlling both houses of Congress, but only narrowly.

The upset of the night had to be John Fetterman beating Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania, despite his disastrous debate, as Democratic voters decided to rally behind the recovering stroke victim. That flip of a Senate seat balanced J.D. Vance beating Tim Ryan in Ohio, leaving control of the chamber undecided.

A Republican takeover of the House remains very likely, but Kevin McCarthy may not have the 30-seat margin that many had predicted, raising questions about the polling and the punditry. It’s clear that having finally accepted the notion of a Democratic drubbing in the final weeks of the campaign, the media may have missed a more competitive election than everyone expected.

AOC AND THE ‘SQUAD’ SET TO WELCOME NEW MEMBERS AFTER PROGRESSIVE WINS IN MULTIPLE STATES

What follows is a timeline of one crazy night of cable news coverage.

It was a whole lot of ""too early to call"" in the early hours. That’s hardly surprising, especially in the key Senate races, where the Real Clear Politics average had most of them within one percentage point or sometimes as tight as 0.4 percent.

But the blizzard of raw vote totals was hard to follow and highly misleading, with 7 or 8 percent of precincts reporting. It all depended on which parts of which state were reporting.

So in the crucial Georgia race, Sen. Raphael Warnock was ""ahead"" with 74 percent of the vote to 24 percent for Herschel Walker. Stacey Abrams, who would go on to lose for governor, was also leading incumbent Brian Kemp. So these figures were beyond meaningless.

Further complicating the coverage, with record early voting, was how and when mail-in ballots were counted. In Pennsylvania, for instance, the state is required to count mail-in ballots only after the same-day results are reported. That would mean the Democratic-leaning mail ballots will come in much later, boosting Fetterman. But there would be nothing suspicious about that.

POTENTIAL RED WAVE TURNS INTO TRICKLE IN DISAPPOINTING MIDTERM ELECTIONS FOR REPUBLICANS

It was eye-glazing at times, as the anchors and commentators kept cautioning viewers not to put much stock in the blur of numbers on their magic walls.

While virtually everyone expected a GOP takeover of the House–even President Biden told reporters the House would be ""tough""--the cable networks had to go district by district to confirm that Republicans had taken control with 218 seats.

At 8 p.m. eastern, it was another round of ""too early to call."" Too early in the Pennsylvania Senate race. Too early to say whether New Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan could hang on against Republican retired military man Don Bolduc.

Still too early to call in Georgia, where there could be a runoff if Walker or Warnock doesn’t get over 50 percent.

Only the blowout races warranted projections, including Ron DeSantis, who cruised to a landslide victory over Charlie Crist in Florida, and Marco Rubio, as well as Sarah Huckabee Sanders in Arkansas.

The pattern continued at 9. Too early to call the race between Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Republican challenger Blake Masters. Same with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Too early! Too early! Too early! It was repeated like a mantra.

I’ve never seen an election night where so much effort was spent explaining things away. This doesn’t mean anything because the same-day vote hasn’t come in. That doesn’t mean anything because these Republican strongholds haven’t come in. This doesn’t mean anything because it’s too lopsided. Don’t believe your eyes. It was like a hall of mirrors.

NEVADA GOP REP. MARK AMODEI SWEEPS DEMOCRATIC CHALLENGER FOR 7TH TERM

At 10, when the polls closed in Nevada, it was–repeat after me–too early to call. That state’s Senate race offered Republicans perhaps their best shot at a takeaway, with Republican Adam Laxalt taking on Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto. In Georgia, Walker had taken the lead over Warnock, 49.6 to 48.5 percent, despite plenty of doomsaying about how he was running behind Gov. Kemp. So there were all these nail-biters, now dubbed ""too close to call.""

Perhaps that’s why the New York Times published tips for people (meaning Democrats) to stay calm, such as ""breathe like a baby"" and ""plunge your face into a bowl with ice water.""

When NBC projected that Maggie Hassan would hold onto her Senate seat in New Hampshire, Democrats breathed a sigh of relief.

With embattled Democrats holding onto key House districts, such as Abigail Spanberger in Virginia, there was growing talk–especially on MSNBC, but on the other channels as well–that a red wave had not materialized. And yet that didn’t mean the Republicans wouldn’t wind up winning control of both houses of Congress.

By 11, even Sen. Patty Murray’s reelection bid in Washington state was deemed too early to call. Other races continued to tighten. Herschel Walker was still slightly ahead in Georgia and John Fetterman in Pennsylvania, where the counting would continue for hours. No calls could be made about the House. But the night was young, and Democrats such as Kathy Hochul would eke out victories after seeming threatened.

ELECTION DAY 2022 IS OVER; READY OR NOT, HERE COMES 2024 WHITE HOUSE RACE

For what it’s worth, Fox coverage was led by journalists Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum, and CNN coverage was led by journalist Jake Tapper (not Wolf Blitzer, for the first time in almost two decades). But MSNBC went with an all-liberal panel led by Rachel Maddow.

Then there was the Trump factor. On election eve, Donald Trump faked out the media by having the word spread that he was going to announce his candidacy at an Ohio rally so he could take credit for the midterms.

He told his advisers he was strongly considering it, and they told reporters, and many Republicans were upset at the notion that it could boost Democratic turnout yesterday. Trump sounds out advisers on a lot of things he doesn’t wind up doing, but it’s moot because he’s now teasing a ""major announcement""--next Tuesday.

In an interview with NewsNation, Trump said of the Republicans: ""Well, I think if they win, I should get all the credit – and if they lose, I should not be blamed at all. But it’ll probably be just the opposite. When they win – I think they’re gonna do very well – I’ll probably be given very little credit even though in many cases I told people to run.""

Trump, who plans to announce next week–he warned DeSantis not to run for president after his lawyer said that would be ""career suicide""–is going to draw constant coverage, as he has in his post-presidency (in part because MSNBC and CNN love the ratings boost).

At the Ohio rally, Trump called Nancy Pelosi an ""animal,"" and he was not joking–the crowd actually cheered. He recalled a previous conversation where the House speaker asked him not to refer to illegal immigrants as animals, and then revelled in crossing that line.

SPLIT ELECTION RESULTS FOR TRUMP-BACKED CANDIDATES IN KEY RACES WHILE DESANTIS WINS BIG

Pointing to the ""fake"" media, the former president said: ""They’ll say, ‘What a horrible thing. He called Nancy Pelosi an animal.’"" He also called her ""Crazy Nancy Pelosi.""

Does he not have a scintilla of sympathy for the fact that her husband was almost murdered in that hammer attack? Is this the time to be calling her that dehumanizing name?

In an emotional interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, Pelosi tied the attack on her husband Paul to Jan. 6 and said both were ""fueled by misinformation.""

Pam Baldwin, 71, was walking her rottweiler, Bundy, at Albury Wodonga on the NSW-Victoria border when the incident happened.

The attack left her with bruises to her stomach and a deep gash on her arm.

She had been heading to a friend’s house at the time, along Nail Can Hill, when she sensed something behind her.

She turned to see a large kangaroo.

“It was a traumatic experience,” she told Channel 9’s Today.

“I just had the feeling someone was behind me, and I’ve turned around and you wouldn’t want to know what I said. And I’ve just looked up at these eyes and this nose and the next minute he’s just gone bang with his two back legs.

“I gave him a few choice words.”

Pam said that while people underestimate rottweilers, Bundy is the fifth rottweiler she’s had, and she praised his actions.

“I wouldn’t have another dog; he almost lost his life for me.

“He was within 20 to 40 seconds of being drowned because the kangaroos lead them into a dam if there’s one around.”

She said in the end her friends managed to scare off the roo with some long poles.

She believes kangaroos are becoming more problematic around her area, however she has found it difficult to get help.

“I went to the council and reported it. They didn’t want to know me,” she said.

“People take their children, ladies push their babies in a pram. What if it was one of them?”

She said people don’t realise how dangerous kangaroos can be.

“They are deadly,” she said.

Last month, a kangaroo killed a man in West Australia’s south, in the country’s first fatal kangaroo attack in more than 85 years.

It is believed the 77-year-old was attacked by the marsupial at his Redmond property, near Albany. Emergency services were called to the scene, but the kangaroo prevented paramedics from accessing the property.

The attack left her with bruises to her stomach and a deep gash on her arm. Today/Channel 9

Australian Reptile Park life science manager Hayley Shute said it was important to show respect around wild animals and remember how dangerous male kangaroos could be.

“The public sort of see kangaroos and koalas as fluffy, cuddly animals. I think it’s just important to note that they are wild animals and there’s a level of respect you have to give them,” she told NCA NewsWire.

“The icon, that picture of an Australian kangaroo, is usually a female kangaroo with a joey sticking his head out of the pouch and they look so cute and sweet.

“But male kangaroos, part of their life and hierarchy within the mob is to take on the male that’s bigger than it. There’s a struggle there to become the alpha male and that’s part of a male kangaroo’s life and behavior.

“At any point, these males are going to take on a threat to it and it’s a behavioral instinct for them.”

Ms Shute said she was not surprised that a male kangaroo could kill a man given their nature, size and strength.

“I don’t have the details of this specific case so I wouldn’t like to speculate, but it’s definitely not surprising that a male kangaroo could cause injuries such as this because they are so strong,” she said."
18dc1b12-3378-4b31-82a8-ee240172821b,"A man traveling from overseas has been fined $2,664 and had his visa cancelled after he tried to bring 13 pounds of meat products through Perth airport.

The international traveller had arrived at Perth airport from a country known to have foot and mouth disease on October 18.

Australian biosecurity officers uncovered the undeclared meat during a baggage inspection.

The undisclosed meat included six pounds of duck, three pounds of beef rendang, more than 500g of frozen beef and nearly 900g of chicken concealed in the man’s luggage.

The man answered “no” on his incoming passenger card when asked whether he was bringing any meat, poultry, fish, seafood, eggs, dairy, fruit or vegetables into Australia.

Failing to disclose any food products is a serious breach in of Australia’s biosecurity laws.

Those laws are designed to prevent the possible spread of devastating biosecurity diseases such as foot and mouth disease or African swine fever.

Foot and mouth disease doesn’t affect humans but is highly transmissible and causes lesions and lameness in cattle, sheep, goats and other cloven-hoofed animals.

Home Affairs Minister Clare O’Neil said the traveller had his visa cancelled by Australian Border Force (ABF) officers after biosecurity officers found the items.

“This is why legislation is in place to cancel the visa of any traveller who commits a significant biosecurity breach or repeatedly contravenes biosecurity laws,” Ms O’Neil said.

Travelers who have their visa cancelled are removed from Australia on the earliest available flight and can face an exclusion period of three years before they are able to reapply for a visa.

Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Minister Murray Watt said the Australian government introduced tougher laws to ban meat items for personal use from countries with foot and mouth disease.

“These types of products are a major risk for bringing food and mouth disease into Australia, and that’s why we make no apologies for our strict biosecurity measures,” Mr Watt said.

“The traveller contravened subsection 533(1) of the Biosecurity Act 2015 by knowingly providing a false or misleading document (the Incoming Passenger Card) to a biosecurity officer on arrival to Australia.

“This is a very serious breach and this traveller has been hit with the toughest penalties at our disposal.”

Mr Watt said if the forbidden products had managed to pass ABF officers, they could have been a potential harmful biosecurity risk to Australian agricultural industries.

“The actions of biosecurity officers and ABF at the border have once again protected the Australian community and our agricultural sector from harmful biosecurity risks that have the potential to do enormous damage,” he said.

“Strictly enforcing our borders ensures a strong biosecurity system to protect our international trade reputation as a leading supplier of safe, healthy, high-quality food.

“All travellers should openly and honestly declare food items on arrival in Australia so that biosecurity officers can inspect the items and assess the biosecurity risk.

“If the goods are permitted into Australia, they will be returned to the traveller.

“However, if they don’t declare risk items, they will be caught and penalised.”

The Australian government is also planning to establish a new Northern Australian Co-ordination Network to help manage the threat of lumpy skin disease and foot and mouth disease."
a398a050-09de-44e9-b653-86f2dfd2a3cd,"An Australian ax murderer Googled “killing someone with axe what part of the body to go for,” before repeatedly hacking her boyfriend in the head in a jealous rage, prosecutors said in court Friday.

The 34-year-old, identified only by the pseudonym Gina Smith, searched online for where to aim her weapon before butchering her longtime partner in September 2020, the New South Wales Supreme Court heard at her sentencing hearing.

Smith called a taxi after the gruesome research and had the driver wait outside of a shop as she bought a Trojan brand hatchet — which she then used to repeatedly chop her boyfriend as he lay reading his iPad in a Sydney townhouse, according to The Guardian.

Smith — who allegedly stabbed her 35-year-old partner with a meat cleaver the month before — sent him furious him text messages accusing him of cheating on her the day before his slaughter, according to court documents.

In the weeks before the butchering she searched “how to poison someone,” “can you kill someone with hot boiling water” and “killing someone in the neck fast,” Australia’s ABC news.

Shortly before the attack, she also Googled, “killing someone with an axe what part of body to go for,” the court heard.

Smith, who wasn’t named for legal reasons, has since pleaded guilty to murder.

Prosecutor Gabrielle Steedman presented her online search history as evidence of premeditation in the sentencing submission presented in court Friday.

The 34-year-old woman googled “killing someone with an axe what part of the body to go for” before repeatedly striking her boyfriend with an axe.

Unison Scotland has written to ministers - including Deputy First Minister John Swinney and Health and Social Care Secretary Humza Yousaf - to demand pay rises equal to their local government counterparts.

Strike ballots have been taking place across Scotland, with staff at two organisations - Capability Scotland and Glasgow Women's Aid - both voting overwhelmingly in favour of industrial action.

Peter Hunter, Unison Scotland regional manager, said it is just the ""tip of the iceberg"" as he warned more third sector organisations will follow.

In its letter to ministers on behalf of Glasgow Women's Aid, the union said: ""These workers support women, children and young people who are experiencing domestic abuse, yet this sector is being neglected.""

Unison, Scotland's largest trade union, warned staff are leaving the vital social care sector to seek better pay elsewhere.

Employers at Capability Scotland, which supports disabled children and adults, have had to apply for the limited cash local authorities allocate to fund care in their areas.

Mr Hunter added: ""The sector is in crisis with staff leaving in droves in search of employment with better pay and working conditions. There are also thousands of people awaiting the care they deserve who continue to suffer as the workforce diminishes.

""Many third sector organisations, like Capability Scotland and Glasgow Women's Aid, are reliant on the limited funds local authorities allocate to fund care in their areas - funding which has long been inadequate.

""This means third sector workers find themselves in a tussle between their employer, local councils and the Scottish Government. These workers deserve better and, at the very least, the same pay as their counterparts in local government.

""These ballot results are just the tip of the iceberg and a wave of strikes could follow unless the Scottish Government deliver fair work and funding to the third sector as a matter of urgency.""

A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ""The Scottish Government has received a letter from Unison and will respond in due course.

""We recognise the challenges faced by the third sector in the current cost-of-living crisis and we continue to support these organisations to deliver their important work.

""We have committed to increase multi-year funding for the third sector and where possible we will do so.

""However, our ability to fulfil our devolved responsibilities remains a significant challenge due to the UK Government's budgeting approach. As the Deputy First Minister has made clear to Parliament, the Scottish Government budget is now worth around £1.7 billion less than it was when announced in December.""

b428a093-4b4e-4823-8bec-24c29c16ed41,"A motorist has been hit with a $680 fine and four demerit points after a roadside camera on the caught the front seat passenger carrying out a “high risk” act on the man behind the wheel.

A photo of the pair made waves on social media after being shared on the Facebook group “Phone and Seatbelt Detection Camera Locations Queensland”.

The Department of Transport and Main Roads (DTMR) said that the passenger’s behavior would have resulted in an infringement notice in relation to “passengers not wearing a seatbelt or wearing it incorrectly,” according to the Courier Mail.

Social media users were divided over what was actually going on in the photo, which was taken on the Pacific Motorway at Upper Coomera.

Some said they believed the person in the passenger seat was sleeping and not engaged in “high-risk behavior.”

A motorist was fined hundreds of dollars for their passenger’s questionable act.

Several others pointed out the four-figure fine was “hard to swallow”.

“Nahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh surely not … OMG,” one person commented.

“Did someone fall asleep on your lap? Is that what your being fined for?” another wrote.

“Pretty sure they’re asleep lol,” another said.

A DTMR spokesman said the passenger’s actions were “high-risk behaviour” that could cause a serious or fatal crash.

New data from the Australian Road Deaths Database showed Queensland suffered 284 road deaths between July 2021 and July 2022.

Fifty-four fatalities were attributed to the 17-to-25 age group."

An Australian woman redefined “sex on the beach” after happening across an alleged “whale penis” while beachcombing in Queensland. Footage of the supposed phallic flotsam is racking up millions of views online.

“‘What the f – – k is that?” the aghast woman — who posts under the handle @bootscootinaf — wondered in one of the TikTok clips detailing the “disgusting” purported Moby member, which she found on Magnetic Island.

In a separate clip with more than 3.6 million views, the woman said she had been walking on the beach of the idyllic isle, when all of a sudden, she discovered the mutilated alleged member floating in the “crystal-clear water.” Accompanying footage shows the “massive” pink object, which appears to be sliced in several places and whose fleshy insides are visible at the end where it was seemingly detached from an animal. In another clip, she places her foot alongside the supposed phallus to show how it’s nearly “the size of my leg.”

Internet debates whether TikTokker’s discovery was a “bitten off” whale penis.

The alleged whale member was nearly as big as the TikToker’s leg. TikTok/bootscootinaf

Needless to say, many social media oceanographers speculated that the jumbo appendage had once belonged to a whale.

“That’s a wales pp,” declared one armchair zoologist, while another wrote, “DON’T TOUCH IT it’s a whale thing.”

Of course a few TikTok wits couldn’t resist making sophomoric wisecracks. “He’s just called Moby now,” joked one in reference to the cetacean’s long-lost schlong.

Another social media comedian quipped, “Free Willy has taken it TOO FAR.”

Humpback whale penises can grow up to 10-feet long. TikTok/bootscootinaf

Australian wildlife expert Dr. Vanessa Pirotta has since weighed-in on the bizarre discovery on TikTok, noting that it’s “hard to know exactly what this object is without seeing it in the flesh.”

“As a scientist, we want to have as much information on the size and also how it looks from every single angle, so we just don’t know at this stage,” she said.

However, she noted that the alleged appendage was found near a popular breeding ground for humpback whales, whose penises can grow to 10-feet long — a whole foot longer than the tallest man who ever lived.

Some TikTokers speculated that the alleged whale penis had been bitten off during a whale-mating ritual gone awry. TikTok/bootscootinaf

Nonetheless, Dr. Pirotta threw cold water on popular TikTok theories that the member was bitten off during a whale mating ritual.

“If this is a male humpback whale penis, it is very unlikely that it was bitten off by another humpback whale,” she said. “These whales don’t have any teeth, rather they have long hair-like strands known as baleen.”

She added, “To bite another male’s penis off is something that I’ve not ever heard of.”

And while the scientists noted that toothy killer whales — which prey on other cetaceans — could’ve amputated it, she found this outcome unlikely as there were no other markings on the alleged member.

“‘This is just a mystery at this stage,” Pirotta lamented.

The whale willy caper follows rumors that Scotland’s mythical Loch Ness monster is actually just a whale penis.

A disgruntled train traveler, who recently moved to Sydney, has shared a snap of a person on their phone while their bag sits on the seat opposite.

“Recently moved to Sydney and find this a lot where people are standing in the metro and then there are people who keep bags on the empty seats and show no eagerness to move the bags so someone can sit! I find it disrespectful and frustrating. Is this normal?” the person asked on Reddit.

Many users told the new Sydneysider he should have asked for the other person to move their bag, adding it’s only impolite if the other passenger refuses to move their belongings after being asked.

“Normal to do it, but also normal to ask for them to move it and normal for them to have no problem moving it,” one person said.

The photo shows a person on their phone while their bag sits on the seat opposite. Reddit

“People sometimes need a little push to be polite. Like a child that forgets to say thank you. ‘Hey mate, is it cool if I sit here?’ Very rarely will you get a no,” wrote another.

A third added: “People here are not disrespectful, they are just a bit careless.”

Some claimed it was acceptable for the person to keep their bag on the particular seat in the photo because it was such a tight space.

“You should be able to move the seat back so the seat faces the other way. Just ask them to move their bag. I used to commute in those trains and there’s really not enough room there for 2 adults to sit facing each other,” the person said.

But another argued: “If you flip it you will just be facing somebody else and rubbing your knees together. This is the one seat I think its OK to put your bag on.”

“To be fair, that specific seat on the city rail trains is an honest no go. No one sits there if someone is sitting across,” one Sydneysider informed the new resident.

“Nah there is no way you expect to sit in that seat. You want to play footsies with a stranger?” another wrote.

One person agreed it was “the unspoken code”, while someone else said they’d rather stand.

“Right. No one wants to be sat knee-to-knee with a stranger, especially not post-Covid. I’d rather stand than sit there,” someone else wrote.

Users suggested the rules of what was acceptable on public transport had changed since Covid with travelers taking up more space and being expected to give more space.

“It’s gotten worse because of Covid, people think taking more space is more acceptable now,” one person wrote.

“The rules kind of changed with Covid too. Most won’t go for this seat or the middle of three anymore, so the bag thing became a bit more normal,” said another."
51946707-1c25-4a96-b5d9-8663b3ea1087,"A 3-week-old boy most likely suffocated while pressed against a fabric sling worn by his mother, an NSW coroner has found.

Harvey McGlinn was found pale and motionless when his mother unwrapped the sling at a community health center on the Central Coast in 2019.

Staff at the center frantically performed CPR on the baby, but Harvey could not be revived.

Three-week-old Harvey McGlinn apparently suffocated in his mother’s cloth sling. GoFundMe

“The evidence establishes that the position of Harvey‘s neck, with his chin on his chest, compromised his airway,” the coroner said in his findings delivered on Thursday.

The newborn was Tattika Dunn’s third son with fiancé Bill McGlinn.

“It’s still very raw and my heart feels like it’s been ripped in a million pieces,” Dunn wrote in a Facebook post a month after her son’s death.

She declined to be involved in the inquest. There is no suggestion of a breach of duty of care.

The coroner ruled that Harvey’s airway must have been blocked. GoFundMe

“Harvey‘s relatively low weight may have resulted in less muscle and head control resulting in a difficulty in maintaining a patent airway from the way that Harvey was positioned in the sling,” the coroner said.

The health center staff and product manufacturer were both cleared of any liability over the death.

The product included a suffocation warning and an instructional booklet that warned that babies needed to be carried upright with their chin off the parent’s chest.

Harvey’s mother declined to participate in the inquest. GoFundMe

Witnesses told the coroner that Harvey’s entire body was inside the loosely fitted sling.

NSW Health has since made changes to advice about the risks of baby slings, the coroner said.

﻿NSW Health director of maternity, child and family Deborah Matha told the inquest that banning slings might be the only way to eliminate their risks.

However, she noted that this would be hard to do, as they were customary in some cultures and some disabled people relied on them as a necessity.

A new acronym, TICKS, has been devised to help parents avoid the same devastating loss.

It stands for Tight, In view, Close, Keep chin off chest and Supported. It advises parents to ensure the baby is held tight and high, is in view of the parent at all times, is close enough to kiss, is in a position so their chin is off their chest and never curled, and their back is well supported and in a natural position."

“My understanding of what a vaccine is supposed to do is to literally prevent it from spreading to other people. Like that’s how the measles vaccine works. That’s how polio works. It inoculates you so you don’t spread it to other people.. And so you can’t get it. And she just said that this week, well, we had to work at the speed of science and therefore we didn’t test whether it prevented transmission. But the big lie that we were all told, and we were all forced into these mandates, people were run of society across the world, if you had questions about the vaccine, if you were part of the great, unclean, unvaccinated class, for daring to say, hey, I know a lot of friends who are vaccinated and they’re all getting COVID. So are they spreading COVID? And it was all those things, like all these other things surrounding the pandemic that was obvious because it was common sense, but yet it took like six months for the experts to finally weigh in. It took six months for the CDC to finally admit that, yes, vaccinated people can spread the virus to other people. And so that just destroyed all of their credibility for any of these mandates that they put in place. And yet it’s not even a lead story.”

“I literally made this point in my op-ed about not getting vaccinated a year ago, in November of 2021. Because Pfizer’s chairman told Lester Holt in December of 2020 that he wasn’t sure if it would stop transmission. Moderna’s chief medical officer around November of 2020 said that we need to be careful as we get the results to not overinterpret because they don’t have concrete data that it would reduce transmission. So this is something that was known. They never tested for it. And I was making this point last year. But the problem is, a lot of people on the Right were cowards, to be perfectly honest, and the media was completely disinterested in getting to the bottom of anything. They were more interested in propagandizing a vaccine that had not even a year of safety data. And the reality is we still have no idea what long term this vaccine is going to do to people. So I get it and I understand that it’s a big deal. But as someone who was there a year ago, it’s just really frustrating that instead of people listening or being more open, more people weren’t open to having this conversation a year ago, and instead they did the damage by pushing the Big Pharma’s propaganda.”

Lisa also explains why she believes vaccine mandates are unnecessary and not based in science. Listen to the podcast to hear what else she had to say!"

Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is doing the opposite of what he intended: strengthening support for Ukrainian statehood worldwide while weakening Russia’s own stability as a nation, an expert has said. His comments come as recent events suggest the Russian President has increasingly been backed into a corner over his decisions on the war.

John Bryson, Professor of economic geography at Birmingham University, said the despot now faces three signs at home of the existence of Russia as a nation under threat of erosion. He noted the vast swathes of Russians who had left the country since Putin announced Russia’s first mobilisation since World War 2, many young men fearing they will be forced into serving. The mobilisation has sparked outrage across the country, amid reports of Russians being detained by police if they had been called up. Those fears have been compounded by the recent successful counter-offensives Ukrainian forces have been able to launch against beleaguered troops, many of whom have reportedly been told their contracts have been extended indefinitely. At least seven are believed to have died in Russian training camps since the mobilisation. READ MORE: Russian intelligence officers and military chiefs ‘now fleeing Crimea’

READ MORE Putin nightmare as Russian economy ‘collapsing’ The Kremlin has denied reports in the Russian media that as many as 700,000 people have fled the country since the announcement was made on September 21. Not only do these people represent a loss of potential economic and military power for Putin, but represents a wider change, Professor Bryson said. He commented: “These are citizens who no longer recognise the Kremlin’s authority. Effectively, these are Russian citizens in name only rather than citizens who stand side-by-side with the strategies and actions of Russia’s state institutions.” At the same time, Russian war correspondents on Telegram and even members of the state-controlled media are now questioning the Government on its actions as what was originally anticipated to be a quick and easy victory drags on into its seventh month.

Professor Bryson: 'Ukraine is now much more of a state now than it was on February 21, 2022'

Russia is now 'a de-emerging economy or a declining or shrinking nation' thanks to the war

Professor Bryson said this criticism “highlights that there is a significant problem emerging within the Russian state”. Thirdly, Russia is now “a de-emerging economy or a declining or shrinking nation” thanks to the financial hardship the war in Ukraine has caused, a process which the Kremlin was “driving”, he said. A recent study by experts at Yale into the state of the Russian economy suggested it was on the brink of collapse, with exports hammered by sanctions, imports slashed, and a mass-exodus of over 1,000 companies. The authors found that cutting Europe off from its oil and gas supply would hurt its economy more than the European one, as it weakened Putin’s negotiating hand in Asia. A lack of parts meant that Russians were having to cannibalise old appliances for parts. DON'T MISS:

READ MORE Ukraine will 'probably win' Russia war as 5 phases of conflict exposed Professor Bryson remarked: “Governments, companies, non-governmental organisations and individuals no longer respect the institutions of the Russian state. Too often the institutions of the Russian state have demonstrated that they say one thing and do another.” As Russia’s state authority appears to crumble, in cruel irony Putin’s horrific actions against Ukraine have advanced its standing as an independent nation in the eyes of the world by decades, making his recent annexation claims far less credible and far more dangerous. Professor Bryson explained: “Statehood is based not just on a territory that is recognised under international law, but is also founded on a set of institutions that are respected by citizens and other states. Once the institutions of a state are no longer respected by its citizens, and by other countries, then that state ceases to be viable. There is an interesting paradox here. “Putin’s attempt to integrate Ukrainian territory into Russia has been a fundamental driver in enhancing respect and recognition of Ukraine’s statehood. Ukrainian citizens have become more Ukrainian and countries across the globe, with some few exceptions, are engaging in activities that directly acknowledge the continued existence of the Ukrainian state. Ukraine is now much more of a state now than it was on February 21, 2022.”

'Once the institutions of a state are no longer respected by its citizens, it ceases to be viable'

He added: “Russia is experiencing an unusual process of statehood in reverse. By October 2022, one can argue that Russia’s existence as a state is threatened. This threat comes not from the West or from Ukraine but from the Kremlin, or by the actions and strategies of all associated with Putin’s special Ukrainian military operation.” Putin’s recent announcement that Russia has annexed four parts of Ukraine and would defend them with nuclear power if necessary has been widely seen as a desperate bid to galvanise support for the war back home, but it is one that has placed him in an acute position. Russian forces seem unlikely to make a major breakthrough on the ground any time soon, and Ukraine is waging a searing counter-offensive against enemy lines in the north and south. Putin’s only moves now appear to be a humiliating climb-down or risking his position to intensify the war.

Vladimir Putin’s tactics when it comes to pursuing his war in Ukraine have been ‘disorganised, chaotic and arbitrary’ - and has left him with ‘few options left’. Professor John R Bryson said the Russian President’s decision to issue a partial mobilisation order last month has left him facing three major problems - and warned any use of nuclear weapons would prove “catastrophic” for Russia itself.

John R Bryson, Professor of Enterprise and Economic Geography at the University of Birmingham, also said following Putin’s mobilisation order aimed at drafting 300,000 reservists into his armed forces, more than that number had now fled the country - describing the situation as “astonishing”. In a comment piece published today, Prof Bryson said the situation was becoming so bad even journalists employed by state-controlled media outlets were starting to question Russia tactics. He said: “This questioning goes hand-in-hand with the mass exodus of highly educated Russians which commenced on 21 September 2022 with the announcement of some form of ‘partial mobilisation’ of military reservists.

These are astonishing figures.” Speaking after Putin’s annexation of four Ukrainian oblasts, or regions, Prof Bryson said: “Putin has created a major problem for the Kremlin, and this is a problem of his own making.

“There is an interesting paradox here. Putin’s attempt to integrate Ukrainian territory into Russia has been a fundamental driver in enhancing respect and recognition of Ukraine’s statehood.” There were three important signs indicating what Prof Bryson referred to as an “on-going erosion of Russian statehood” which he said jeopardised its very existence. He explained: “First, a core sign comes from the more than 300,000 citizens who have decided to flee Russia. These are citizens who no longer recognise the Kremlin’s authority.

“Second, the on-going questioning of the Kremlin’s actions by representatives of Russia’s state-controlled media highlights that there is a significant problem emerging within the Russian state. “Third, Russia is classified as an emerging or developing economy and ultimately might become an emerged economy. Russia is, however, an emerging economy in reverse or is perhaps better defined as the first of a new form of national economy – a de-emerging economy or a declining or shrinking nation.” Prof Bryson added: “Putin has very few options left.

Vladimir Putin’s last desperate move of launching nukes may not even be an option for the tyrant as a source claims Moscow’s military elite wouldn’t allow him to press the button, and could replace him with a close confidant. The Kremlin has made multiple threats alluding to the possibility of using nuclear weapons, which have only worsened as Kyiv launches a powerful counter offensive and Russia has claimed Ukrainian territory as its own. But according to a key source, Putin would face a coup if he dared try to descend his country into nuclear warfare. The source added the despot would likely be replaced with an alleged criminal wanted by the FBI for interfering with US elections.

A British source who advises governments on Russia told the Mirror: “A military mutiny is the most likely end for Putin’s rule.” The source added that for the Kremlin elite, Putin’s nuclear threats towards the West are merely part of a war of words, and function as leverage against Western involvement in the war. However, the source claimed, they would not allow these words to translate into real military action by the despot. If he attempted this, senior officers would be likely to mutiny, mobilising against the Kremlin and forcing Putin to either step down, or die. However, his replacement may not be a much better option. The source stated: “Faced with Putin’s recklessness and the need to prevent use of nuclear weapons, the military are most likely to stage a coup to depose him.

Vladimir Putin could be replaced with wanted criminal in coup if he tries to launch nukes

“The second most likely group are Putin’s Presidential Administration of acolytes, ex-KGB spies and ex-military led by Evgeny Viktorovich Prigozhin. So far they think his nuke statements are serving their purpose.” Russian oligarch Mr Prigozhin, 61, would be Putin’s most likely replacement, they claimed. Nicknamed Putin’s Cook after his high-end catering firm worked for the tyrant, Mr Prigozhin is currently wanted by the FBI, for his “alleged involvement in a conspiracy to defraud the United States by impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful functions of the Federal Election Commission, the United States Department of Justice, and the United States Department of State.” The FBI claim Mr Prigozhin created the Internet Research Agency, which it alleges created thousands of fake online personas and used other methods to influence the 2016 presidential election. The American intelligence agency is offering a reward of up to $250,000 for information leading to his arrest. In 1981, he was sentenced to twelve years imprisonment under articles of robbery, fraud, and involving teenagers in crime.

Putin may be threatening to use nuclear weapons - but Moscow elites wouldn't let it happen

Mr Prigozhin spent nine years in prison before he was released. He also admitted last month to founding the mercenary Wagner Group, which has been dubbed “Putin’s private army” and has been accused of war crimes as well as links to neo-nazism. According to the military source, other possible endings to Putin’s rule include “popular uprisings, disorder, insurrection and breakaway by Siberia, the far east and far north regions”. Commentators have observed that Russia’s claimed annexation of four regions in eastern Ukraine has escalated the possibility Putin will resort to nuclear weapons. This is because Russia has insisted it will only use such weapons after “aggression against the Russian Federation with conventional weapons when the very existence of the state is threatened”. While the annexing of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson has not been formally recognised by most of the world, efforts by Ukraine to reclaim these areas could give the Kremlin an excuse to use nuclear weapons, as in their eyes this will constitute attacks on Russian soil.

The University of Birmingham academic claimed that Vladimir Putin ""is losing"" his battle in Ukraine as the losses suffered by Russia in recent weeks are extremely significant. Professor Lucas explained how significant it was that Ukrainian forces had managed to seize back key areas of their land which were previously under Russian control in recent weeks. The academic claimed that Ukrainian forces were now in a good position to seize back Crimea which had been illegally annexed by Putin in 2014.

Professor Lucas warned that Putin underestimated the support from the West to Ukraine and thought he could isolate the country from the international community. He told GB News: ""Vladimir Putin is losing, that is how significant this is. ""Seven months after the Russian invasion what Ukraine has done in just a matter of weeks and the past month is they've regained much of the territory that Russia took during the invasion. ""That includes the North-East: the Kharkiv region it includes parts of what we call Donetsk and Luhansk which is in the East and the big breakthrough on Monday was an advance of about 20 miles against the Russians in the South in Kherson.

Prof Lucas added: ""But secondly Ukraine is now on the verge of being able to move into territory that the Russians have controlled since 2014 through their proxies. ""That includes what we call the Donbas region in the Est and it includes Crimea, this big peninsula that Putin just seized that he just annexed without really a fight back from anyone eight years ago. ""So Putin who made this big gamble well he gambled on two points, James Cleverly raised them, first he said you know if I go in quickly I can take Kyiv and I can get rid of Volodymyr Zelensky and his government, I can occupy within days, weeks... Failure. ""Secondly I can split off Ukraine from the international community and isolate it, people won't risk the cost of supporting it politically, economically, militarily... Failure.

""Does he go for a third failure? By annexing these territories and calling them Russian, well that is exactly what he did last Friday and within days that is coming undone."" Putin has faced a number of losses as Ukraine has managed to successfully regain significant regions of its land. Putin's original plan in February was to storm Ukraine and have the country under Russian control within three days, this plan has taken well over seven months and is still not completed. Throughout the ongoing illegal invasion, Ukraine has received much global support from Western countries who have vowed to help their pushback on the Russian onslaught in the form of Russian sanctions, and by sending Ukrainian troops top-of-the-range weapons systems.

2f4bd51d-cfa7-438f-b386-275c53e0e70d,"The mysterious final resting place of the Finnish-owned sailing ship Glenbank has finally been solved, after going missing more than a century ago.

Divers made the incredible discovery off the coast of Western Australia after the ship went missing during a massive cyclone in 1911.

One seaman survived, a 22-year-old Finnish man by the name of Antti Ketola, who was rescued after swimming to a nearby island.

Shipwreck Hunters Australia recently discovered the site of the Glenbank – 111 years since it disappeared – and reported the find to Western Australian Museum.

Previous 1 of 4 Next The Finnish owned ship Glenbank has been located off the coast of Western Australia. The ship hit a major storm and sank in 1911. The Glenbank was led by Captain Fredrik Moberg. The Glenbank's crew had 20 members, only one survived the wreck.

The Museum’s maritime archaeologists then brought their expertise to the discovery and ultimately confirmed it was in fact the missing Glenbank ship.

Johnny Debnam of Shipwreck Hunters Australia, together with Kevin Deacon, Luke Leech, Justin Leech and Tom Radley, were part of a group of local fishermen who first found the remote, deep water site of the shipwreck.

“We were incredibly excited when we first discovered the ship,” Debnam, who is also part of Shipwreck Hunters Australia, said.

“After undertaking a full survey, diving and filming the huge wreck site, abundant with sharks, turtles, dolphins and other marine life, the team was able to interpret pivotal evidence from the seabed, along with a deep dive into the archives, to help piece together the ship’s incredible story.”

What happened to the ship

In November 1910, the steel barque Glenbank arrived at Balla Balla, WA.

It had been chartered by Whim Well Copper Mines Ltd to transport copper ore from Balla Balla to the UK.

The ship’s crew was made up of 20 members, including Russians, Norwegians and Fins and was led by Captain Fredrik Moberg.

However, after setting sail for England in 1911, the Glenbank hit a ferocious storm off the coast, causing it to sink.

According to Shipwreck Hunters and following extensive research, it has been determined unsecured cargo of copper ore shifted during the storm and destroyed the hull and deck – causing it to capsize.

“The discovery of Glenbank is very significant in helping tell the tale of global trade at the turn of the century and giving a voice to those who tragically lost their lives on that fateful day in 1911,” maritime archaeologist Dr. Deb Shefi from Western Australian Museum said.

She said it’s not often they find a silhouette of a ship, with the masts aligned, resting on the sea floor like this.

“The unseasonably good weather meant Glenbank was ready to shed its secrets and we were able to record measurements and details that will assist further research into this tragic shipwreck,” Dr. Shefi said.

The 22-year-old Finnish seaman who managed to get to safety on Legendre Island was stranded there for three days, surviving on raw shellfish. He was eventually rescued by the pearling lugger Pearl and taken to Cossack, WA.

The Shipwreck Hunters Australia team was able to track down Mr Ketola’s descendants in Finland who had no idea about their ancestor’s incredible shipwreck story.

“Whenever he [Antti Ketola] lived here in Finland, there were no stories about it, and he never talked about it, so it has been totally hidden what has happened to Antti,” Matti Latva-Panula, grandson of the lone Glenbank survivor, now in his 80s, said.

“From now on the story is going to live in the family. All the children and grandchildren will know about it.”

The discovery of the Glenbank shipwreck is documented in episode one of the Disney+ Original series, Shipwreck Hunters Australia, which premiered this week on the streaming platform."

A radiation risk remains to both marine life and tourists around the site of Britain's first nuclear test, which was located off of the coast of Western Australia. Comprising more than 250 low-lying islands and islets, the Montebello Islands Marine Park covers some 60,000 hectares of ocean. These waters are among the world’s most biodiverse marine environments, and attract visitors in the form of fishers, divers and snorkelers.

The Montebello Islands played host to Britain’s first ever nuclear test, codenamed “Operation Hurricane” on the morning of October 3, 1952. The experiment saw a 25-kiloton atomic bomb set off on board the Royal Navy frigate HMS Plym, which was moored in Main Bay on Trimouille Island. A ship was chosen as the detonation platform in order to simulate the effects of a nuclear weapon being smuggled into British harbour on board a vessel. Two further nuclear tests were undertaken on the Montebello Islands under the auspices of “Operation Mosaic” — one on May 6 and the other on June 19, 1956. The goal of these trials was to experiment with increasing the yield of nuclear weaponry through boosting with lithium-6 and deuterium, along with a natural uranium tamper.

The research is being undertaken by radioecologist Madison Hoffman of the Edith Cowan University

The research is being undertaken by radioecologist Madison Hoffman of the Edith Cowan University and her colleagues — and is expected to continue into 2024. The team have already collected and analysed more than 100 samples of marine sediment and life from the underwater ecosystems around the Montebello Islands. Ms Hoffman said: “It is really important that we try and understand exactly what type of radionuclides and what levels of radiation remain in the marine ecosystems at the Montebello Islands. “We’re focusing now on mapping out areas where higher levels of radionuclides are found in marine sediment all around the Marine Park.

Ms Hoffman continued: “The next step will be to test the different organisms that we collected, from aquatic plants and sea cucumbers right through to coral trout.” The Montebello Islands are home to more than 630 types of mollusc, 450 species of fish. 170 species of sea stars and urchins and 150 different varieties of coral. Ms Hoffman added: “We have detected levels of radionuclides from the nuclear tests above what would be considered a background reading, or levels that you might get from the sand at your local beach. “The final phase of the project will be to use these readings and some sophisticated models to see if there is any impact on the marine creatures that live, breathe and reproduce in the sediment.” READ MORE:

Russian President Vladimir Putin's horror threat to commit a nuclear attack against Ukraine amid his brutal invasion may be more than just empty words, a US security advisor has warned. Lloyd Austin spoke about this to CNN this over the weekend, claiming that Moscow may go ahead and press the red button, unleashing weapons from its 6,000-strong nuclear arsenal seven months into the conflict, after revealing that the US had been drafting up responses to this kind of scenario. He said: ""There are no checks on Mr Putin. He made the irresponsible decision to invade Ukraine, he could make another decision.”

This comes after the Russian President himself warned that his own nuclear threats were in fact not just a bluff. Putin said last week: “In the event of a threat to the territorial integrity of our country … we will certainly make use of all weapon systems available to us. “This is not a bluff.” And Mr Austin was not the only one who appeared to believe that Putin is in fact telling the truth this time. Fiona Hill, a member of the National Security Council staff under President Trump, told Los Angeles News: It isn’t a bluff. He’s losing on the battlefield, so he’s trying to intimidate Ukraine and the West into giving up."" This comes after Putin himself admitted that Russia's invasion of his neighbouring country may not be going as well as he might have hoped. The Russian President admitted that ""mistakes were made"" during his mobilisation. He said: ""In the course of this mobilisation, many questions arise and it is necessary to correct all the mistakes and correct them from happening"".

The US has warned that Putin's nuclear threat may not be a bluff

Lloyd Austin said Putin could make another ""irresponsible decision""

It comes after Russian troops were forced to pull out of Lyman just days after the Kremlin said it was annexing the city in a humiliating turn of events for Moscow. The eastern city in the Donetsk province has a population of 20,000 and is part of one of four regions that Russia declared it was annexing. But just hours after Ukraine’s Defence Ministry warned that its forces were entering the city, Russia’s Ministry of Defence said it responded by pulling its troops out of Lyman to avoid a situation where its forces were trapped. The ministry said in a statement posted on Telegram: ""Due to the risk to be encircled, the allied forces were withdrawn"" from the area and sent to “more advantageous” locations. Hamish de Bretton Gordon, a nuclear expert and fellow from Cambridge University, told Express.co.uk that the more Putin's troops struggle on the battlefield, the ""closer we are getting"" to a nuclear attack.

He said: ""I think Putin is clinging on by his fingernails and will say anything to justify whatever he does to stave off defeat in Ukraine. Add this to the forced annexation of 4 regions and we are getting closer to when/where Putin thinks he can use nuclear weapons."" And if Putin did decide to unleash a nuclear warhead, he has a terrifying arsenal to choose from. This includes six ""super-weapons"", such as the Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), dubbed Satan 2 by the West. Russia launched the 16,000mph rocket in a missile test back in April, but the US downplayed the incident as a threat at the time. Spokesman John Kirby said in a press briefing that “testing is routine, and it was not a surprise"", He added that the US “has not deemed the test to be a threat to the United States or its allies”.

Around 100 activists rushed the entrance of the Sydney International Convention Center, but police cut them off. The activists directly confronted some attendees as they entered the building, and Sky News Australia reported that former Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage was the chief target of the protests, whom one protester accused of orchestrating a ""campaign against migrants in the U.K.""

Farage claimed that Conservatives had a ""higher moral purpose"" to resist the protests, which he accused of aiming to ""close down, shutdown and cancel"" those they disagreed with.

Speakers took aim at cancel culture and the pandemic response, which shut down businesses for months and caused massive financial loss as the public tried to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic.

4ca06cb4-dd84-404c-8a54-76758b0c23ea,"Debate over which famous faces should appear on the country’s currency has reignited, with two dedicated fans campaigning in a desperate attempt to get one Aussie icon into our wallets.

Principal petitioners Vincent Wu and Kirby Miles have started two separate petitions in a bid to feature “crocodile hunter” Steve Irwin on the $5 note.

Their goal is to have the Australian conservationist, wildlife expert and TV personality’s portrait feature on the lowest value note opposed to that of King Charles III.

And their hopes may become a reality after Assistant Treasury Minister Andrew Leigh revealed that the new king may not necessarily replace his mother on the $5 note in the way new coins will feature him.

Mr. Leigh informed reporters in Canberra earlier last month that the monarch would feature on Australian coins “as a matter of tradition”. However this is not the case for the country’s pink and purple note.

“The decision to include the Queen’s face on the $5 note was about her personally rather than about her status as the monarch so that transition [to Charles on the note] isn’t automatic,” he said.

This potentially means the door is wide open for suggestions on who should make the next appearance on the $5 note.

According to the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), the $5 paper bank note was first issued in 1967, featuring Sir Joseph Banks and Caroline Chisholm.

A portrait of Queen Elizabeth II was then introduced in 1992 on the country’s first $5 polymer note. This was then upgraded in 2016, featuring the same image however was updated for security purposes.

A fourth edition of the $5 note was the Federation banknotes which were circulated to commemorate Australia’s Centenary of Federation in 2001, featuring Sir Henry Parkes and Catherine Helen Spence.

So far, Mr. Wu and Mr. Miles’ petitions, which are listed on Australian Parliament House website, have gained a collective 42 signatures.

“The death of Queen Elizabeth II and the proclamation of King Charles III raises an important question about the future of Australian currency,” Mr. Miles stated under the petition reason subheading.

“We propose keeping all existing $5 notes featuring Queen Elizabeth II in circulation and introducing a new $5 note honouring Australian zookeeper Steve Irwin.”

Mr. Wu added there was no one “more vital to Australian culture” than Steve Irwin.

“Steve is beloved by all and has become synonymous with the Australian values we hold so dearly,” Mr. Wu said.

“My day would be better and I’d have a good day seeing Steve smiling back at me,” a supporter commented. ITV/Shutterstock

“He epitomised the spirit of mateship; he deeply loved the Australian wildlife, working hard towards conservation and education but perhaps most importantly he’s just a good bloke.”

Irwin died in September 2006 after being pierced in the chest by a stingray barb while filming in the Great Barrier Reef.

This isn’t the first time the late wildlife activist has been nominated to feature on Australia’s currency.

Six years ago, another fan took to change.org to support the idea of having Irwin feature on the $100 note.

That petition attracted more than 31,000 signatures however it wasn’t enough to replace Sir John Monash or Dame Nellie Melba who currently appear on the $100 note.

Irwin isn’t the only Australian icon up for consideration, with many taking to Twitter to share their aspirations for the $5 contender.

Among the Aussie legends being discussed for the top spot are Kylie Minogue, Dame Edna, Anne Edmonds, Olivia Newton-John, Bert Newton, Shane Warne, Kathy Freeman and even Luke Hemmings from band 5 Seconds of Summer.

The endless possibilities of who could replace the Queen on the note has amassed discussion online, even attracting international attention.

“Hi I’m American, can we replace Andrew Jackson on our money with Steve Irwin? We love him too,” one international fan tweeted.

“My day would be better and I’d have a good day seeing Steve smiling back at me,” commented another.

Meanwhile if a Sydneysider could have his way, he suggests updating the country’s coins to include The Wiggles on 50 cent pieces, AC/DC on 20 cent pieces and “Bunnings snags” on 5 cent pieces.

For those eager to show their support for Steve Irwin on the $5 note, Mr. Wu and Mr. Miles’ petitions are open for another 25 days and close at 12.59am on October 27."

An Australian police department was roasted for requesting civilian help spotting a suspect whose entire face is plastered with a massive “beast” tattoo.

“Murray River Police District are seeking assistance to locate wanted man Jaimes Sutton, who frequents the Deniliquin area on the VIC-NSW border,” the department wrote in a deadpan Facebook post, accompanied by Sutton’s scowling mugshot.

On the run after skipping a hearing on charges of domestic violence assault and property damage, Sutton blacked out his entire face in tattoo ink with the word “beast” scrawled across his forehead — and has a slew of other tats all over his body.

The plea got little sympathy — and a lot of sarcasm — from an incredulous public.

“I don’t think I’d recognize him if I passed him in the street,” one FB respondent joked.

“Keep your eyes open for this man. He’ll be extremely hard to spot in a crowd,” another snarked.

“I reckon he could wear a balaclava and we still could recognize him,” a woman added, referencing the outerwear that covers the entire head and face except for the eyes.

Others sarcastically inquired about more details to help identify him, like his height, clothing and eye color.

“I’m gonna need a description if you want my help to find him,” one FB user wrote.

Then there were the critics who mocked the quality, content — and font — of Sutton’s tats.

“It reminds me of doing a poster in primary school!” one poster wrote.

“Did this bloke pass out and get attacked by a sharpie?” yet another penned.

The weekly alert from the police — Warrant Wednesday — has been jokingly labeled “Tinder Day” by some female respondents, who have been known to tag each other in mock excitement over their “favorite day of the week” to find men.

Sutton proved particularly popular with women FB posters.

“I wonder who great looking guy will be up this week,” one wrote in anticipation of Warrant Wednesday, to which another woman later responded: “Check out James Sutton and his tasteful tatts!!!!”

There were some serious critics as well, ragging the police department itself.

“You need assistance to find a person with the word BEAST tattooed on his forehead?” one outraged citizen wrote.

“If they can’t find a bloke looking like this, they should be sacked!” another suggested."

Efforts to prevent military and veteran suicides have been hindered by a lack of accurate data and a failure to understand the root cause of the issue, with one study showing that the rate of suicide among veterans could be as much as 37% higher than the number reported by the Department of Veterans Affairs.

""There's no way we can combat veteran suicide without knowing what is causing it, where it's coming from, and the highest number,"" Jen Satterly, the co-founder and CEO of the All Secure Foundation, told Fox News Digital.

The All Secure Foundation has worked to help give current and former members of the military who are suffering from trauma and loss of resources guidance about mental health, traveling to multiple military installations across the country and hosting events aimed at bringing down the troublesome number of military suicides.

But their mission to fight for the men and women who have fought for their country faces many obstacles, including a lack of understanding of just how far-reaching the issue is.

VETERANS COMMITTING SUICIDE AT RATE 2 TIMES HIGHER THAN VA DATA SHOWS: STUDY

That obstacle came into greater focus after a recent study showed that the VA could be undercounting veteran suicides by over 30%, startling new information to some but no surprise to Satterly and her colleagues.

""Part of my advocacy in this arena of the veteran space has been trying to get accurate numbers and reporting,"" Satterly said. ""There has been a discrepancy in the numbers for years now, so this is actually no surprise to us in our organization.""

While the oft-cited ""22 a day"" number has been widely circulated since the release of a VA report on veteran suicides in 2014, Satterly pointed out that there were multiple flaws in the research. Overdose numbers were not being counted in the statistics, while communication between the various stakeholders has never been streamlined to provide a full accounting.

""It's very difficult,"" Satterly said. ""There is, as you can imagine, a level of privacy that families want to protect their loved ones. Oftentimes, I understand that a family might not want to come forward and say this was a death by suicide versus saying it was an accidental overdose.""

NORTH CAROLINA MURDER-SUICIDE OF ARMY VET, WIFE LEAVES QUIET COMMUNITY HEARTBROKEN

According to the authors of the study, which was dubbed Operation Deep Dive, there has also been a widespread failure to track former service members who took their own lives years after serving.

""The difference in the data is likely due to undercounting of FSMs' (former service members) deaths and the greater specificity of the decedent’s demographics, military experience, and death details available to Operation Deep Dive,"" the study said.

After compiling data in eight states, the researchers found that if the same trend were to hold nationwide, the actual rate of veteran suicides per day would be closer to 44.

""What we found is across the nation with the states is that they undercount veteran deaths by about 18%, which means someone who served in the military is not annotated as having served in the military 18% of the time,"" Jim Lorraine, president of America’s Warrior Partnership, the organization behind the study, told Fox News Digital. ""Inversely, the communities are counting people who never served in the military as service members 7% of the time so that's a combined error rate of 25%.""

LOCAL INDIANA ORGANIZATION HELPING TO STEM TIDE OF VETERAN SUICIDES WITH COMMUNITY-BUILDING

An effort to streamline the data and come to an accurate number could be a massive undertaking, Satterly noted, requiring an increase of funding and an overhaul of how departments share information. However, she noted the government has the ability to track the information, with every member of the military having a permanent record showing their branch, unit and years served.

""I think it starts with the DOD… we've got to stop hiding or minimizing what is happening,"" Satterly said.

Another issue is the failure to understand why current and former military members take their own lives.

""As we look at our Vietnam veterans who are now in their 70s… the issues can be very different for them now,"" Satterly said. ""They're battling a lot of physical ailments, cancer, a whole slew of things that are coming forward through Agent Orange and other exposures.""

""To understand why people are dying by suicide might look very different between different communities and different times served,"" Satterly said.

NORTH CAROLINA MURDER-SUICIDE OF ARMY VET, WIFE LEAVES COMMUNITY HEARTBROKEN

Satterly also pointed out that there is a misconception that most or all military suicides are the result of war trauma or a lack of purpose after service members take the uniform off when in reality there are other factors that could play an even larger role, such as an unstable home life, divorce and financial issues, all of which could come into play when a person decides to take their own life.

While those factors play a role in suicides for the general population, current and former service members are especially at risk. Due to the nature of their work, many of them have suffered from traumatic brain injuries or post-traumatic stress disorder, two issues that can make suicide a more likely outcome.

Satterly also pointed out that mental health remains a stigmatized issue within the military, with current and former service members not seeking help before a crisis deepens out of fear for appearing weak.

The All Secure Foundation has aimed to tackle that problem in its outreach to the military community, providing service members and veterans with the information and tools they need before issues spiral downward.

WHITE HOUSE ROLLS OUT STRATEGY TO REDUCE MILITARY, VETERAN SUICIDE, CALLING IT A 'NATIONAL SECURITY CRISIS'

""We spend our days going around to different posts and different bases trying to really break apart the stigma that they're facing,"" Satterly said.

The All Secure Foundation attempts to frame taking care of mental health as an issue of training, noting that military members are constantly trained to go to war but not for what comes after.

""You've been trained on how to shoot, move, communicate and medicate…. Who trained you to come home from war?"" Satterly said they ask service members. ""So now you realize you don't need to ask for help, you just need to ask for training… that takes a huge weight off of the stigma, I can handle this, I've been trained.""

But Satterly noted that the process for turning the situation around will take time, arguing previous generations ""rubbed dirt on"" the issue and didn't take it seriously.

""You have to treat it like an injury, so I believe what language we use is really critical moving forward,"" Satterly said. ""We don't say PTSD, we use PTSI, post-traumatic stress injury. Because we do know that you can see it through brain scans and that it can be healed. I think that takes a tremendous pressure off our service members, that it's not a matter of willpower, it's not a matter of weakness."""

MURRAY — Dede Minardi said there is a significant need for people to help care for abandoned animals, either through fostering or adopting.

""This year is ridiculous. There's just too many animals and not enough people,"" she said.

Minardi who works with CAWS, Community Animal Welfare Society, thinks the issue stemmed from the COVID-19 pandemic and an increase in people with pets who ended up not being able to care for them long-term. She said people will just leave animals — either outdoors or in — as they move out. A lot of the animals also need medical attention. She said they are doing the best they can right now with the resources they have.

On Saturday, CAWS and other organizations gathered at Wheeler Historic Farm in Murray for Petapalooza, where the goal was to adopt 150 pets into homes and have some fun with their pets.

Minardi said CAWS places about 1,300 cats and dogs with adopting families each year. She said they are the oldest and largest foster-based rescue in the state and help pets primarily in Salt Lake Valley. They have about 50 families caring for cats and more caring for dogs.

She encouraged people to adopt instead of buying pets, pointing out that any animal someone wants likely can be found in a shelter and will come already spayed or neutered and vaccinated, saving a future owner even more money. She also said when adopting from a rescue, there is more information available about how the animal acts in a home so a future pet owner can be better informed.

This year is ridiculous. There's just too many animals and not enough people. –Dede Minardi, Community Animal Welfare Society

Minardi cares for cats because she says they provide companionship and are easy to care for, especially compared to dogs. She did say people should get their cats spayed or neutered, which helps their health and the environment in addition to preventing an increase in stray cats.

CAWS always needs volunteers to foster pets, Minardi said. Fostering helps two animals, she said, bringing one into a home and another into its spot in the shelter, and it increases the chances of the animal being seen and adopted. It's also a good way to try out having a pet before buying it.

Callista Pearson with Salt Lake County Animal Services said this is the seventh time they held a Petapalooza, but that the turnout this time was larger than any other year.

Pearson said that during the pandemic a lot of pets got into homes, which at the time was good. However, because it was during a time period when veterinarian offices and pet trainers had limited availability or were closed, most of those pets did not get spayed or neutered or trained, leading to even more problems with the pets they currently have in the shelter.

She said they refer to some dogs as ""COVID puppies,"" which are now grown dogs who have behavioral issues and still need training.

One thing that is good about the Petapalooza event is people usually come with their dogs, which is important. Pearson says if you are going to adopt, the new pet has to meet other pets in the household first to make sure they will get along.

Salt Lake County Animal Services was hoping to help 150 pets find owners during Saturday's event, and at two hours in they had already facilitated adoptions for about 60 pets. Pearson said this event brings the public and pets together with shelters and rescues in a more positive environment.

West Valley Animal Services brought some pets, along with 12 rescue organizations, like CAWS, which house pets with foster volunteers.

Pearson said this year the number of pets that are coming in needing to be adopted has not slowed down, although it typically does by this time of year.

""Right now ... all the rescues are full,"" she said. ""There's just tons of animals.""

She said people who can't take care of their pets call daily, but there's just no room.

""For us, at our shelter, every animal going out, we have at least one more animal coming in,"" Pearson said. ""This will definitely help a lot.""

Pearson acknowledged times are tough and she understands caring for people should come first. To help families who are struggling to care for their pets, they do provide pet food once a month. There is also a foster care program for people who are between being homeless and having a home to give their pet a place to stay.

61ae27a1-61f8-48bd-86a0-47f42799c647,"A Newcastle woman says an Australian cruise company should have been better prepared for adverse weather after a holiday scuba dive in Fiji almost ended in disaster when a dive boat disappeared.

When Justine Clark and her sons Felix, 18, and Max, 20, surfaced from an offshore dive in Fiji on August 14, their dive boat was nowhere to be seen.

A diver with more than 30 years’ experience, Clark had booked an afternoon dive at an offshore site called The Supermarket.

Their dive party included an English tourist and the divemaster, who worked for Viti Water Sports, a company subcontracted by Captain Cook Cruises.

On the way to the dive site the weather had deteriorated, but the party pushed on.

“We travelled into an approaching storm and out in open waters in what appeared to be a large channel about 20 kilometres from any island,” Clark said.

After a regulation drift dive of about 40 minutes, she surfaced with her eldest son.

“No tender boat was visible on surfacing, the swell was two metres, it was dark with grey clouds and high wind,” Clark said.

She said their divemaster was next to the surface.

“He was shocked at the events and stated this had never happened in his 27 years of diving,” Clark said.

Garbage collector to the rescue

The divemaster advised the group to start swimming for an island they could see in the distance.

“I can’t impress how concerned I was for everyone’s health, sharks and the sense of determination I had to reach the island in a calm manner,” Clark said.

After about 50 minutes, the divemaster yelled that a small boat was travelling toward the group.

He advised the divers to inflate their surface marker buoys in a bid to be seen.

The group’s savior was a garbage collector who had been picking up rubbish in the ocean.

He had noticed the tip of one of the diver’s buoys.

Soon after, the tender boat driver motored over to the group.

“He apologized and told me he was so scared and he had radioed the captain that he lost us,” Clark said.

In a written response to the ABC, Captain Cook Cruises explained that the tender boat had blown away from the dive site and that surface conditions made it difficult for the operator to follow the divers’ bubbles.

The company said the situation was unprecedented and that a full internal review had been undertaken, resulting in “already tight” safety procedures being changed.

“I think it’s really important operators are prepared for those situations that may be rare but can still occur,” Clark said."
9ddfa585-c920-4461-8e51-b332587a0fbf,"PERTH, Australia (AP) — A man who may have been keeping a wild kangaroo as a pet was killed by the animal in southwest Australia, police said Tuesday. It was reportedly the first fatal attack by a kangaroo in Australia since 1936.

A relative found the 77-year-old man with “serious injuries” on his property Sunday in semirural Redmond, 400 kilometers (250 miles) southeast of the Western Australia state capital Perth.

It was believed he had been attacked earlier in the day by the kangaroo, which police shot dead because it was preventing paramedics from reaching the injured man, police said.

“The kangaroo was posing an ongoing threat to emergency responders,"" the statement said.

The man died at the scene. Police are preparing a report for a coroner who will record an official cause to death.

Police believe the victim had been keeping the wild kangaroo as a pet. There are legal restrictions on keeping Australian native fauna as pets.

Western gray kangaroos are common in Australia’s southwest. They can weigh up to 54 kilograms (119 pounds) and stand 1.3 meters (4 feet 3 inches) tall.

The males can be aggressive and fight people with the same techniques as they use with each other. They use their short upper limbs to grapple with their opponent, use their muscular tails to take their body weight, then lash out with both their powerful clawed hind legs.

In 1936, William Cruickshank, 38, died in a hospital in Hillston in New South Wales state on the Australian east coast months after he'd been attacked by a kangaroo.

Cruickshank suffered extensive head injuries including a broken jaw as he attempted to rescue his two dogs from a large kangaroo, The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper reported at the time."

The 28-year-old shocked onlookers on Saturday when she paraded around the luxury Melbourne boutique in only her underwear.

Ms. Peterson drenched her almost naked body and the store’s steps in red liquid as she preached to her stunned audience.

“Louis Vuitton murders cows, sheep, goats, crocodiles, snakes, foxes, minks, ducks, and geese. They murder baby lambs and turn their skin into leather jackets,” she yelled.

“Louis Vuitton has blood on their hands and so do you if you’re not vegan. The fur, leather, wool, down, scale, and silk industries abuse, torture, and murder animals,” she said.

“They fight for their lives until their very last breath in the name of fashion of clothing. We do not need to be contributing to this. If you’re not vegan, you’re an animal abuser,” said Peterson.

Ms. Peterson was eventually approached by security guards who asked her to leave the store.

She shared her excitement and nervousness on Instagram before she pulled off the audacious display.

“I am going in disguise to do a disruptive protest today inside Louis Vuitton as an anniversary since my first Louis Vuitton disruption exactly one year ago … which was by far my most powerful protest,” she said.

The vegan activist complied as security guards told her to leave the store. Tash Peterson/Facebook

“I’m incredibly nervous, but it’s going to be a f–king awesome and powerful protest.”

Saturday’s protest was a repeat of a stunt she pulled at a Perth Louis Vuitton store at this time last year.

On that occasion, Ms. Peterson also walked around the store in only a G-string and covered her body in red liquid.

“Who was murdered for your leather bag, down jacket, and woolen jumper,” she shouted at Perth shoppers

“Animals are not clothing, they’re not food, entertainment, commodities, machines, or objects.

She also held up a placard that read: “I would rather be naked than wear someone else’s skin.”

Ms. Peterson later claimed the red liquid she used contained her own menstrual blood.

“I am using my body and blood to help those who have no autonomy over their bodies,” she said after the incident.

“I used my period blood to cover my naked body in this protest to symbolize the bloodshed of the animal holocaust and the ingrained anthropocentrism in our society.”

It is not known what was contained in the liquid she used on Saturday.

Victoria Police confirmed they attended the Melbourne store in response to the protest, but Ms. Peterson was not charged with any offense.

“Police attended a boutique in Melbourne’s CBD on Aug. 20 after a woman threw red liquid inside the premises,” a police spokesperson said,

“Officers were called to the Collins St store about 11:45 p.m. EST where staff requested the woman to leave after she threw the red liquid on the floor.

“The woman complied and left the store.

“No offense was detected.”

Ms. Peterson made the move from Perth to Melbourne earlier this year after she was banned from all licensed venues across Western Australia for what she described as a “nonviolent protest”.

“I would rather be naked than wear someone else’s skin,” said Tash Peterson. Tash Peterson/Facebook

She also recently said she was charged with three criminal offenses for a protest she did in Perth in June.

Ms. Peterson said she was on the “wrong side of the law” but the “right side of history”.

“I have received a prosecution notice and summons to court for three criminal offenses for one protest that I did in June,” she posted to Instagram on Tuesday.

“Two charges of trespass in Outback Jack’s and Old Shanghai in Northbridge and one charge of disorderly conduct as a result of raising awareness about the animal holocaust in the meat, dairy, and egg industries.

“I currently have a criminal record of three convictions as a result of my activism and will be appealing two convictions of disorderly conduct in the Supreme Court this September,” Ms. Peterson said."

A popular TikTok and OnlyFans star had her Perth event shut down by police due to crowd chaos.

Anna Paul, 23, has been touring the country as part of her collaboration with activewear brand STAX.

But during the fan meet-and-greet event at Perth’s Hay Street Mall on Sunday chaos erupted with a massive crowd of teenagers flocking to see the star.

Organizers expected 200-300 people to attend, but a significantly larger crowd showed up.

Police said they were forced to act after tensions began to boil over among the crowd and queue jumping led to several people collapsing and needing medical assistance.

Footage posted to TikTok shows the fans waiting outside chanting. Police can be seen trying to disperse them.

“Due to the size of the crowd and lack of appropriate security and other event planning in place to cope with the larger than expected crowd, and in consultation with the store management, the event was closed down and police commenced dispersing the crowd from the area,” a police spokesman said.

Fans were seen lining up for the event at 8 a.m.

One person claimed fans had camped overnight to meet the star.

“I got there at 2 a.m. and got to see her but only for a split second and barely could say anything but still very grateful. So sad it got canceled,” one said.

The Queenslander, who has over five million TikTok fans and two million on Instagram, posted to social media apologizing for the event being canceled and saying she’d tried to work with police to control it.

4376121e-67ab-481f-b6af-66f0f712e7a3,"A nightclub in Sydney, Australia, has banned staring at other patrons, threatening violators with a call to law enforcement.

Club 77 published Its new safety and harassment policy on its site, which explicitly states that patrons must get consent to stare “at someone from afar.” To enforce this new policy, the club will designate one security guard as a “safety officer” every night, identifiable by a pink high-visibility vest, the policy states.

The club developed the new rule in the hopes of remaining a “safe space” after it had recently “attracted some people who do not share our values and ethics when it comes to club culture,” according to the New York Post. Violators will have the police called on them for “harassment,” according to the statement.

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Club 77 (@club77sydney)

The club announced the rule in a lengthy Instagram post in early August and was met with mixed reactions in the comments. Many commenters appeared to appreciate the rule update, sharing heart emojis and saying “thank you” to the establishment.

Others were less enthused, with one writing “RIP to social interaction. Everything is becoming social media IRL.” Another commented, “never before has the term go woke go broke been more appropriate.” (RELATED: Bouncer In Crimea Jailed For Having Sex With Random Woman In Front Of Nightclub Patrons)

A failure to do so could result in the police being called.

It also discouraged people from coming if their “sole purpose” was to meet someone to “pick up”.

Club 77 in Darlinghurst, in Sydney’s inner east, gave staring as an example of an action that would be in contravention of its new safety and harassment policy.

In an Instagram post from earlier this month, the club said “safety officers” in pink vests would enforce the staring rules.

Staring and picking up

Club 77 said it wanted to remain a “safe space” and so had updated its rules because it had recently, “attracted some people who do not share our values and ethics when it comes to club culture”.

“Creating a safe space goes beyond implementing practices to deal with incidents after they have happened.

Sydney’s “Club 77” says it wants to be a safe space. @max_mm1.

“We also have an obligation to educate new club-goers and help them understand what is considered unacceptable behaviour inside the venue and on the dance floor.”

In its policy the venue stated that “Club 77 is not a place to come to if your sole purpose is to ‘pick up’”.

It added that if, “you do come in and are approaching multiple people or giving unwanted attention to someone, you are going to attract the attention of our security, who have been instructed to stop this kind of behaviour”.

The venue’s policy, first reported by the Daily Telegraph, said it encouraged people to “interact with strangers” but “any engagement MUST begin with verbal consent”.

Staring was highlighted as one form of harassment.

Where the line was between innocently trying to make eye contact and staring was not fully explained.

But it was suggested that simply if the person being glanced at took offence, the clubber looking in their direction could be kicked out.

“If you are, for example, staring at someone from afar – if the attention you are giving someone is unwanted, that is considered harassment.

“If you’re being harassed by another person or receiving unwanted attention, please seek them out or tell our staff immediately.

The club said that safety officers in pink vests would enforce the new rules. @max_mm1.

“We adopt a policy of ‘always believe the report’ in cases of harassment and feeling unsafe.

“If we receive reports of any behaviour that has made someone feel uncomfortable, the reported individual will be removed from the venue and the police will be called,” the policy sated.

Those who replied to the post on social media largely gave it their support.

“Backing this 100 per cent,” said one.

“Amazing!!! Positive party culture all the way!” said another.

Club co-owner Dan Gorrel told The Daily Telegraph no one had been ejected from the club for staring as of yet, but he wanted to lay the ground rules as the club was becoming increasingly popular with young people.

“Someone could stare at someone and make them feel uncomfortable, they could be staring at them for quite some time.

“People want to go out, they want to feel safe, they don’t want people chasing after them, the response to it has been extremely positive.”"

Horrifying details have emerged of the moment Lametta Fadlallah and hairdresser friend Amy Hazouri were gunned down inside a car in Panania a town in Sydney, Australia Saturday night.

Fadlallah, 48 — a mother with reported links to organized crime — and Hazouri, 39, were both killed shortly before 9 pm when a hail of bullets struck their car, parked outside Fadallah’s house.

Fadlallah was pronounced dead at the scene of the attack. Hazouri died later after being rushed to Liverpool Hospital.

The Daily Telegraph revealed the 16-year-old girl in the front seat had never met Fadlallah and was simply at the house with her friend to pick up. Hazouri, who herself is believed to be an innocent victim of the shooting.

A relative of the young girl said she is so traumatized she cannot return to school and is now undergoing “intensive therapy”. She is now reportedly unable to eat and “hasn’t stopped crying, and can’t sleep”.

“She screamed at her friend ‘just drive, drive, drive, get away’,” the relative said, revealing they sped away for about a kilometer before calling for help.

When questioned about what could come next, former NSW Detective Peter Moroney told Today: “Sit down and hold on.”

He warned of retaliation “not like we’ve ever seen in Sydney before” if it turned out the shooting was connected to current gang warfare in the city.

“If you are to unpack what actually happened — for someone to know where she was, they obviously would have had to survey her for a point of time,” Det. Moroney said on Monday.

“They have sat and waited for her to sit within that vehicle before they came and then opened fire at close range.

“As I’ve seen (in) the footage there’s a volume of shots, someone clearly wanted her dead. They shot her in the manner in which they did. They didn’t care who was with her.”

Moroney said he counted 16 to 17 shots, fired in quick succession.

“It was a planned murder, an assassination really, and it’s happened in a public street in Sydney,” Superintendent Danny Doherty

He said “the calculation and the brutality” of the shooting would have police concerned.

“It was a planned murder, an assassination really, and it’s happened in a public street in Sydney,” Homicide Squad Commander Detective Superintendent Danny Doherty said.

“It’s unacceptable by any standards. It’s unprecedented, really. And we are determined to get the answers for the family.”

Emergency services were called to Weston Street in Revesby at about 8:50 pm on Saturday night following reports of a shooting.

Police believe the shooting occurred in Hendy St. in Panania before the driver of the 4WD sped away towards Revesby before he stopped and called the emergency services.

Superintendent Doherty blasted underworld figures for breaking the “unwritten laws” that protected women and children from attacks.

“I think this just demonstrated how low they‘ve got where any person that may be associated with someone who they want to target … they don’t discriminate, whether you’re male or female,“ he said.

“The rule books have been thrown out the window.”

Strike Force Laurantus has been established to investigate the incident, involving officers from the Homicide Squad, Bankstown Police Area Command and the South West Metropolitan Region.

Mark Green, aged 44, was recruited to a job in Australia for his specialist solar installation skills. He arrived in the country in 2012 from Scotland with his wife Kelly Green, 45, and their 19-year-old daughter Rebecca. The family have lived in the country continuously since.

But today at 10pm they are being sent home, after Mr Green's employer left them stranded without visas. The Greens initially moved to Australia after Mr Green's employer reportedly promised to sponsor their permanent residency. But according to the Daily Mail, every time the electrical specialist has been eligible, the employers have folded before the paperwork could be completed. Relocating to the UK has cost the family $60,000.

""And now we're having to sell it all, to go back to Scotland, to try and apply to come back again, to restart again. For the third time. ""I'm nearly 50. We can't go through this anymore. ""There's nothing for us back in Scotland now."" He added: ""This is where I live. This is where my heart is. ""It'll never change. Even if I go back to Scotland, here is where I will class as home.""

The decision has faced controversy, as a Tamilese family were granted permanent residency just a few days earlier. The Murugappan family were granted permanent residency on Friday by immigration minister Andrew Giles, allowing them to star in Biloela in Queensland. Earlier this morning, he was criticised by Australian radio host Ben Fordham for ""hypocrisy"". Speaking on the 2GB radio station, Mr Fordham said: ""Don’t ignore the double standard here – the minister is happy to show compassion when there’s enough publicity for him to look like a hero. ""He’ll step in to help one family but allow another to be kicked out of Australia.

The family has already spent upwards of $150,000 on immigration lawyers"
