The co-founder of a prominent cryptocurrency firm has died “unexpectedly” aged 30. Tiantian Kullander, a former Morgan Stanley trader who helped found the digital asset company the Amber Group, “passed away unexpectedly in his sleep” on Wednesday.

In a statement posted to company’s website, the firm said the news came with “the deepest sadness and a heavy heart”. Also known as “TT”, he was described as a “devoted husband, a loving father and a fierce friend”. The statement continued: “His passing is a tragedy and our thoughts and prayers are with his family. “He is survived by his wife and their beloved son.

Mr Kullander was lauded as a 'pioneer'

“We kindly request that you respect their privacy during this difficult time.” Back in 2019, Mr Kullander made the Forbes 30 Under 30 list, and the Amber Group was most recently valued at $3 billion. The statement hailed Mr Kullander as ""instrumental to the founding of Amber and a pillar of our success"", praising his work as a ""respected thought leader"" who was ""widely recognized as a pioneer for the industry"". It continued: ""He put his heart and soul into the company, in every stage of its growth. READ MORE: Russian official staggeringly admits 'we have no socks, shorts, doctor

Mr Kullander was part of the team that founded the Hong Kong-based firm back in 2017

""We lost a great partner and a true friend in TT and words cannot express our sorrow at this time. ""TT’s legacy will live on and we will work even harder to make Amber the category-defining leader of our industry, as this was TT’s ambition and dream.""

Imagine you put on an old coat you haven’t worn in a while, and to your surprise find a crumpled $20 bill in your pocket. How good does it feel? Do you go up half a notch on a one to ten mood scale, or maybe a full notch?

Let’s imagine a different scenario. You’re buying ice cream from an ice cream cart, and take out a $20 bill to pay. Suddenly, a gust of wind sweeps it from your hand and into a nearby sewer grate. What does that do to your mood on the one-to-ten scale?

If you’re like most people, you feel much worse over losing $20 than about gaining $20. That tendency is called loss aversion, one among many dangerous judgment errors that behavioral scientists call cognitive biases.

Loss aversion is one of the three key reasons why our minds get sucked - and suckered - into Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales. Retailers know that our intuitive reaction is to avoid losses, with research showing this drive might be up to twice as powerful as the desire to make gains. By offering short-term sales, available only on Black Friday or Cyber Monday, they tap into our deep intuition to protect ourselves from the loss of the opportunity represented by the sale.

BLACK FRIDAY: A BRIEF HISTORY AND LITTLE KNOWN FACTS

Let’s imagine a different scenario. It’s Cyber Monday, and you decided to check out the deals on an e-commerce website. You go there, feeling confident you’ll only get one or two of the best deals.

But once you visit the website, you’re hooked. All those deals look great, with the prices so much lower than usual. You can’t pass them up! So you end up taking advantage of a bunch of deals, and purchase much more than you intended to in the first place.

Why did that happen? Why couldn’t you control yourself? It’s due to a cognitive bias called the restraint bias.

We substantially overestimate the extent to which we can restrain our impulses. In other words, we have less self-control and weaker willpower than we like to think we do.

The final key psychological reason for why you get sucked into Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales is because you’re reading this article. Here’s the thing: the abundance of news stories, advertisements, and social media posts around Black Friday and Cyber Monday makes it seem like everyone is thinking about sales on those days and looking for good deals.

As a consequence, our minds drive us to jump on the bandwagon of getting into Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales, a tendency that scientists call the bandwagon effect. When we perceive other people aligning around something, we are predisposed to join them. After all, they wouldn’t be doing it if it wasn’t a good idea, right?

Loss aversion, restraint bias, and the bandwagon effect are mental blindspots that impact decision-making in all life areas, ranging from the future of work to mental fitness. By knowing about them, you can work to notice and address these problems.

For example, a useful strategy for Black Friday and Cyber Monday involves deciding in advance the purchases you’d like to make if they are on sale and buying them online instead of in the store. For example, you might decide to buy a certain laptop if it’s more than 20 percent off, or a specific big-screen TV if it’s 30 percent off. Save the website pages of the laptop or TV that you want to buy, and then visit them on Black Friday and Cyber Monday to see if they’re on sale. If they’re not, be disciplined, and don’t buy something else, as you’re likely to get stuck buying much more than you wanted. Instead, wait for the Christmas sale."

Taking on a side hustle can generate vital spending money as inflation rages. Some can even change lives.

Woman makes ‘equal to earnings’ of old job in online side hustle

Karen Golder, a trained teacher, was forced to reduce her hours to look after daughter Imogen, 18, who has rare seizure-causing disorder Rasmussen’s Encephalitis.

The 49-year-old mum-of-two worked two days a week as a special educational needs coordinator in a primary school, while husband Murray is a painter and decorator. Son Jed, 20, is at university.

As living costs rocket, finding an extra source of family income became essential, and Karen turned to direct selling.

Now she tops up her salary by earning £500 to £600 a month with The Body Shop At Home. It sells ethically produced “skincare, haircare, bath & body and self-love” products, either online or in store, by independent consultants such as Karen.

Seven out of 10 consultants have another full-time or part-time job and Karen said: “It is so much more than a side hustle, it’s been lifesaving for me.”

She admits that sounds dramatic but adds: ""It means I'm finally doing something for me."""
1445cd8a-8a18-4dc5-af77-32ef3fed8800,"Michael Barr, the Federal Reserve's top financial regulatory official, on Tuesday said he is concerned about risks from the non-bank sector, including cryptocurrencies, for which the U.S. central bank and other regulators have poor visibility.

""We're concerned about the risks that we don't know about in the non-bank sector,"" Barr said in response to a question during an appearance before the Senate Banking Committee. ""That includes obviously crypto activity, but more broadly risks in parts of the financial system where we don't have good visibility, we don't have good transparency, we don't have good data. That can create risks that blow back to the financial system that we do regulate.""

Barr's remarks came in his first congressional testimony since becoming the Fed's top Wall Street cop over the summer and augmented his prepared comments to the committee that he was keeping a close eye for stresses in the financial system amid a weakening economy. He had also signaled stiffer oversight of the cryptocurrency arena is in the offing, an issue that has taken on added urgency with the collapse last week of crypto-exchange FTX.

Recent events in crypto markets, Barr said in his written testimony, ""while mostly occurring outside the banking sector, have highlighted the risks to investors and consumers associated with new and novel asset classes and activities when not accompanied by strong guardrails.""

""We do not want to stifle innovation, but when regulation is lax or behind the curve, it can facilitate risk taking and a race to the bottom that puts consumers, businesses, and the economy in danger and discredits new products and services with consumers and investors.""

Barr and other top regulators from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency appearing before the committee were pressed by Senator Patrick Toomey, the panel's ranking Republican, for why they have not issued guidance to banks about forming relationships, such as custody services, with crypto firms that could foster greater oversight of the sector.

Toomey voiced concern that the Fed was signaling it may issue guidance to banks wishing to provide custody services for crypto assets to place those assets on their own balance sheets, which would increase their capital requirements. Banks are not required to place other types of custody assets on their own balance sheets.

""Wouldn't this impose a significant cost on banks if they are in fact obligated to put all of the ... crypto custody assets on their balance sheets,"" Toomey asked Barr.

""We've seen banks operate in a pretty cautious way to date. There are very few institutions that are currently seeking to engage in custody activity,"" Barr said. He said it was his understanding of recent Securities and Exchange Commission accounting interpretations for publicly traded banks that they would need to hold capital against crypto assets held in custody in a way they would not need to for traditional custody assets.

""So that differential would impact bank decision making,"" he said."

Estimated read time: 2-3 minutes

NEW YORK — Twitter's new owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk sold nearly $4 billion worth of Tesla shares, according to regulatory filings.

Musk, who bought Twitter for $44 billion, sold 19.5 million shares of the electric car company from Nov. 4 to Nov. 8, according to Tuesday's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

He sold $7 billion of his Tesla stock in August as he worked to finance the Twitter purchase he was trying to get out of at the time. In all, Musk has sold more than $19 billion worth of Tesla stock since April, including those in Tuesday's filings, likely to fund his share of the Twitter purchase.

The takeover of Twitter has not been smooth and the social media platform has seen the exodus of some big advertisers in recent weeks in including United Airlines, General Motors, REI, General Mills and Audi.

Musk acknowledged ""a massive drop in revenue"" at Twitter, which heavily relies on advertising to make money.

Musk had signaled that he was done selling Tesla shares and the revelation that those sales continue left some industry analysts exasperated.

""Our fear heading into the final days of the deal was that Musk was going to be forced to sell more Tesla stock to fund the disaster Twitter deal and ultimately those fears came true which speaks to some of the massive selling pressures on the stock of late,"" wrote Daniel Ives at Wedbush. ""For Musk who multiple times over the past year has said he is 'done selling Tesla stock' yet again loses more credibility with investors and his loyalists in a boy who cried wolf moment.""

Most of Musk's wealth is tied up in shares of Tesla Inc. On Tuesday, his personal net worth dropped below $200 billion, according to Forbes, but he is still the world's richest person.

Musk had lined up banks including Morgan Stanley to help finance the Twitter deal. His original share of the deal was about $15.5 billion, Ives estimated. But if equity investors dropped out, Musk would be on the hook to replace them or throw in more of his own money.

""The Twitter circus show has been an absolute debacle from all angles since Musk bought the platform for all the world to see: from the 50% layoffs and then bringing back some workers, to the head-scratching verification roll-out to users which many are pushing back on, to the constant tweeting in this political firestorm backdrop, and now.....selling more TSLA stock,"" Ives wrote. ""When does it end?""

Shares of Tesla Inc., which were flat before the opening bell Wednesday, have fallen 8% this week and are down 46% this year, far outpacing broader market declines in what has been a dreadful year for investors.

4d3765e3-712e-4d9b-991a-01884499d71f,"In the wake of Washington Commanders owner Dan Snyder taking the first step at a potential sale of his franchise, Hall of Fame wide receiver Michael Irvin has a prediction as to who will buy it: Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.

Irvin’s prediction comes after he saw Bezos sitting next to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell while watching the Kansas City Chiefs play the Los Angeles Chargers in September. Bezos’ Amazon Prime Video is the new home of ""Thursday Night Football.""

""When I saw that first ‘Thursday Night Football’ game, and I saw Roger Goodell sitting over there with Jeff Bezos, I said, ‘Oh, God. Somebody’s got to give up their team. Somebody’s got to give up their team because you know Bezos is going to try.' That was just my thought,"" Irvin told Fox News Digital while promoting TradeZing, a live-streaming, social engagement, Web3 platform designed for investors, which just announced its closed beta.

Now there’s a report from TMZ Sports that Bezos and Jay-Z could partner to buy the Commanders, while the Washington Post reported that Bezos is looking into the bid.

While that prediction might come to fruition, Irvin went a step further.

He says once Bezos takes over in Washington, future Hall of Fame quarterback Aaron Rodgers of the Green Bay Packers will eventually be wearing the burgundy and gold.

Irvin believes the Packers are slowly trying to move on from Rodgers, who is having a tough time working through a young offense that is struggling. Green Bay has lost four straight games.

Rodgers signed a three-year, $150 million contract with the Packers that won’t make him a free agent until the 2025 season. It’s also extremely backloaded, making him a $40 million cap hit in 2024, $59 million in 2025 and a potential $53 million hit in 2026 if an option is exercised.

COMMANDERS' DAN SNYDER HIRES BANK IN FIRST STEP TOWARD POSSIBLE TEAM SALE

However, Irvin points out teams like the Seattle Seahawks, who have found much success this season post-Russell Wilson with Geno Smith under center. For that reason, he thinks the Packers are viewing that situation and believing they can have someone work well in their system without Rodgers, despite him being one of the best quarterbacks of all time as well as the most recent NFL MVP.

With that in mind, Bezos might want to go after someone who will quickly change the narrative around Washington and his front office and figure out the financials accordingly.

""I see them wanting to get Aaron Rodgers out of [Green Bay],"" Irving explained. ""On the other side, I see Jeff Bezos about to get Washington. I said, ‘Michael, I hope this day comes in any way to fruition where Bezos gets Washington and buys the team. Sooner or later, he works out some deal, they get Aaron Rodgers coming over to Washington.’ Give it a year or two, Aaron will be in Washington.""

Irvin did add that he would love a team with majority Black ownership in the NFL, something ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith suggested upon the news that Snyder hired Bank of America Securities for a potential sale.

""It is far time that it has happened in the National Football League,"" Smith said on ""First Take."" ""Over 65% of its players are Black. Obviously, we understand that. We recognize that it’s the most popular sport in North America. We get all of that as well. We know how big-time the NFL is. You’re talking about it being worth billions upon billions of dollars, and there are enough Black folks with deep pockets who would love to be a part of the cash cow that is the National Football league. This is an opportunity for them to do it.""

To that point, Irvin added, ""That would be great. That would be great, and we’ve talked about a lot of things and inclusiveness and diversity within the NFL. That would be a hell of a sign if that was to happen. That would be a great thing if that was to happen. But it’s not.""

AARON RODGERS ATTEMPTS TO CLARIFY HIS COMMENTS ON THE PACKERS' OFFENSIVE STRUGGLES

Irvin knows the NFL doesn’t have to check the bank statements of Bezos, as he is the fourth-richest person in the world with an estimated net worth of $126 billion. At the end of the day, he’s just connecting the dots he’s been seeing unfold in this situation.

""My job is to look at situations, analyze and try to share with people even before they happen sometimes. I’m just analyzing,"" he said.

Irvin is an investor and board member of TradeZing, a platform that is targeted at millennial and Gen Z investors who are learning the ever-evolving world of stocks, cryptocurrency and more.

""We’re giving people the opportunity to come together, to engage each other, exchange information. There’s a lot of information that’s getting out and coming out fast. There’s a lot of opportunities — everyone’s talking NFTs, crypto, all of these things. It can make your head spin,"" Irvin said.

fef34ca0-ebe1-4236-b4a5-07e8da5602d8,"More money than sense?

A TikToker is dividing the internet after sharing the controversial money rules he followed in order to amass a fortune.

Charlie Ehlers, a 28-year-old “stock investor” from Australia, says he saved more than $200,000 by the time he turned 26 — thanks to ideas such as avoiding going to college unless you know what you want to do or buying a home unless it was for an investment.

“Here are some money rules I follow as someone in my 20s who has been investing for 10 years now,” Ehlers stated in the viral video, which has clocked up more than 675,000 views.

The finance guru took to TikTok to reveal his rules for riches. The clip quickly clocked up more than 675,000 views. charlieehlers/TikTok

Ehlers initially started off his TikTok clip by outlining less controversial rules that helped him to curb spending on clothes, alcohol and food delivery.

“[Don’t buy] designer clothing brands and labels,” the TikToker advised, saying fashion houses such as Louis Vuitton and Gucci “specifically target broke people who want to look rich.”

His rulebook also outlawed excess spending on alcohol and services such as Uber Eats.

“If you’re someone who will go out and spend $150 to $200 on drinks but you complain about fuel prices and rent prices and interest rates, you’re idiotic,” he scolded, encouraging people to “pre-drink” at home before going out to bars with friends.

Then, Ehlers admitted that his rules were going to get a little more “controversial.”

First, he urged viewers not to go to college — unless they were absolutely sure they needed a specific degree to attain their dream profession.

“Too many people go into debt to get a degree that they don’t use,” he declared. “If you’re getting a degree, [only] do it because you want to be in that profession.”

Second, Ehlers urged viewers to avoid buying a home unless it could be used as an investment.

“Don’t buy a home,” the guru implored. “Unless you’ve sat down and gone through all the numbers of what it costs to run and own a home, you’re not allowed to comment on that point.

“I would personally buy a home if I could turn it into a cash-flowing asset, which most don’t because a home purchase is usually a lifestyle choice. It’s an emotional decision,” he further explained. “I would buy a home if I had a family and we wanted a specific place for a very specific reason. But to build wealth, buying a home to live in is not the answer.”

The rules divided TikTokers — with many taking issue with the guidelines surrounding home buying. Getty Images/EyeEm

Meanwhile, another of Ehler’s eyebrow-raising rules revolved around “investing in good bedding.”

“Seriously, you spend one-third of your life in bed, and your sleep has the biggest impact on your health, so buy good bedding,” he stated.

The controversial list of rules attracted thousands of comments from viewers, who had mixed reactions.

“Literally not wrong on any of this! Make smart choices,” one declared, before others chimed in with less enthusiastic responses.

“I agree with everything but the home,” one wrote. “Buying a home can be one of if not THE most effective way to build wealth.”"
7bd60643-ca3f-46aa-8436-3ff7b4cea5cb,"George Bernard Shaw famously said that there are three types of economists. There are those who are brilliantly right. There are those who are brilliantly wrong. And then there are those who teach.

Judging by his time at Princeton, there can be no question that Ben Bernanke is a brilliant academic economist. His pioneering work on the banking system taught us how bank failures deepened and prolonged the 1930s Great Depression. It was in recognition of this work that the Swedish central bank just awarded Bernanke, along with Douglas Diamond and Philip Dybvig, this year’s Nobel Prize in Economics.

Judging by Bernanke’s policy record during his long tenure at the Federal Reserve, though, one has to wonder whether he might not fall into Shaw’s category of brilliantly wrong economists. While at the central bank, first between 2002 and 2005 when he served on Alan Greenspan’s Fed board and then as Fed chair between 2006 and 2014, Bernanke made serious policy mistakes for which the country has paid dearly.

In his time on Greenspan’s Fed, Ben Bernanke was not known for voicing objections to the creation of the country’s greatest housing market and credit bubble on record by years of unduly easy monetary policy and regulatory neglect. The bursting of that bubble eventually led to the 2008-2009 Great Recession that saw unemployment reach 14%.

In March 2006, when problems came to the surface in the sub-prime mortgage market, Bernanke confidently assured us that this was a minor problem of no great consequence. Equally troubling, as minutes of the Fed’s August 2008 policy meeting reveal, the bank was blissfully unaware of the likely economic consequences of the imminent September 2008 Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. That bankruptcy was to plunge the US and world economies into their worst postwar recession up until then.

An even more troubling legacy of Bernanke’s tenure at the Fed was the massive resort to quantitative easing (QE) as an unorthodox way to jumpstart the economy once interest rates had reached their zero lower-bound. Under Bernanke’s leadership, the Fed engaged in three rounds of ultra-large-scale purchases of US Treasury Bonds and mortgage-backed securities. The net result was that whereas it took the Federal Reserve around 100 years after its creation to increase the size of the Fed’s balance sheet by $800 billion, it took Bernanke’s Fed barely six years to increase the Fed’s balance sheet by almost $4 trillion.

To be fair, in the depths of the Lehman crisis, Bernanke’s first round of QE most likely was the right policy response. It is dubious, however, whether the country needed another two rounds of QE on anything like their actual scale when the economy was well on its way to recovery. This would seem to be especially the case when one considers how large-scale QE distorts asset and credit market prices.

Since Bernanke left the bank, the Jerome Powell Fed has taken QE to new heights. In barely 18 months after the March 2020 COVID economic recession, Powell increased the Fed’s balance sheet by yet another staggering $5 trillion. In the process, he, along with the world’s other major central banks, helped create today’s world of multi-decade-high inflation and a global “everything” asset and credit market bubble.

The jury is still out as to how badly this will end for the US and world economies, when central banks now have to aggressively raise interest rates to regain control over inflation.

Since its establishment in 1968, with seemingly good reason the Nobel Prize in Economics had not been awarded to an economic policymaker. It is unfortunate that the Swedish central bank has chosen to depart from that tradition and make someone with as questionable an economic policy record as Ben Bernanke this year’s winner of the prize. It would be even more unfortunate if this award is seen as a ringing endorsement by the Nobel Committee of large-scale QE as a standard instrument of monetary policy.

Desmond Lachman is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. He was a deputy director in the International Monetary Fund’s Policy Development and Review Department and the chief emerging market economic strategist at Salomon Smith Barney."
020d116b-6e3a-4748-9178-7ffeb62ffb0e,"Ouch: The Nobel Prize in Economics for former Fed chief Ben Bernanke may be one of the worst calls ever.

Our issue isn’t Bernanke’s actions during the 2008 financial crisis, or even his folly in paving the way to the mortgage meltdown. It’s his re-launch of “Quantitative Easing” in 2010 (with enthusiastic support from his then No. 2 and later successor, Janet Yellen — now Treasury secretary).

You can absolutely defend the Fed’s tossing of the rules in 2008, but not the return to “printing money” two years later simply because the economy wasn’t recovering as fast as Bernanke wanted.

Obama-era federal-spending blowouts, tax hikes and regulatory clampdowns were the real burdens on private-sector growth, and Bernanke’s easy-money policies couldn’t shift that. They barely nudged employment up — but created long-lasting asset-price bubbles that put Wall Street in overdrive while Main Street remained stuck in the doldrums.

Worse, the Fed kept it up under Yellen, and when Jerome Powell took over and started rolling back the trillions in QE in 2019, the financial system began to freeze up again — forcing the Fed to back off.

Then came the COVID lockdowns, and trillions more in emergency QE. Now the Fed’s trying again, as consumer inflation soars. But that necessary action is threatening to tank the US economy (Biden’s return to Obama policies doesn’t help), and a bond-market panic like the UK just saw might yet tie the Fed’s hands and leave it helpless against inflation.

Even if you credit Bernanke with working miracles in 2008, his later actions messed the nation up for decades."
39534c07-ea09-43bd-b7e3-a01942080a80,"Chicago Federal Reserve President Charles Evans reiterated Monday that the fight against inflation is the Fed’s most important mission — even if that effort causes a major rise in US unemployment.

Evans argued that any uptick in unemployment would be a painful but necessary side effect as the Fed aims to lower prices by tightening monetary policy. The central bank has hiked its benchmark interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point at three straight meetings.

“Ultimately, inflation is the most important thing to get under control. That’s job one,” Evans said during a Monday appearance on CNBC’s “Squawk On The Street.” “Price stability sets the stage for stronger growth in the future.”

“If unemployment goes up at all, that’s unfortunate. If it goes up a lot, that’s really very difficult,” Evans added. “But price stability makes the future better.”

The Chicago Fed president’s remarks were the latest indication that policymakers aren’t backing off their hawkish approach to inflation. That’s despite mounting fears among investors that the Fed’s rate hikes will go too far and tip the US economy into a lengthy recession.

Evans is a non-voting member of the rate-making Federal Open Market Committee. He is expected to exit that role in 2023.

Last week, the September jobs report showed the US labor market added 263,000 jobs in September. The national unemployment sank to a five-decade low of just 3.5% — a data point widely taken as an indication that the Fed will continue to sharply hike rates.

Investors are currently pricing in a 78.4% probability that the Fed will enact yet another three-quarter-point hike at its next meeting in November, with just a 21.6% probability of a more modest half-point hike, according to CME Group data.

While Fed Chair Jerome Powell previously warned that rate hikes would result in “some pain” for US households in the form of layoffs, the central bank’s current projection calls for the median unemployment rate will rise no higher than 4.4% through 2025.

Meanwhile, ex-Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, a prominent Fed critic, asserted last week that unemployment will likely need to hit 6% for the Fed’s policy stance to properly address inflation."
86111a82-c50a-4fc0-aa00-eb707c00427b,"Famed investor Michael Burry delivered arguably his most dire warning about the current US economy to date late Thursday – suggesting he is concerned the ongoing downturn could be worse than the Great Recession.

Burry, the boss of Scion Asset Management, noted that one of his market analysts said his comments were “spooky” because he voiced his concerns on Sept. 29 – the anniversary of a 777.68-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2008 that ranked at the time as the largest single-day plunge in history.

“Today I wondered aloud if this could be worse than 2008,” Burry said in a now-deleted tweet. “What interest rates are doing, exchange rates globally, central banks seem reactionary and in [cover your a–] mode.”

The Dow had plummeted nearly 500 points before Burry’s tweet and has pared more than 20% from its high of nearly 37,000 — putting it into bear market territory. It was down nearly 100 as of 1 p.m. Friday.

The Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world have scrambled to hike interest rates in recent months in a bid to tame decades-high inflation. The World Bank and others have warned that central banks risk causing a global recession while pushing forward with rapid, simultaneous rate hikes despite signs of slowing economies.

Burry, whose bet against the US housing market was made famous in the 2015 film “The Big Short,” is one of several prominent voices warning of potentially dangerous global economic conditions.

Earlier this week, ex-Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, a frequent critic of the Fed’s delayed response to inflation, warned that global economic risk levels are similar to those seen in 2007 ahead of the Great Recession.

“In the same way that people became anxious in August of 2007, I think this is a moment when there should be increased anxiety,” Summers told Bloomberg.

Like Burry, Summers noted that there is widespread uncertainty about the policy actions of central banks as they attempt to stabilize economies.

The Bank of England was forced to intervene this week after the value of the British pound crashed to an all-time low. Investors were rattled after the UK government backed sweeping unfunded tax cuts and increased spending — a plan that sparked fears of even worse inflation.

Burry has amassed more than 1 million followers on Twitter, where he often shares — and quickly deletes — his thoughts about the state of economics and politics.

A month ago, the hedge fund wizard said a stock market downturn that he expects to be “the mother of all crashes” was underway.

Burry also raised eyebrows after disclosures in August that his firm had sold off its entire stock portfolio during the second quarter, dumping shares of major names such as Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta."
72d318e0-fff9-4d17-9e88-146b1f832521,"“The Big Short” hedge fund manager Michael Burry cautioned that he sees another significant risk to market stability in the form of a “passive investing bubble” that he expects to burst.

Burry, who has frequently warned that the US economy is in the midst of a major downturn, argued a boom in forms of passive investment, such as ETFs and other index funds, has created a fresh hazard for investors in the current bear market.

“Difference between now and 2000 is the passive investing bubble that inflated steadily over the last decade,” Burry tweeted on Saturday. “All theaters are overcrowded and the only way anyone can get out is by trampling each other. And still the door is only so big.”

Burry, whose bet against the US housing market was made famous in the 2015 film “The Big Short,” often compares current market conditions to those seen during other crashes, such as the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009 and the dotcom bubble of 2000.

The hedge fund chief has since deleted the tweet. He has more than one million Twitter followers.

The Scion Asset Management boss has ripped passive investment on multiple occasions in the past. He first referred to the trend as a bubble in a November 2019 interview with Bloomberg, arguing the passive strategy was causing investors to miss opportunities to do their own research and capitalize on overlooked stocks.

Burry reiterated his concerns on Twitter in February 2021, decrying what he called “passive investing’s IQ drain” that was fueling a speculative bubble in the stock market.

Passive investors buy ETFs and other index funds as a bet that the basket of assets included in those packages will perform well over time. Some critics argue that an uptick in passive investors has made markets more vulnerable to major swings, as Bloomberg reported in July 2021.

Last week, Burry tweeted that he was concerned current market conditions are shaping up to be “worse than 2008,” when the implosion of the US housing market had a cascading effect that tanked the market for years.

Burry reiterated that view in another tweet last Saturday while sharing a chart showing the market’s dismal performance.

“13.48% stocks closed above their 200 day moving average yesterday. Bottom in 2009 was 1.2%. Bottom in 2020 was 2.8%. Currently at December 2007 levels,” he tweeted."

Net short positions against S&P 500 futures have risen in the past few months, attaining levels not seen in two years, which indicates that traders are increasing their bets that the index will go down, or at least hedging against that risk.

In another sign that a strong summer rally is coming to an end, short interest has picked up in popular technology stocks, according to the Journal.

This had led many traders and portfolio managers to question if the boost in stocks from the year's lows in mid-June marks the beginning of a new bull market or a temporary bear market rally. The S&P 500 has gone up 11% since June 16 but is still down 15% in 2022.

""There's so much skepticism, so we're still in the sell-the-rally mentality,"" Nationwide chief of investment research Mark Hackett told the Journal. ""If everybody feels we're in a bear market rally, it will almost become a self-fulfilling prophecy.""

In the coming week, investors will attempt to determine how well the economy is doing by analyzing the latest monthly jobs report, consumer confidence survey and manufacturing index.

Although inflation cooled a bit in July, leading investors to think at first that the Fed could soon slow the pace of its rate increases, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell put a dent in that thinking by saying that those price readings were ""welcome"" but fell ""far short"" of what the Fed is seeking.

Overall, investors again pulled money from U.S. stock funds in the latest week, with the funds logging $1.2 billion in net outflows in the period that ended Wednesday, according to Refinitiv Lipper data.

""The mood went from sour, to less sour, to now more sour,"" said Neuberger Berman Long Short Fund senior portfolio manager Charles Kantor. ""That's a very dangerous game in this environment.""

Investors are also increasing their bets against some of the large-cap technology stocks that have helped lead the market's summer rebound. It is unclear if they are placing an outright bet that stocks will fall or aiming to protect portfolios against downside risk, the Journal reported.

Greg Boutle, U.S. head of equity and derivative strategy at BNP Paribas, explained that ""positioning doesn't necessarily drive the direction of the market. But once the market trades in a certain direction, positioning often impacts how it trades."""
